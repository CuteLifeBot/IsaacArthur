The problem with trying to hide your civilization from others is that usually by the time you think to do that, it is already too late. 

**[00:00:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h00m29s)**  So today we return to the Alien Civilizations series to take a look at the concept of Hidden Civilizations. 

**[00:00:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h00m36s)**  Vast ancient extraterrestrial empires that lurk about the galaxy quietly or confine themselves to small regions of space, possibly even just their original home planet. 

**[00:00:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h00m47s)**  We might as well stick two qualifiers on this before we go further. 

**[00:00:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h00m51s)**  We are not talking today about alien civilizations that hide among us, nor about relatively new civilizations that try to keep their heads down. 

**[00:01:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h01m00s)**  For the latter, a new civilization on the galactic stage has good cause to tread softly in the early stages. 

**[00:01:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h01m07s)**  It’s almost certainly wasted effort, as we’ll see, but prudence still seems to suggest keeping quiet in new and unknown environments rather than stomping around with a megaphone asking if anyone is there. 

**[00:01:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h01m21s)**  No, our focus today is on civilizations that are committed to staying hidden over the long term -- not just being cautiously quiet while they are new, or apathetically quiet because they don’t care to talk with others. 

**[00:01:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h01m34s)**  We are going to discuss some of the reasons why you might want to do this, some of the reasons it might not work, and some of the ways you might be able to hide yourselves if you have certain technologies normally limited to fiction or speculative science. 

**[00:01:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h01m49s)**  Let's start with possible motivations. 

**[00:01:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h01m52s)**  Why would a civilization hide? 

**[00:01:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h01m54s)**  For instance, a species that just wants to keep to themselves because they’re xenophobic, but not especially hostile or fearful, has a different scope of possible actions than one that is afraid of being invaded. 

**[00:02:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h02m06s)**  As I mentioned in a previous episode, if you want to keep visitors away, hiding is often not your best solution under known physics. 

**[00:02:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h02m15s)**  In the absence of FTL, Faster than Light Travel, a spaceship can take centuries to get to its destination, and it is most likely a one way trip, especially if they can’t refuel when they arrive. 

**[00:02:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h02m27s)**  Telling a decelerating spaceship just approaching your solar system to go away amounts to signing their death warrant… or possibly yours. 

**[00:02:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h02m36s)**  The species living there might not care, but the rest of the hypothetical galactic community is going to be asking why those guys didn’t put up a simple beacon saying ‘stay away, this is our solar system, no visitors’. 

**[00:02:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h02m50s)**  Some of those folks, especially the civilization that ship came from, might decide to go ask in person. 

**[00:02:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h02m56s)**  Having an alien armada show up on your doorstep pissed off because you either killed their people by negligence or shot at them when they decided to try refueling is not a good way to avoid interacting with alien species. 

**[00:03:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h03m10s)**  Plus, ‘no trespassing’ beacons are pretty cheap, particularly considering you can safely bet no species that lacks FTL travel ever sends ships anywhere without pointing telescopes there first, so you don’t need to be transmitting very loudly. 

**[00:03:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h03m24s)**  The sheer cost of time and resources for interstellar travel tends to encourage you to do your homework. 

**[00:03:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h03m31s)**  And to keep doing it too. 

**[00:03:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h03m33s)**  Either the ship has telescopes of its own pointed at the destination as it cruises along, or it is getting periodic updates from the ones back home at light speed. 

**[00:03:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h03m43s)**  Telescopes, like transmitters, cost a lot less money than spaceships. 

**[00:03:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h03m48s)**  Now obviously if you’re hiding, sticking up big signs saying ‘go away, no visitors’ is not the best approach. 

**[00:03:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h03m56s)**  Our example here, however, is of a civilization that isn’t afraid of an unprovoked invasion, they’re just xenophobic. 

**[00:04:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h04m03s)**  A species that evolves to have technology does need to have some traits like curiosity and social behavior, but that doesn’t mean they like things besides themselves. 

**[00:04:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h04m13s)**  I tend to think extreme xenophobia toward other species is not too common with technological civilizations, but we can’t assume xenophobia is uncommon among aliens either. 

**[00:04:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h04m23s)**  What I do see being common is a fear of predators and a desire to hide. 

**[00:04:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h04m28s)**  Humans are very afraid of predators sneaking in at night and eating us. 

**[00:04:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h04m32s)**  Little kids frightened of shadows or boogeymen under their bed are not being irrational, they are obeying a very old and reasonable fear of being eaten. 

**[00:04:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h04m42s)**  That’s a real threat even to apex predators when they’re young, so a desire to hide from predators is probably almost as universal in alien civilizations as curiosity is. 

**[00:04:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h04m54s)**  One of the reasons hidden civilizations keeping quiet tends to resonate so well with people when discussing the Fermi Paradox is probably just that. 

**[00:05:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h05m03s)**  Fiction is overflowing with examples of evil predatory aliens sneaking out of the darkness to eat us, and it works as a story device because even though humans are about the most dangerous thing on this planet, we are still hardwired to fear the wolves. 

**[00:05:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h05m19s)**  A lot of seemingly irrational behavior in humans derives from what is essentially legacy software and hardware issues. 

**[00:05:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h05m26s)**  Figure on those being common in aliens too. 

**[00:05:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h05m29s)**  Behaviors rooted in biological imperatives which made sense originally, but are a bit hit and miss for decision-making in modern contexts. 

**[00:05:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h05m38s)**  A given alien might be more likely to want to hide than we are or less, but since impulse control is one of those things that comes hand in hand with a brain powerful enough to develop logic, reason, and technology, we can assume that aliens only try to hide their civilizations when it is at least vaguely reasonable to do so. 

**[00:05:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h05m57s)**  Now, that’s our first problem, if you assume the galaxy is full of predatory aliens hiding in the dark reaches of outer space, you do not want to hide from them on your home planet. 

**[00:06:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h06m09s)**  They are unlikely to be afraid to visit sunlit planets and to know that’s the easiest place to find prey. 

**[00:06:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h06m16s)**  Consider the growing list of exoplanets, accumulated at a time when we can barely put simple telescopes in space, and then try to imagine the kind of telescopes any species with basic interstellar travel might have. 

**[00:06:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h06m28s)**  Forget about radio signals by the way, that’s not a great search method even when you’re confined to a planet. 

**[00:06:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h06m35s)**  Nothing you need to hide from will be planetbound and they have better options. 

**[00:06:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h06m40s)**  Any species that hunts other civilizations by waiting for them to discover radio and TV is too stupid to be a threat. 

**[00:06:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h06m49s)**  We can broadcast all we want without concern because first off, it’s already too late since we’ve been broadcasting for a century, and secondly, anybody who can come here and hurt us never needed that to find us and already knew about us. 

**[00:07:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m06s)**  The probable presence of life on Earth is detectable by any number of other telltales that can be seen at a distance, we were betrayed by our own atmosphere a billion years before life crawled onto land. 

**[00:07:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m19s)**  No, if you want to hide, you don’t do it on your home planet. 

**[00:07:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m24s)**  You also probably don’t want to bother hiding your civilization anyway, just some piece of it as a backup. 

**[00:07:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m30s)**  We’ll discuss possible ways to hide in a bit. 

**[00:07:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m34s)**  Before that, let us walk through two scenarios. 

**[00:07:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m37s)**  For the first, we will be the predatory species folks should hide from, having shown up first on the galactic stage, and in the second we’ll be a species contemplating ways of hiding from them. 

**[00:07:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m49s)**  So here we are, an evil interstellar empire that arose a billion years ago. 

**[00:07:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m54s)**  How do we operate? 

**[00:07:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h07m56s)**  First, we need to assume we don’t really colonize much ourselves, it’s obviously very easy to keep alien civilizations from arising if you just colonize every planet in a galaxy, something that won’t take you more than a million years if you’ve got the ability to do interstellar travel in any sort of plausible way, and much faster if you have access to FTL travel. 

**[00:08:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h08m17s)**  Second, even a modestly expansive species is going to have at least close to K2 civilization numbers and resources, meaning they haven’t got any problems deploying a telescope to watch every single planet constantly and throwing together fleets of billions of ships. 

**[00:08:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h08m34s)**  Check out the Kardashev Scale or Dyson Sphere episodes to get some idea of the scale of these kind of civilizations. 

**[00:08:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h08m42s)**  Third, we have to assume that for some reason travel to other galaxies is off the table, otherwise while your predator species is lurking around the Milky Way Galaxy rather than colonizing it, some Kardashev 3 civilization will arise next door in Andromeda and decide to come pay a visit, and they will crush you. 

**[00:09:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h09m02s)**  Those are some fairly dubious assumptions, and if any of them aren’t in play this isn’t going to happen. 

**[00:09:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h09m08s)**  The biggest issue against you is time itself, because while any Kardashev 2 civilization - that’s one that’s just maximized their own solar system, not any others -- could easily send a big battleship or even a fleet to every solar system in the galaxy to monitor it for life, there’s no guarantee they are going to do that. 

**[00:09:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h09m29s)**  Let say we send a fleet to go watch planet X for signs of emerging intelligence and attack if they see any. 

**[00:09:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h09m36s)**  They get there ten thousand years later and set up shop to wait, because they see land life has just emerged. 

**[00:09:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h09m42s)**  Let’s consider this situation for a minute. 

**[00:09:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h09m45s)**  Even assuming we’ve got life extension or had these guys on ice for the trip, once they arrive the game has changed. 

**[00:09:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h09m53s)**  They, or their descendants, have a long time to sit on their ships twiddling their thumbs. 

**[00:09:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h09m59s)**  How many generations before they decide to just colonize the planet? 

**[00:10:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h10m03s)**  Or say screw it and nuke the planet instead of waiting for intelligent life to emerge? 

**[00:10:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h10m08s)**  Or fall in love with the critters on that planet and decide to protect them? 

**[00:10:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h10m12s)**  How long before they become aliens themselves, breeding in isolation for tens of millions of years? 

**[00:10:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h10m19s)**  You might need to send another extermination fleet to go deal with them, and since they will be expecting it, best build another fleet to handle the ones they, and all the other fleets you built, will be sending your way. 

**[00:10:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h10m31s)**  It’s hard for me to imagine humans opting to do the galaxy-wide perpetual extermination thing, and we’ve been known to try to kill off other humans who are genetically just a few thousand years removed from us. 

**[00:10:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h10m43s)**  If we assume the kind of extreme xenophobia that would make you try to keep purging a galaxy for a billion years, how likely are they to be cool with mutant branches of their own species who aren’t just a hundred generations removed, but a hundred thousand? 

**[00:10:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h10m59s)**  While it is darkly amusing to imagine a galaxy with a million empires, all descended from the same planet originally, trying to wipe each other out, don’t assume other species could safely emerge during that conflict. 

**[00:11:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h11m11s)**  They would still be monitoring everything and still be just as enthusiastically genocidal as before; so they’d still know if some new species emerged and would be able to divert a small fleet there to nuke them… or use whatever other method of extermination might be in vogue. 

**[00:11:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h11m28s)**  Genocide really does need to be done in person though, unless you are willing to go all-in and kill every planet in a galaxy that might spawn life, a K2 civilization could do that from home using the weapons platforms we discussed in Nicoll-Dyson Beams. 

**[00:11:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h11m43s)**  They just sterilize every planet once a galactic orbit. 

**[00:11:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h11m47s)**  Now if you are really worried about mutation from colonization, you probably need to go the machine route, preferably the dumb machine route. 

**[00:11:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h11m55s)**  We have discussed von Neumann Probes before, self-replicating machines that reach a nearby solar system, grab some raw materials, build some more probes, send those to new systems, rinse and repeat. 

**[00:12:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h12m07s)**  This is a good approach because you can slow down mutation in self-replicating machines and make sure everyone has the same priorities. 

**[00:12:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h12m16s)**  Unsurprisingly, it is one used in fiction a lot, usually as the evil artificial intelligence who just wants to kill any organic life. 

**[00:12:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h12m25s)**  Lots of good books on that notion, including my own favorite series, Alastair Reynold’s “Revelation Space”. 

**[00:12:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h12m31s)**  I’ve mentioned those before in other episodes so I’ll instead recommend a newer book by Dennis E. Taylor, “We are Legion, We are Bob”, which is a lot more light-hearted than when we usually see this technology portrayed in fiction. 

**[00:12:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h12m44s)**  A key point in that novel and its sequel is that even making copies of the minds can result in very large and quick divergence in behavior, and that is going to be hard to avoid in any truly sentient mind. 

**[00:12:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h12m57s)**  The ability to think up new solutions and analyze abstract problems pretty much guarantees that those copies will diverge from each other over time and new experiences, and if their philosophies and motives change you’ve got a problem. 

**[00:13:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h13m12s)**  So stupid is probably a better way to go, guided interstellar missiles that just have enough intelligence to do targeting and maybe maintenance. 

**[00:13:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h13m20s)**  Either delivering an explosive strike or something more biologically-targeted and clever like the proto-molecule we see in the Expanse series, TV or novels. 

**[00:13:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h13m30s)**  It could possibly be some very simple self-replicator that has a lot of the mutations safety controls on copying, “error checking algorithms” or some other options that we discussed in the self-replicating machines episode and a very limited mission. 

**[00:13:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h13m44s)**  Keep it simple, go to place, scan for basic signs of life, find a rock, replicate, destroy life, send mission data home, send replicators on to neighboring systems. 

**[00:13:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h13m56s)**  It could be dangerous giving it any real brains or free will, and even then, leaving a swarm of these things meandering around the galaxy probably isn’t a good idea. 

**[00:14:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h14m06s)**  You could have them hard-wired to automatically shut down and hibernate, only waking every so often to scan their particular area, but you might just be better off sending out new batches of them periodically instead. 

**[00:14:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h14m17s)**  When sending out specialized weapons designed for killing off intelligent life, it pays to be paranoid in your safety precautions. 

**[00:14:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h14m27s)**  So in that context, it’s kind of hard to imagine anyone doing this. 

**[00:14:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h14m31s)**  It’s so much easier to exterminate potential alien civilizations by simply colonizing their planets in the first place. 

**[00:14:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h14m39s)**  If you don’t want to colonize but still want to eliminate even the possibility of life evolving and posing a challenge, it is better to send your probes there looking for signs of life period, not just intelligence. 

**[00:14:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h14m51s)**  Or even just removing all the planets life could arise on, mining away all the elements and sending them home. 

**[00:14:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h14m57s)**  Now, let’s move on to case two -- folks who are thinking about hiding their civilization. 

**[00:15:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h15m02s)**  They are going to have all the concepts we just discussed available to them too, and I think they’d conclude what we just did. 

**[00:15:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h15m09s)**  If there were predators out killing intelligent species they’d have already been killed. 

**[00:15:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h15m15s)**  Anybody who has the willpower and skill to maintain a galaxy-wide, billion year long extermination process is going to be very, very good at it. 

**[00:15:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h15m26s)**  They won’t make rookie mistakes, and they might be monstrous villains, but this isn’t Hollywood so the villains aren’t going to be dumb. 

**[00:15:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h15m35s)**  If I can think of a dozen ways to kill off all life in a galaxy, they can too, and probably more, and if you asked me which method to use, I’d say all of them. 

**[00:15:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h15m45s)**  You don’t nuke someone’s planet, you nerve gas it, virus-bomb it, then nuke the place, and when you’re sure you’ve got everyone, you still send hazmat teams down to look. 

**[00:15:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h15m56s)**  Then you disassemble the planet as raw materials to build more armadas. 

**[00:16:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h16m00s)**  So we can conclude nobody is out there planning on killing us that we need to hide from. 

**[00:16:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h16m05s)**  Either they don’t exist, or they don’t want to kill us, or they just plain suck at genocide. 

**[00:16:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h16m12s)**  It seems to me, most species would draw these same conclusions. 

**[00:16:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h16m15s)**  What’s more, even if they conclude they should hide in case everyone else is doing it -- hence the quiet galaxy -- they are going to wonder why everyone is hiding since the logic is flimsy enough that at least a few species will decide not to. 

**[00:16:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h16m29s)**  Let’s assume they do hide, and they spend thousands of years hiding and improving their technology. 

**[00:16:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h16m35s)**  Someone will raise this issue again and say “Why don’t we build a probe, send it to a distant solar system, and have it set up shop there and broadcast a message? 

**[00:16:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h16m44s)**  That way, even if there is something to be afraid of the transmitter won’t reveal us. 

**[00:16:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h16m48s)**  Heck, we can even put a small observation post nearby to send a discrete laser signal home so we can monitor if someone comes and investigates the probe.” Now the immediate follow up to that is going to be someone asking why no one has already done this, other species would have thought of it too and someone will have tried it and concluded no aliens or no hostile ones and proceeded to move around more openly. 

**[00:17:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h17m13s)**  How many millions of years are you going to hide before you finally say nuts and abandon the effort? 

**[00:17:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h17m20s)**  Especially since the first ones to do so have the advantage in settling the galaxy, building their numbers up, and being safe from any previously quiet civilizations that may have more recently become a threat. 

**[00:17:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h17m32s)**  After all, a species that hid for fear of being exterminated might not be such nice guys themselves. 

**[00:17:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h17m39s)**  They might be so afraid of being killed off because they think it’s the logical thing to do and would like to do it themselves to others. 

**[00:17:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h17m46s)**  That is worth considering too since the ethically proper thing to do if hiding would seem to be to launch a few probes to get safely far from your civilization and then transmit warnings to others to hide. 

**[00:18:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m00s)**  So it’s not a good Fermi Paradox solution, because it seems very unlikely everyone would conclude hiding was best, particularly if anyone else was already openly moving around. 

**[00:18:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m11s)**  But just because it doesn’t work for the Fermi Paradox doesn’t mean nobody would do it. 

**[00:18:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m16s)**  There’s a lot of reasons why some species might decide they want to hide, and again you don’t need to hide everything. 

**[00:18:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m23s)**  I mean if I have been hiding my civilization for a few centuries, I might want to keep some of it hidden in reserve, to be on the safe side. 

**[00:18:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m32s)**  Just as we can send a probe far away to do its ‘Hello, is anyone there?’ transmission, we could also send off a very quiet colony ship somewhere to act as a backup. 

**[00:18:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m41s)**  So how do we hide a civilization if we want to? 

**[00:18:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m44s)**  That last part about the quiet colony ship gives us our first point to explore. 

**[00:18:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m49s)**  Wherever you hide should not be your home planet. 

**[00:18:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m52s)**  Too obvious, too hard to hide. 

**[00:18:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m55s)**  As we’ve discussed before, there is no stealth in space. 

**[00:18:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h18m59s)**  Planets are hard to hide and so are spaceships. 

**[00:19:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h19m02s)**  Similarly, you don’t need to hide your civilization, you need to hide your backup. 

**[00:19:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h19m07s)**  That could be a few thousand folks for a stable gene pool and copies of your records, but a high-tech civilization doesn’t necessarily need a few thousand people because they can use a few, and a lot of frozen embryos. 

**[00:19:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h19m20s)**  And one decently more advanced can probably store a digital copy of all their genetic information for every organism in their biosphere too. 

**[00:19:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h19m28s)**  And one just a little more advanced could store digital copies of all their citizens too. 

**[00:19:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h19m34s)**  Indeed, in a transhuman civilization odds are a lot of folks will have copies of their minds as a backup anyway, and likely many of them with a few rather discreetly tucked away. 

**[00:19:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h19m45s)**  I usually assume one bit of storage for one atom, we can’t do quite that well yet but we’re close. 

**[00:19:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h19m52s)**  And there’s options that might permit folks to do even better. 

**[00:19:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h19m55s)**  It’s not really necessary though since at that density of storage you can squeeze a billion gigabytes of data onto a nanogram of storage and that’s enough for a human memory, likely many times over again. 

**[00:20:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h20m07s)**  That’s whole metropolises worth of people on a grain of sand or the genetic information for whole ecosystems. 

**[00:20:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h20m15s)**  A few weeks back, in the episode Civilizations at the End of Time, we talked about keeping whole simulated universes in your pocket. 

**[00:20:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h20m24s)**  That was an extreme case, but keeping a whole civilizations backup memories in your pocket isn’t. 

**[00:20:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h20m31s)**  Our digital memory is bigger than that right now in the interest of fast and cheap memory, they might have the same interest too, and you might need to go bigger than the atomic scale for storage, but at the atomic scale you’d have no problem storing every human mind, all of our art and literature and history, and all the genetic information to replicate Earth, on something that would fit in your pocket. 

**[00:20:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h20m55s)**  However, we’ll be conservative and assume that with some additional protective equipment and casings, you might end up with a big cube weighing a ton and about a meter wide. 

**[00:21:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h21m05s)**  That’s a little inconvenient, but considering it’s storing an entire civilization we won’t complain that it requires a forklift to move due to all the shielding and various redundancies. 

**[00:21:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h21m15s)**  Ya know, built to last, because it’s hard to get an insurance policy or warranty for the high-tech equivalent of Noah’s Ark. 

**[00:21:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h21m23s)**  Where do you hide it? 

**[00:21:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h21m25s)**  Well first off you don’t hide ‘it’, you hide ‘them’, as it’s not likely to be something so resource intensive that you can’t make many of them. 

**[00:21:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h21m35s)**  Regardless, where is an optimal place to hide it? 

**[00:21:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h21m38s)**  And at the same time, where do you hide an actual existing biological civilization? 

**[00:21:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h21m44s)**  Again, not on your home planet. 

**[00:21:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h21m47s)**  We assume malevolent and genocidal civilizations are very committed and good at their job, so odds are reducing your homeworld to atomic dust is going to be on their task list and they’ve probably had whole blue ribbon committees and think tanks devoted to designing ways to track down and exterminate any survivors. 

**[00:22:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h22m08s)**  If you’ve got force fields like we discussed last week, sticking your archive inside a star is a decent approach, or even your whole civilization, since you don’t need to worry about your energy output being detectable. 

**[00:22:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h22m21s)**  Even pretty advanced and determined civilizations have to work hard for a long time to kill a sun. 

**[00:22:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h22m27s)**  It’s also kind of hard to hunt around for a needle in that haystack. 

**[00:22:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h22m31s)**  Ducking down inside a very large black hole might be a good option too, though getting out of either of those is a dubious proposition at best. 

**[00:22:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h22m41s)**  But the more realistic approach is not anywhere inside your solar system or even any solar system. 

**[00:22:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h22m47s)**  In between the stars there is a vast amount of empty space. 

**[00:22:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h22m51s)**  Only it isn’t empty, there’s all sorts of cold small objects out there, very hard to see even if you know what to look for, and incredibly numerous. 

**[00:23:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h23m00s)**  They’re hard to see because they are small and cold, and the reason why spaceships are easy to see is all the energy they give off while speeding up or slowing down. 

**[00:23:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h23m11s)**  They can also be seen by the heat they give off just maintaining their environment inside. 

**[00:23:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h23m15s)**  That’s a lot harder and shorter range though. 

**[00:23:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h23m18s)**  Now nothing can be completely hidden, but the less energy it gives off, the harder it is to see. 

**[00:23:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h23m25s)**  You could detect a colony hidden in a comet because the comet will be warmer than it should be, but there is a range of uncertainty about how much it should give off. 

**[00:23:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h23m35s)**  Some kilometer-wide ball of rock and ice in the interstellar void is soaking up some starlight, cosmic microwave background radiation, and other types of cosmic background radiation. 

**[00:23:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h23m46s)**  There’s more than microwaves incidentally, and it probably has some radioisotopes in its composition slowly decaying and giving off heat. 

**[00:23:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h23m54s)**  There’s some variation in all of that which makes it difficult to calculate how much some blob of interstellar flotsam should be giving off naturally. 

**[00:24:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h24m03s)**  That allows you a decent amount of power you can produce while still staying safely within those margins of error for detection. 

**[00:24:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h24m11s)**  What’s more, you could pick a rock that had a fair amount of radioisotopes, one from a spot near a recent supernova that’s got lots of fresh uranium and such, and just remove those materials. 

**[00:24:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h24m23s)**  You can scoop out all those radioisotopes so your own power generation can replace it or just harvest and use them instead. 

**[00:24:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h24m31s)**  Now searching all of those possible hidey-holes is a pretty Herculean task, but we are talking about a species willing to search a whole galaxy for life so you might assume they’d do it. 

**[00:24:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h24m43s)**  But as strange as it sounds, searching a whole galaxy for life-bearing planets is a lot easier than searching even a fairly small volume of interstellar space for a small habitat hidden inside a comet. 

**[00:24:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h24m56s)**  It’s the difference between searching a planet for cities and searching one beach for a single specific grain of sand that looks like all the others. 

**[00:25:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h25m06s)**  The more power you need to run your hidden civilization, the fewer places you could hide it and the easier those would be to find. 

**[00:25:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h25m14s)**  Trying to hide a whole O’Neill Cylinder housing thousands of people and needing gigawatts of power is a problem. 

**[00:25:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h25m21s)**  Interstellar rocks might give off less than a milliwatt of energy per square meter, you’d need some rock with at least a trillion square meters of surface area just to have a chance of hiding an O’Neill Cylinder’s emissions in one, so we’re talking about something many hundreds of kilometers across, a large asteroid or modest moon. 

**[00:25:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h25m40s)**  They’re also the first place you’d go look when hunting for survivors. 

**[00:25:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h25m44s)**  There’s not so many of these things in the interstellar void that you wouldn’t go take a peek, you search the biggest spots first and the smaller ones can hide less power. 

**[00:25:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h25m56s)**  Some small rotating habitat buried in an icy rock a kilometer across could probably afford to give off a milliwatt a square meter of excess power without being noticed and that would let you get away with a few thousand watts of power. 

**[00:26:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h26m10s)**  Enough to maybe support one person. 

**[00:26:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h26m12s)**  Maybe a few dozen to serve as caretakers with them doing cycles in cryogenic suspension, waiting for the aliens to leave and just waking people up to tend a small hydroponic garden and check the equipment and see if the bad guys left. 

**[00:26:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h26m26s)**  However, we already mentioned digital copies of minds and regular viewers of this channel know that it doesn’t necessarily take much power to run a civilization if it isn’t organic. 

**[00:26:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h26m39s)**  If you are computing down near the Landauer Limit for your area’s temperature, you can get a lot of calculations done on just a single watt of power, so one radioisotope generator designed to put out a few watts of power continuously for a billion years isn’t going to have any problems running a modest civilization on that juice. 

**[00:27:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h27m01s)**  We could hide that inside a chunk of ice about the size of a large house and even the most obsessively genocidal aliens would have problems finding and searching all of those. 

**[00:27:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h27m13s)**  So no one one is pulling that off unless they decide to convert the entire galaxy into raw materials and clearly no one is doing that. 

**[00:27:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h27m22s)**  If you want the specifics of how you can run a digital civilization on so little energy, check out the Matrioshka Brain episode or Civilizations at the End of Time’s discussion of black hole civilizations. 

**[00:27:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h27m35s)**  Now speaking of black holes, they are one of the ways often suggested to hide power emissions completely, and even then you’d probably have some leakage. 

**[00:27:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h27m45s)**  You can’t hide a Dyson sphere with one, too much gravity, but you could partially hide its emissions by having a second layer around your original Dyson Sphere that was highly reflective to its waste heat frequencies and reflected all that into a black hole. 

**[00:28:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h28m01s)**  This is very dubious from a thermodynamics perspective but thermodynamics where black holes are concerned is somewhat iffy so we can’t close the door on the option completely. 

**[00:28:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h28m12s)**  Still, it is not a particularly realistic option because on top of leakage or gravity being detectable, buildings such things is not covert, and if everyone sees you building your secret bunker it’s not too secret even if it is invisible when complete. 

**[00:28:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h28m29s)**  But we do talk about using artificial black holes for power here a lot so we’ll use that as our last example for today. 

**[00:28:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h28m37s)**  Note that we are talking about artificial black holes too, naturally occurring ones are not very common, odds are your civilization has none within many hundreds of light years, and there could be a million solar systems closer to hand. 

**[00:28:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h28m52s)**  They also tend to have accretion disks, so suddenly blocking those by building your civilization there is going to be a red flag, though like hiding in a sun, hiding in an accretion disk might not be a bad idea if you can survive there. 

**[00:29:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h29m09s)**  Anyway, focusing on artificial black holes, if you have the technology to make small black holes -- Kugelblitz black holes - then we can grab some very remote and decently large body, scoop out its insides, line it with a reflective material, and slap in an equal mass black hole. 

**[00:29:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h29m27s)**  Incidentally trying to feed a black hole waste heat infrared light is harder than it sounds. 

**[00:29:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h29m34s)**  The idea of a Kugelblitz black hole is that you use ultra-tiny and dense gamma rays to make one, but funneling infrared light and microwaves, the waste heat of a hidden civilization, into our black hole would actually be rather difficult and maybe impossible. 

**[00:29:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h29m51s)**  Sounds strange since black holes are all-consuming gravity wells which even light can’t escape, but micro-black holes are smaller than atomic nuclei. 

**[00:30:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h30m01s)**  Light can’t get out of them but getting it in there in the first place is a lot harder. 

**[00:30:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h30m06s)**  Again, probably impossible, and there’s no way you are getting all the light in there. 

**[00:30:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h30m11s)**  We’ll handwave that away though and assume you could dispose of most of your waste heat into them. 

**[00:30:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h30m17s)**  Amusingly, this option is better for organic civilizations than digital ones. 

**[00:30:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h30m21s)**  They don’t need much power or space and can hide in a rock the size of a house running on less power than a flashlight. 

**[00:30:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h30m28s)**  However, the black holes that emit flashlight levels of energy tend to mass trillions of tons, modest asteroid territory and in that range where if you’re hiding it in a small body you might get noticed just by the gravity given off. 

**[00:30:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h30m43s)**  Alternatively, a rotating habitat designed for just a few thousand people and a modest ecosystem only needs to be a kilometer or so wide and needs power supplies in the hundreds of megawatts, or gigaton black hole territory, and a kilometer-wide block of ice masses about a gigaton. 

**[00:31:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h31m01s)**  So it works out nicely, and if you’re smart you set the icy body to have a plausible but high speed in a direction that takes it far away, preferably out of the galaxy, though clever hunters might find that suspicious enough to go check. 

**[00:31:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h31m16s)**  Intergalactic space is a way better place to hide, and even the most determined hunters might shrug at trying to hunt through that or chase you if you’ve left the galaxy. 

**[00:31:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h31m27s)**  I tend to be pretty skeptical about using black holes for heat disposal, it’s very dicey where the Laws of thermodynamics are concerned and I suspect it only seems to work in theory because we don’t fully know how black holes work, but I wanted to raise the option since folks do suggest using them this way. 

**[00:31:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h31m46s)**  You can’t hide a normal black hole either, again the mass issue, but gravity is a very weak force so a micro-black hole’s gravity probably would escape notice. 

**[00:31:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h31m57s)**  Fundamentally, if you can dump waste heat into one, it is a very good way to hide a civilization and about the only way you could hope to hide a biological one, rather than a low power digital one, inside known physics. 

**[00:32:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h32m12s)**  And that’s where we’ll stop for the day. 

**[00:32:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h32m14s)**  What’s our summary for Hidden Aliens? 

**[00:32:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h32m16s)**  Short form, I don’t expect to encounter them often, and I don’t mean because they’re hard to find since they’re hiding. 

**[00:32:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h32m23s)**  It’s just not a good approach, we have to come up with way too many convoluted motives for both the civilization hiding and who they are hiding from, who also seems to need to bypass a lot of strategies they should follow for hunting, like just colonizing everything themselves. 

**[00:32:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h32m41s)**  On the other hand, I would expect civilizations to hide things, and the methods we discussed today work for hiding observational outposts or secret archives and backups. 

**[00:32:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tEBn8bc0k-I&t=00h32m53s)**  Next week we will be looking at some lesser known technologies that haven’t gained as much attention as some of the flashier technology, but are shaping the landscape for the future just as much or more, in Quiet Revolution.
