Space is big. 

**[00:00:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h00m02s)**  Really big. 

**[00:00:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h00m03s)**  You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. 

**[00:00:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h00m08s)**  But as big is the Universe is, that’s just peanuts compared to the Multiverse. 

**[00:00:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h00m25s)**  So today we will be looking at some of the stranger implications of the notion of the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and when it comes to strange, mind-bending, or ludicrous perspectives on reality, not many people could beat Douglas Adams, the late great author of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. 

**[00:00:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h00m44s)**  This is not an episode about him or that series, but it is dedicated to him and indeed he’s probably the person most directly responsible for my own perspective on this subject, and since this episode was set to come out on the anniversary of his untimely death, it seemed fitting to give him a tribute. 

**[00:01:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h01m01s)**  I’m going to take for a given that most of my audience is already quite familiar with his work, and if not, I cannot suggest strongly enough that you become so. 

**[00:01:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h01m11s)**  I’d recommend beginning with the original BBC radio production of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which he later adapted into the book series. 

**[00:01:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h01m19s)**  Those of you already familiar with that show doubtless recognized our intro music today, the Eagles’ “Journey of the Sorcerer”, which served as the intro and outro music for that show. 

**[00:01:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h01m30s)**  It also happens to be my own first exposure to audiobooks and fiction. 

**[00:01:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h01m34s)**  I read tons as a kid but it was all non-fiction to that point, and that radio show, along with the books adaptations he narrated himself, are what got me reading fiction, since there weren’t many audiobooks at the time so you often could find only one or two audiobooks by an author and had to read their other novels. 

**[00:01:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h01m51s)**  I didn’t know it at the time but I’d already been exposed heavily to him from his time as a writer on Doctor Who, during the Fourth Doctor era. 

**[00:02:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h02m00s)**  Having been principally raised by my mother and my grandfather, who were both big scifi fans, reruns of Doctor Who on PBS were a normal staple of my childhood and indeed my mother knitted me a replica of the ridiculously long scarf that character was known for, and I always consider Tom Baker the Doctor the others are measured against. 

**[00:02:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h02m19s)**  I suspect Adams rather enjoyed alternate realities and time travel as story options since they give you a virtually unlimited supply of strange new places to visit, and he certainly took his audience to visit many of those worlds before he left us. 

**[00:02:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h02m35s)**  We might as well begin our topic with explaining how this Many Worlds Interpretation arose and what it means, and we are going to see that it has a lot more strange implications than we usually see when its discussed in fiction, some of which are arguably rather dreadful. 

**[00:02:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h02m50s)**  Of course to do this we have to discuss Quantum Mechanics a bit. 

**[00:02:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h02m53s)**  Don’t Panic though, while the various interpretations of Quantum can be quite mind-boggling, they don’t require much technical knowledge. 

**[00:03:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h03m02s)**  At the beginning of the twentieth century physicists were of the opinion we lived in a totally mechanistic universe. 

**[00:03:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h03m08s)**  The notion at the time was the Universe worked on strictly mechanistic cause and effect lines, so with enough computers one could calculate the future exactly. 

**[00:03:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h03m18s)**  It was deemed impossible to perform such calculations, and even with modern computers it would not be, but from a philosophical standpoint it didn’t matter if we could do it or not, just that everything was predetermined. 

**[00:03:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h03m30s)**  Then along comes Quantum, which gives us apparently random events, throwing that right out the window. 

**[00:03:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h03m37s)**  There are a ton of Interpretations of why these events are random or random-seeming, but the two big ones are the Copenhagen Interpretation and Many Worlds Interpretation. 

**[00:03:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h03m47s)**  Copenhagen holds that there is just the one reality, or at least only one pertinent to quantum events, and that everything in it is in a constant state of fluctuation when not being observed. 

**[00:03:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h03m58s)**  Simply put if you flip a coin, it is heads and tails until you observe it being one or the other. 

**[00:04:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h04m05s)**  Now most of this random chaos is going on deep down at the atomic scale and tends to average out, so that most macroscopic events are still essentially determined in advance, but they still can bubble up to effect events bigger than the atomic. 

**[00:04:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h04m20s)**  That actual coin might be 99.999% likely to be heads, but there’s still a finite chance it is tails until observed, and indeed a small but non-zero chance it will have turned into a Jelly Baby. 

**[00:04:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h04m34s)**  If any given atom has a chance to decay, transmute, or move in a random fashion, it stands to reason there is an even smaller chance that two of them should do so at about the same time and place. 

**[00:04:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h04m46s)**  Thus it stands to reason a few metal atoms might turn themselves into some sugar molecules. 

**[00:04:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h04m51s)**  There’s an even smaller chance hundreds might do this, or trillions. 

**[00:04:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h04m55s)**  The odds of this occurring are so small they would be preceded by a decimal point followed by enough zeros to fill a book, but they are still not zero. 

**[00:05:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h05m05s)**  Now Many Worlds, and most Quantum Interpretations, hold to the same assumption, that these freakish improbabilities and random events can occur. 

**[00:05:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h05m15s)**  Many Worlds however posits that there are many different worlds, one for each scenario to have played out. 

**[00:05:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h05m21s)**  People over-simplify this though in terms of scale, they think “There’s a world where I skipped lunch today and one where I did not, one where I became president or did not”, that sort of thing. 

**[00:05:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h05m33s)**  This is not sufficient, and does not fully cover the options. 

**[00:05:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h05m37s)**  These types of alternate realities always terribly ignore the Butterfly Effect, which has nothing to do with quantum beyond ensuring that any quantum event that percolates up to the macroscopic scale will alter future history. 

**[00:05:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h05m50s)**  We’ll discuss the Butterfly Effect more when we get to Isaac Asimov’s notion of Psychohistory this summer though. 

**[00:05:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h05m57s)**  The basic result of the Butterfly Effect though is that even minor events like some guy you never met deciding not to get a haircut on Tuesday instead of Friday can avalanche to affect your life, especially if he did it a century or two ago, as time magnifies the effect. 

**[00:06:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h06m15s)**  Many folks tend to think this quantum randomness really does not percolate to the day-to-day macroscopic level, we shall now demonstrate that it does. 

**[00:06:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h06m24s)**  At the moment, based on channel size, the number of folks who will be watching this episode on the day it comes out should be twenty thousand or so and a good portion of you will be thinking about your next meal, while some are eating it now. 

**[00:06:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h06m38s)**  For the former, you probably have not yet selected what to eat and may be prone to suggestions. 

**[00:06:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h06m43s)**  I wrote down six, and used Australia National University’s online quantum number generator, and it selected a number, one to six, corresponding to cheeseburgers from those options. 

**[00:06:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h06m56s)**  Out of a sample of thousands, we can almost guarantee a decent number of you will now decide to have a cheeseburger. 

**[00:07:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h07m03s)**  This quantum cheeseburger you or someone else now eats is definitely a macroscopic event. 

**[00:07:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h07m09s)**  This quantum cheeseburger will impact the rest of your life and human history. 

**[00:07:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h07m14s)**  One of you will go to the pub to acquire this quantum cheeseburger and a pint of beer and in doing so will meet the gal or guy of your dreams and having a kid as a result. 

**[00:07:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h07m25s)**  The quantum cheeseburger will have fundamentally altered your destiny. 

**[00:07:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h07m29s)**  That randomly selected food option, produced by quantum chance, has now changed the fate of the Universe. 

**[00:07:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h07m36s)**  And this is what quantum tell us, and to the best of our knowledge, no computer, not even a solar system spanning Matrioshka Brain, could have predicted the emergence of the Quantum Cheeseburger nor its subsequent impact on humanity. 

**[00:07:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h07m50s)**  Indeed, as my audience is strongly composed of technophiles, many of you shall further mess with the notion of determinism at the macroscopic scale by visiting such a quantum random number generator and making a decision based on its outcome. 

**[00:08:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h08m06s)**  Under the butterfly effect each of these decisions will ripple outward and impact everything, amplifying their effect as time goes on. 

**[00:08:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h08m15s)**  Now of course that’s how it plays out in the Copenhagen Interpretation. 

**[00:08:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h08m19s)**  In Many Worlds, the Quantum Cheeseburger exists in one reality, and the other five options each have their own, the Quantum Bratwurst, the Quantum Salad, the Quantum Lasagna, the Quantum Clam Chowder, and even the Quantum Chimichanga now exist and are irrevocably dominating the future history of their alternate Universes. 

**[00:08:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h08m39s)**  But down at the quantum scale these events occur endlessly, and one must invariably consider that should Many Worlds be true, then all possible states exist. 

**[00:08:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h08m50s)**  This is like the Library of Babel. 

**[00:08:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h08m52s)**  In this hypothetical library every sequence of letters was written down to fill a book, much as though an infinite numbers of monkeys were given typewriters and set to replicate the works of Shakespeare. 

**[00:09:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h09m03s)**  Now if we gave a monkey a keyboard that just had individual keys, no shifts or mods, one for all the capital letters and punctuations, we’ll say 100 keys total, or ten-squared, we know that any given letter or symbol has a 1 in 100 chance of being pressed, and the same for the next digit, so that any two letter combination has a 1 in 100 times 100, or 1 in 10,000, chance of occurring. 

**[00:09:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h09m27s)**  1 in a million for any given 3 symbol combination, one in a trillion for any 6 symbol combination. 

**[00:09:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h09m34s)**  A 22-symbol combination would be 1 in 100^22, or 10^44, that would be 100 Tredecillion, a Tredecillion being 10^42. 

**[00:09:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h09m47s)**  On a roll of paper wide enough to hold 22 characters a line, and say a centimeter per line, the full scroll of every 22-character combination would be some 10^42 meters long. 

**[00:09:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h09m58s)**  10 million, billion times longer than the Observable Universe is wide. 

**[00:10:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h10m04s)**  And if we assumed each line and the paper it was on weighed a gram, it would have a mass of 10^41 kilograms, about 2% of the mass of our entire galaxy. 

**[00:10:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h10m15s)**  On that immense scroll containing every possible 22-symbol combination of those 100 characters, somewhere on that will be the phrase “I Can Has Cheezburger?” And that’s just 22 characters, just one more and it would take an entire galactic mass to make the paper to write them all down. 

**[00:10:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h10m34s)**  You would only need 27 characters to need the entire mass of the Observable Universe turned into paper to hold all those combinations. 

**[00:10:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h10m42s)**  Indeed you’d use all that mass just to have all the monkeys and typewriters needed to produce the 22-character code. 

**[00:10:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h10m49s)**  Your typical book has somewhere around a million characters in it, and you’d need 10 to the 2 millionth power of these books to fill this variation of the Library of Babel, and such a thing would not fit into a library the size of this Universe, not even close, even if we could find the mass to make all those books and prevent it undergoing gravitational collapse. 

**[00:11:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h11m11s)**  It still would not even if the ‘paper’ was one atom thick and inscribed at the atomic scale. 

**[00:11:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h11m17s)**  But somewhere in that Library, among all the random nonsense, is the script for this episode and a copy of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. 

**[00:11:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h11m26s)**  Indeed there would be endless trillions of them that were functionally identical, one typo here or there, a double space, a meaningless word change that didn’t impact the story. 

**[00:11:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h11m36s)**  That’s with just a million characters. 

**[00:11:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h11m40s)**  Now consider that while a book might be just a million or so characters, your body is composed of trillions of cells each composed of trillions of atoms. 

**[00:11:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h11m49s)**  As indeed is the quantum cheeseburger. 

**[00:11:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h11m51s)**  In a large enough universe, if every particle is arranged randomly, somewhere in that massive spread of material is an identical copy of you, down to every memory you have, along with many more that are functionally identical, and some will be holding cheeseburgers and even ones with bacon on them, which is always better. 

**[00:12:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h12m12s)**  And since these alternate universes need to include every combination and position of particles that could possibly have occurred since the beginning of time we end up with a number so ridiculously huge that you need to put exponents on your exponents to write it down. 

**[00:12:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h12m28s)**  Andrei Linde and Vitaly Vanchurin of Stanford put that value at somewhere around 10 to the 10 to the 77 power. 

**[00:12:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h12m37s)**  That is a number so big that if each of them had their own unique identifier code, a harddrive just containing all those addresses only would massively exceed the size of the Universe. 

**[00:12:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h12m49s)**  We would say that any scenario that is possible, no matter how improbable, has to be going on somewhere, but at this scale for all practical purposes the impossible will seem to occur. 

**[00:13:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h13m03s)**  Not only is there a universe right now where you flicked on your light switch and a random chunk of furniture in your house turned into a bunch of gold ingots, totally coincidentally, but there’s one that when you flipped it off and on again, another piece of furniture did so too. 

**[00:13:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h13m18s)**  And on and on, so that even when scientists came by and repeated the process a thousand times, it ‘worked’ each time. 

**[00:13:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h13m26s)**  Totally coincidentally, in virtually every other universe it did not, but in one, indeed in a near countless number of them, it did work. 

**[00:13:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h13m35s)**  So everyone in those universes thinks somehow this impossible light switch makes gold, even the most ardent skeptic. 

**[00:13:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h13m43s)**  In Many Worlds, there will be ones where the physical laws will seem different, even if they are not. 

**[00:13:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h13m50s)**  We have no idea if Many Worlds is the correct interpretation, indeed we tend to think it is probably impossible to prove or disprove any of the major interpretations, but of course it is a very popular one with science fiction authors. 

**[00:14:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h14m05s)**  They like to have it so folks can travel between these Universes too. 

**[00:14:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h14m08s)**  I used to use as an example the old 90’s TV show Sliders for this, but most of you will be more familiar with the Portal Gun from Rick &amp; Morty, which is honestly a much better show too. 

**[00:14:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h14m20s)**  Now we have no idea how you would go about doing this and I personally think it is impossible, but at the same time totally possible, and the same for time travel. 

**[00:14:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h14m30s)**  Let me give you an example. 

**[00:14:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h14m32s)**  Some mad scientist with a doctorate in quantum physics creates a box he believes will take him to any time or reality. 

**[00:14:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h14m40s)**  He doesn’t know it, but what it actually does is vaporize him, he knows about that part but thinks it just randomizes all his particles and his pattern is imposed on some random matter in a different time or Universe. 

**[00:14:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h14m53s)**  This doctor gets in the machine and vaporizes himself, no transport actually happens. 

**[00:14:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h14m59s)**  Yet at the same time, so to speak, at some time and place in the multiverse, random quantum chances assemble that box and out steps a clone of the doctor, or one close enough to make no difference, down to the memories. 

**[00:15:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h15m14s)**  Indeed there would be one where those false memories include having done this hundreds of time with dozens of companions over the centuries. 

**[00:15:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h15m22s)**  It doesn’t matter that this process is impossible, he thinks it works, and indeed it may be argued that it does. 

**[00:15:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h15m30s)**  People argue all the time about continuity of consciousness when it some to scifi transporters that rip you apart and reassemble you elsewhere from other matter, or that if we took the exact image of you and beamed that information to a super-3D printer light years away where it reassembled you, or close enough to make no difference, that what arrived is indeed you. 

**[00:15:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h15m51s)**  If you suddenly wake up on a distant Earth-like planet far away in space and time, but remembering this life, even if those memories are fake, just random quantum assembled data, is that still you? 

**[00:16:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h16m04s)**  If that copy was further away in space than light could have reached, is that faster than light travel? 

**[00:16:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h16m10s)**  To the people of Zaphod II in Universe 8675309, who have a warp drive that totally does not actually work but coincidentally their ships keep assembling from random matter at the expected destination and time, it’s going to be a hard sell to convince them it doesn’t work. 

**[00:16:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h16m29s)**  On this channel we discuss the Fermi Paradox a lot, the question of where all the aliens are, and one of the thought streams we follow on that is the Dyson Dilemma, which essentially argues that the very presence of the night sky with visible stars in it, indicates very strongly that there are no other technological civilizations within a billion or so light years of us. 

**[00:16:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h16m51s)**  I put that theory together formally a couple years back, having some time on my hands from a cold, and decided make a video out of it while doped up on Nyquil, thus spawning this channel, and yes that is pretty much how it happened. 

**[00:17:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h17m04s)**  When I did, I set a number of conditions on the idea that had to be true for it to be right. 

**[00:17:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h17m10s)**  I also stipulated how even a lot of violations would result in the same outcome, such as having access to a better power source than stars. 

**[00:17:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h17m19s)**  One of those though was that folks might discover a way to travel to alternate realities that was easier than traveling to other stars, or even other planets. 

**[00:17:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h17m28s)**  If Many Worlds is true and one could pick alternate Universes to travel too, then the Dyson Dilemma essentially breaks down. 

**[00:17:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h17m36s)**  You don’t need to colonize other solar systems or build massive energy collectors or artificial habitats around your own sun to form a Dyson Swarm because you can just step off to a copy of your own planet where everything is about the same only an asteroid landed on the tribe of the first proto-humans, or a plague got them, or the hypothetical Adam and Eve who first evolved to what we would call sapience, never did so. 

**[00:18:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h18m01s)**  Now weirdly that’s one of the conditions of the Dyson Dilemma folks least argue with me about. 

**[00:18:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h18m06s)**  It’s the condition for constant expansion when you can comfortably do so that seems to rub folks the wrong way, but occasionally someone will argue that it isn’t a solid condition because since those realities are finite, the ones with a mostly identical Earth minus people, should fill up eventually and sooner than later since there should be other versions of Earth that also developed the technology to slide between Universes and will be competing to populate those same empty versions. 

**[00:18:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h18m34s)**  This though is where things get a bit weird, or get weirder anyway, everything about quantum is a bit weird. 

**[00:18:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h18m41s)**  First we have to decide if they are just transporting to another reality, their information imposed on some collections of atoms there, or if they are actually transferring mass and energy to that new Universe. 

**[00:18:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h18m54s)**  If the latter, we’d not only have to keep in mind there should now be a huge additional number of possible forkings in that Universe since you just added a trillion, trillion new atoms to it by stepping in, but also that those realities can effect each other, and so the number of possible universes arguably leaps up in a ridiculously huge way, making running out of them arguably impossible. 

**[00:19:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h19m17s)**  Alternatively we would consider the former, that you are just copying your state to another reality. 

**[00:19:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h19m23s)**  This also makes it impossible to run out of new spaces. 

**[00:19:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h19m27s)**  Whether or not such a machine to genuinely slide between these Universes could be built, if these places do exist people will think they can be built. 

**[00:19:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h19m36s)**  Because there is going to be a version of reality where, much like our Doctor stepping out the box, both of which just came into existence, there should be a Universe with an unpopulated Earth where a copy of you has just spawned standing there with a bunch of fake random memories ending with having stepped into a reality-slider box. 

**[00:19:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h19m54s)**  Let’s assume we have a machine that takes a pattern inside it and copies it onto some random atoms in another reality. 

**[00:20:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h20m02s)**  To keep it simple we copy one iron cube exactly a million atoms high, wide, and tall to the exact peak of Mount Everest. 

**[00:20:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h20m11s)**  Now there are endless trillions of realities, all different from ours, where someone did exactly that same transport to that same location, producing the exact same result, so only one reality is needed to satisfy all those Universes, that transported the iron box there. 

**[00:20:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h20m29s)**  So you cannot run out of room if every possible configuration of reality exists, even if those are finite, because many of those realities will be taking an action that results in the identical outcome. 

**[00:20:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h20m41s)**  That’s why it’s a condition breaker on the Dyson Dilemma, though not the Fermi Paradox, if all possible scenarios for the Universe exist then there is one where there’s intelligent aliens everywhere and one where we are the only ones. 

**[00:20:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h20m55s)**  Now I don’t think such a thing is possible, indeed I’m not a big fan of Many Worlds, which has nothing to do with its scientific merit, I just don’t like what it implies. 

**[00:21:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h21m06s)**  It comes back to the whole free will and determinism thing, I don’t like the idea that there are trillions of near identical versions of me each writing this script right now. 

**[00:21:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h21m15s)**  I don’t like the idea of thinking of them as the same person or that only a specific and exact copy of me down to the subatomic particles is actually me, since my body is constantly taking in new particles and memories. 

**[00:21:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h21m30s)**  Yet I am, by any sane definition, still the same person I was when I started writing this sentence, even though I’ve inhaled trillions of new oxygen molecules and exhaled trillions of carbon dioxide particles whose constituent atoms were part of me earlier today. 

**[00:21:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h21m47s)**  Even though I now have memories I didn’t have ten seconds ago. 

**[00:21:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h21m51s)**  Of course I said by ‘any sane definition’, and when I say that I don’t necessarily mean the non-sane ones are wrong. 

**[00:21:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h21m59s)**  I don’t think it would be possible to remain sane if someone genuinely, down to the core of their being, did not believe they had free will and an identity. 

**[00:22:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h22m10s)**  Thus I hang out in the philosophical camp known as Compatibilism, even if I tend to think Immanuel Kant probably had a point when he called that line of thinking ‘a wretched subterfuge’ But these are the kind of issues we are faced with when considering the issue of near infinite improbabilities, and even without Many Worlds it can still arise in an infinite Universe or one so large as to encompass all possible states which might exist in a given Observable Volume. 

**[00:22:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h22m40s)**  People often misinterpret the Big Bang Theory to say that the whole Universe came from a point-like object, or a very small one, when it actually says the chunk we can see presumably did, that original proto-verse pre-expansion is thought to be a lot bigger than the bit we can see now and quite possibly infinite, so that the proto-Universe started infinite and our chunk is just a finite part of the infinite whole which expanded from a finite part of the original, also infinite whole. 

**[00:23:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h23m14s)**  We have no idea about that right now either. 

**[00:23:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h23m15s)**  We also have a name for the Doctor or other folks who sprung out of nowhere with fully formed bodies and minds, and that’s a Boltzmann Brain, a topic we will be looking at in detail this summer. 

**[00:23:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h23m26s)**  It doesn’t require Quantum either, just particles randomly bouncing around forming a pattern that just happens to be a thinking life form, and extreme example of what presumably caused abiogenesis on this planet. 

**[00:23:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h23m40s)**  But that’s going to finish us off for today, like most episodes in this series, you’re probably coming away with more questions than answers, and I’d encourage you to look around the comments section for discussions or come join us at the Facebook or Reddit Groups, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, to discuss those more. 

**[00:23:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h23m58s)**  With the channel’s wild growth this last year, I can’t actually reply to most comments anymore but I still try to read them all and reply to as many as I can, fortunately there’s a lot of other clever folks hanging around the channel to talk to. 

**[00:24:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h24m11s)**  The schedule of episodes for the near-future is a little undetermined, at least at the time I’m writing this. 

**[00:24:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h24m17s)**  As you may be aware I’m teaming up again with my friend Fraser Cain of Universe Today for another episode collaboration, the topic being resource extraction and utilization in space, which is going to go all the way up to disassembling planets, and we’re keeping the date on that a bit fluid since it’s hard to work as a team with deadlines. 

**[00:24:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FaEkdQiweVE&t=00h24m37s)**  That topic was picked from among suggestions by our various patrons on Patreon, actually quite a few folks suggested that one, and if you’d like to help support the channel, you can follow the link to our Patreon account in the episode description.
