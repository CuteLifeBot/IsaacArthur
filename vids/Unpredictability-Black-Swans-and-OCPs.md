So today we will be ending the year by discussing the predictability of the future. 

**[00:00:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h00m15s)**  This seemed an appropriate topic for a channel focused on science and futurism, since it is so popular for folks to make predictions about the future right before the end of the year. 

**[00:00:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h00m26s)**  We do that year round on the channel so I thought it more appropriate to discuss the uncertainty of predictions. 

**[00:00:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h00m33s)**  We have two key concepts I wanted to bring up in relation to this, though they are not our main focus themselves. 

**[00:00:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h00m40s)**  The first is Black Swan Theory and Events, and the second is Outside Context Problems, a pretty extreme form of black swan event. 

**[00:00:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h00m49s)**  They are very similar in most regards and both discuss not so much the unpredictability of the future but rather the disruption caused by such events. 

**[00:00:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h00m58s)**  I was considering also discussing Isaac Asimov’s notion of Psychohistory, of predicting the broad trends of future events, but I think we will save that for another time. 

**[00:01:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h01m09s)**  Instead after introduce the concept I am going to discuss a few Black Swans we might see in terms of technology and some of the disruptions they might cause. 

**[00:01:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h01m19s)**  We will start with explaining Black Swans. 

**[00:01:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h01m22s)**  Black Swan Events is a concept that was coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, The Black Swan, and I’ll explain that in a moment. 

**[00:01:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h01m31s)**  The name Black Swan has a simple derivation. 

**[00:01:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h01m34s)**  Historically all swans we saw were white, so we assumed there were no black swans. 

**[00:01:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h01m39s)**  The term Black Swan came to be one used to describe something non-existent. 

**[00:01:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h01m45s)**  As you probably know they do exist in Australia and after being discovered the term mutated to mean something you did not think existed but in hindsight is not exactly surprising. 

**[00:01:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h01m55s)**  There are tons of black birds and no obvious tough hurdle to getting that mutation to your feather color nor to survival. 

**[00:02:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m03s)**  It’s not a neon green glow in the dark feather color, something that would seem an improbable mutation, and which would seem a hindrance to survival for any critter which wants to stay concealed. 

**[00:02:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m14s)**  In hindsight the existence of a black swan seems incredibly obvious. 

**[00:02:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m18s)**  It would not be surprising if they did not exist, but there is nothing surprising about their existence. 

**[00:02:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m24s)**  This is the key concept of a Black Swan Event, it has to match three criteria. 

**[00:02:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m29s)**  First, it has to be unexpected. 

**[00:02:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m32s)**  Not necessarily totally so but it has to be hard to predict. 

**[00:02:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m36s)**  Second, it has to have a major impact when it occurs, something that majorly changes civilization. 

**[00:02:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m42s)**  Third, it has to be clear in hindsight. 

**[00:02:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m45s)**  I’ve heard this concept get used in a lot of cases where it should not apply, especially in the world of finance it has become a bit of buzzword. 

**[00:02:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h02m52s)**  I saw an article that was bringing up possible black swans for the economy and included the retirement of the President of European Central Bank. 

**[00:03:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h03m01s)**  Since the current incumbent is almost 70 years old, I have difficulty imagining what is particularly unpredictable about that gentleman retiring. 

**[00:03:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h03m09s)**  Needless to say an actual Black Swan ought to be something that genuinely matches those criteria. 

**[00:03:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h03m15s)**  Tons tend to be offered up which do not, or at best maybe scrape in as pretty surprising, having a fairly large impact, or being more obvious in hindsight. 

**[00:03:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h03m24s)**  I tend to distrust a lot of the examples given from old history, politics, or warfare because folks tend to have blinders about recording such events accurately or viewing them without bias. 

**[00:03:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h03m36s)**  And in any event we are most interested in those relating to science and technology today anyway, so here are some examples of those relating to science and engineering. 

**[00:03:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h03m44s)**  The Chernobyl, Three-Mile-Island, and Fukushima Nuclear accidents The Sinking of the Titanic The Hinderburg Disaster I cite these ones as examples of both the heavy impact of accidents, which tend be very unpredictable in advance but are often seen as very obvious in hindsight, albeit sometimes just because folks need a scapegoat, and also because of how they initiated a great deal of public distrust in the relevant technology or industry. 

**[00:04:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h04m12s)**  These accidents arguably had a disproportionate response from the public in terms of their confidence in that technology. 

**[00:04:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h04m20s)**  These do not have to bad though, many of them are good things and indeed almost every memorable technological advancement is a black swan. 

**[00:04:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h04m27s)**  The Invention of the Transistor, the personal computer, the internet, and cell phones are each often deemed black swans with obvious results, though I question how unpredictable any of those but the transistor was. 

**[00:04:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h04m40s)**  The printing press, which allowed mass production of cheap books, probably did more to fuel the rise of modern science and technology than any other invention or scientific theory, by making knowledge so easy to access. 

**[00:04:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h04m53s)**  Those effects were quite unpredictable though both the result, and the device itself, are incredibly obvious and simple. 

**[00:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h05m00s)**  In many respects it is not the invention itself, or the accident, which interests us but rather the unexpected effects. 

**[00:05:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h05m07s)**  We will give more of those in a bit, but another old example would be the horse-collar, a device invented quite a long time before it arrived in Europe but that on doing so created a massive food surplus which both allowed more people and allowed more of them to pick specialist professions rather than farming. 

**[00:05:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h05m23s)**  It would be very reductionist to say that the rise of Europe to near global dominance in centuries that followed was principally the result of the printing press or horse collar but a strong argument could be made that it would not have occurred without both of those and hard to argue that they were not major contributors to that. 

**[00:05:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h05m41s)**  Interestingly it is just that rise which leads into our main example of next concept, via the Conquistadors, the arguably more extreme form of Black Swan Event called an Outside Context Problem. 

**[00:05:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h05m52s)**  An Outside Context Problem, an OCP, is a good deal different than a Black Swan but more in terms of degree. 

**[00:05:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h05m59s)**  We get this term from Iain M. Banks’ 1996 scifi novel Excession, published a decade before Black Swan, where it is commented on as follows: "An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilizations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop.” “The usual example given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was imagining you were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you’d tamed the land, invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbors were cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had, you were in a position of near-absolute power and control which your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass… when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks come ashore and announce you’ve just been discovered, you’re all subjects of the Emperor now, he’s keen on presents called taxes and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests.” Now such a thing occurring to us would not be an Outside Context Problem, we would certainly be surprised if an alien ship arrived in orbit tomorrow but we certainly have a context for it. 

**[00:07:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h07m16s)**  We have for generations now, it has been the subject of countless films, shows, and novels and we will also have it as a subject next month. 

**[00:07:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h07m25s)**  In this respect the OCP is essentially a very extreme black swan, and I should note that neither has to be a bad thing, they can be excellent things overall, like the internet. 

**[00:07:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h07m35s)**  They can also be entirely natural. 

**[00:07:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h07m36s)**  I would not call an asteroid impact on Earth today an OCP, but it would probably be a Black Swan. 

**[00:07:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h07m43s)**  Asteroid impacts are hardly unpredictable, in fact we are very good at estimating their frequency these days. 

**[00:07:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h07m49s)**  By looking at our own history and craters on the moon we learned a lot. 

**[00:07:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h07m53s)**  Loosely speaking the diameter of crater on the moon is inverse cube to the frequency of craters of that size. 

**[00:08:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m00s)**  There are 8 times as many 5 meter wide craters as 10 meter wide craters and 8 times as many of those as 20 meter wide ones. 

**[00:08:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m08s)**  For every hundred meter crater there are thousand ten meter wide craters as those are one tenth the diameter and ten cubed is a thousand. 

**[00:08:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m16s)**  So from this we know that kilometer wide asteroids hit the Earth about twice in a million year period. 

**[00:08:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m21s)**  They don’t hit every 500,000 years though, you could go several millions year without one then have a few hit in a period of a just a few thousand years. 

**[00:08:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m29s)**  One is as likely to hit next week as in any other week, and the odds are about 1 in 25 million that it should do so. 

**[00:08:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m37s)**  Needless to say next week’s episode will be probably be delayed should that occur. 

**[00:08:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m41s)**  Also, needless to say, such an event would have a big impact on our civilization, in a very literal sense. 

**[00:08:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m47s)**  It’s hard to think of true OCP because they have to be the sort of thing you never would expect, so the rise of a Computer Super-Intelligence would not qualify. 

**[00:08:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h08m56s)**  The example of the Mule from Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, the telepathic mutant who disrupted the predictive powers of psychohistory in that story, would be an OCP I think. 

**[00:09:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h09m07s)**  Amusingly I do not think either aliens or computer super-intelligence would qualify because scientists and risk managers consider those quite possible, whereas telepathic powers are considered possible by much of the population but are not the sort of thing you’d expect to see governments having contingency plans for. 

**[00:09:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h09m23s)**  Ghost, angels, or demons would similarly qualify, I don’t know if most people believe in all three but many do believe in one or more. 

**[00:09:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h09m30s)**  I wouldn’t be surprised if governments had contingency plans on the shelves to deal with the arrival of an alien spaceship but I would be surprised if they had one for a portal to the pits of Hell to open up and demons to come spewing forth or the four horsemen to come riding into town. 

**[00:09:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h09m44s)**  Now there is an obvious reason why we do not have contingency plans for such things and would be shocked by them, a lot of us would consider it impossible and those who didn’t have a simple plan in mind, take a knee and start praying. 

**[00:09:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h09m56s)**  But that is kind of the point of an OCP, it is something you just cannot anticipate and have no context for handling, like the Sun not rising tomorrow, or gravity shutting off, or the Voyager Probe sending back an image of a crystal sphere before smashing against it. 

**[00:10:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h10m12s)**  It would be pretty mind-bending after centuries of adapting ourselves to the notion that we are in a tiny corner of the Universe to find out we lived inside a giant television faking the stars and that whoever made it had never even expected us to interpret modern astronomy out of it but comes down for an interview to tell us how impressive and fascinating they thought our crazy complex and elaborate theories of cosmology were from what was actually random moving dots. 

**[00:10:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h10m35s)**  Or if we managed to zoom down one more level beneath quarks and saw something that looked suspiciously like galactic superclusters and voids. 

**[00:10:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h10m43s)**  Stuff like that would probably give me an aneurysm and I’d be in existential shock for weeks as would most scientists I’d think. 

**[00:10:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h10m50s)**  It wouldn’t even necessarily have to be something we think is impossible or had an intelligent agency connected to it. 

**[00:10:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h10m56s)**  Getting invaded by an Alternate Reality Earth or have an incident where an ejected black hole wandered into our solar system to enter a death spiral with the sun would qualify. 

**[00:11:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h11m05s)**  There’s another OCP I imagine, portals opening up and armies from a parallel Earth pouring through to conquer us. 

**[00:11:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h11m12s)**  Again a lot of these sound absurd but for it to be a genuine OCP it almost has to. 

**[00:11:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h11m17s)**  Godzilla is not going to come storming out of the ocean to terrorize Japan and the graveyards are not going to erupt with undead and spew forth the Zombie Apocalypse but an OCP that can happen is the sort of thing you would react to in a similar way if someone suggested it. 

**[00:11:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h11m33s)**  I simply have no context for the idea that all of a sudden a nearby mountain is going to open up a giant eyelid, look down at where we’ve drilled a tunnel through it for a freeway, and standup to demand who the heck we are, how so many of us got here while it was taking its brief million year nap, and where we get off cutting holes in him. 

**[00:11:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h11m51s)**  So that is an OCP, again it is pretty extreme form of black swan, and also predates the concept by a decade. 

**[00:11:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h11m59s)**  Though of course we have long had a concept for both. 

**[00:12:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h12m03s)**  Unpredictable events, or at least unpredicted events, which play a pivotal role in history, not a terribly new concept in and of itself. 

**[00:12:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h12m11s)**  Now let’s go ahead and play the prediction game ourselves and try to look at some technologies, ones we’ve discussed before, and consider some of the less obvious ways it might impact civilization. 

**[00:12:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h12m22s)**  Just to illustrate how stuff can sneak up on you. 

**[00:12:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h12m24s)**  For instance we talk a lot on the channel about fusion, the impact of fusion on our society was the subject of one of the earliest episodes, and a point I focused on there was that it wasn’t just cheap electricity. 

**[00:12:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h12m36s)**  In fact your electric bill would not drop too much since much of it is not the price of fossil fuels or uranium but rather the maintenance of the plant and electrical lines. 

**[00:12:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h12m46s)**  The cost of fuel is a big factor in electrical costs but dropping that to zero will not make your electrical bill drop to a tiny fraction of what it was before because you are not paying for electricity, you are paying for electricity to be reliably transported to your home. 

**[00:13:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h13m01s)**  So even if we’re churning out gigawatts of power for peanuts, we still have to pay the same to maintain the grid, which is no trivial expense. 

**[00:13:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h13m09s)**  It shifts the game though so that you are essentially paying for access to power, not quantity of it, much like your classic telephone connection where you paid the same whether you used it almost all day or maybe just for a few minutes one or twice a week. 

**[00:13:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h13m24s)**  Rather we saw the impact in a lot of secondary areas where the actual cost of electricity was a major limiting factor. 

**[00:13:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h13m31s)**  Suddenly the desalinization of water becomes cheap enough to use for bulk agriculture, the price of aluminum, which is most electricity, tumbles down to be competitive with steel, and indeed the price of fossil fuels plummets because you no longer have to worry about its scarcity or environmental impact as you have the energy to pay to suck carbon and water out of the air and recombine it into hydrocarbons. 

**[00:13:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h13m53s)**  A process that we can do now quite easily but which takes more energy to do than would be released when you burn them. 

**[00:14:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h14m00s)**  A pointless and self-defeating strategy when those fuels are your primary power source but not when you wish to use them essentially as batteries, running things which cannot easily be plugged into the grid. 

**[00:14:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h14m12s)**  These are examples of secondary effects of technologies that tend to get overlooked in discussing them and part of how they become black swans. 

**[00:14:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h14m20s)**  Many nations or places which are big oil producers tend to be either deserts or tundras, their economies on first glance would be obliterated by the end of fossil fuels but that same end opens the door to another form of wealth because now you can get away with heated greenhouses in the tundra and mass irrigation via seawater that has had the salt removed from it, those are secondary economic effects of commercial fusion. 

**[00:14:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h14m46s)**  You could either have a total meltdown of the economy and society in big oil producers like that, or a sudden boom as Saudi Arabia becomes a major exporter of grains. 

**[00:14:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h14m56s)**  A Tertiary effect would be that it would be a booming business turning out the aluminum and glass frames to make those tundra greenhouses, or the geo engineering industry where you will have to come up with strategies to minimize runoff from dumping trillions of liters of water onto deserts. 

**[00:15:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h15m11s)**  Obviously being able to see the possible options is best, but sometimes you cannot, which raises the idea of being robust against the unpredictable. 

**[00:15:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h15m20s)**  Typically by diversification of assets and industries when we’re talking economic unpredictability. 

**[00:15:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h15m26s)**  But the same applies to warfare for instance, and to evolution itself. 

**[00:15:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h15m30s)**  This is one of the reasons why diversity is highly valuable, even if a given option seems flat out better than the other alternatives. 

**[00:15:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h15m36s)**  The purpose of competition is often not to produce a single winner, but to produce several, each sharpened to their specific specialty. 

**[00:15:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h15m46s)**  We do not want every athlete to compete to be a marathon champion, we need them to be spread out to many games and as a society we are most robust when we are built for decathlons. 

**[00:15:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h15m57s)**  This is how you prepare for when predictions do fall short, which they often do because of those secondary and tertiary effects, many of which are quite predictable even in foresight, and many of which are not, that tend to both take us off guard and result in the next over-night billionaire or boomtown. 

**[00:16:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h16m14s)**  Many people did predict computers and cellphones and the internet and online purchases decently before they became regular household features. 

**[00:16:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h16m22s)**  I don’t remember anyone predicting things like Google for search engines, Microsoft for Operating Systems, or Facebook for Social media, not as these giant companies whose owners often have more wealth than some small nations. 

**[00:16:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h16m37s)**  Just for fun let’s consider a few others we can partially predict for the next few generations. 

**[00:16:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h16m42s)**  We contemplate space elevators as a very easy way to get into space, we forget that a minor modification and addition to them allows hyper-fast transit around the planet’s surface too. 

**[00:16:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h16m53s)**  We consider face recognition software as a handy way to tag people in photos on facebook, and we can see its value in law enforcement, and we worry about how it damages privacy, yet that same technology could allow the automatic removal of anyone from an image, either by not allowing that image or video to be uploaded without their permission or blurring them out of it. 

**[00:17:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h17m15s)**  We consider how nice it would be to have cameras on us recording things so we can relive them years later, but ignore that same recognition software could be used to rapidly scans your recording for where you last left your car keys or the meal you had at a restaurant that you really enjoyed the last time you were there so you can recall what it is to order it, or so that the software can analyze the image and tell you what the calorie content is, or analyze your entire last year of eating and tell you how many calories you had. 

**[00:17:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h17m44s)**  Or index and itemize every receipt you were handed. 

**[00:17:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h17m48s)**  Forget that you can order groceries to be delivered fifteen minutes later by drone if you are missing the key piece of a recipe, what about the app that analyzes every food item you have in your house right now by scanning the video of your memory or internal house cameras and tell you what meals you have enjoyed before that you can make out of the available contents. 

**[00:18:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h18m08s)**  Or can do one better and cross-match that against what you have eaten recently to highlight the ones with rights calories and nutrients for your next meal. 

**[00:18:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h18m16s)**  How about an app that let’s everyone in the room permit it access to their recording of pizza and quickly scans through for shared mutual toppings everyone enjoys. 

**[00:18:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h18m25s)**  Clothing displays that can render a quick photorealistic image of you wearing that item of clothing, ads which do the same but show you using that product, the billboard along the road that can recognize the ten people about to pass it and analyze for the optimum product to display based on those ten people. 

**[00:18:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h18m42s)**  The TV in the elevator that is smart enough to start playing ads for deodorant and breath mints when it gets overloaded and stuck. 

**[00:18:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h18m50s)**  These are the kind of things I personally would predict we would see rolling out in the next decade or two. 

**[00:18:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h18m56s)**  Not just labor saving devices like a robot that can mow your lawn for you but tedium-saving devices that can do your paperwork for you and anticipatory devices that monitor you, notice you’re a little sleepy and ask if you want a cup of coffee. 

**[00:19:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h19m10s)**  The phone that knows you are asleep or in a meeting and will only ring for emergencies as you’ve previously defined them. 

**[00:19:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h19m16s)**  Not the sign at the library telling you to mute your phone but the signal in the library that tells those phones only to ring for emergencies, and which you can tell to ignore such suggestions. 

**[00:19:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h19m26s)**  Are things like that Black Swans? 

**[00:19:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h19m29s)**  Some probably are, because while we call cell phones black swans, when in fact they were entirely predicted, what we didn’t predict is the change to culture norms and behaviors that accompanied them. 

**[00:19:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h19m41s)**  Our interest today is not in making predictions, there are plenty of those out there and I’ve never considered myself much more accurate at making them than you would get just using tea leaves or a Ouija Board. 

**[00:19:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h19m52s)**  Partially we are trying to emphasize just how hard it is to foresee a lot of this stuff and why we shouldn’t trust a lot of the predictions we often see in futurism because often our sense of logic blinds us. 

**[00:20:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h20m02s)**  It is very easy to just say ‘of course X will happen’ and get a bit myopic about the future. 

**[00:20:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h20m09s)**  This channel is not and never really has been about making predictions about the future, we tend to focus more on examining common staples of futurism and science fiction and asking if they actually make much sense on inspection, or if the concept might be resting on an assumption that is fundamentally flawed and kills the entire concept. 

**[00:20:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h20m28s)**  To make your civilization robust against the sort of disruptions even positive black swans can bring, you have be constantly questioning your basic assumptions about future predictions. 

**[00:20:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h20m39s)**  We see this a lot when discussing space colonization, how the assumption of having faster than light travel one day or settling people onto other planets tends to blind us to the much more probable path into the future that we will tend to build our habitats, not tweak existing ones. 

**[00:20:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h20m56s)**  We don’t go hunting for new caves to live in and then spruce them up to be nicer, we build caves where we want them instead. 

**[00:21:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h21m04s)**  We also see it a lot with the Fermi Paradox when people try to explain away the Great Silence in terms of their preconceptions of how aliens ought to behave, and that’s something we will be looking at more next year, alien civilizations. 

**[00:21:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h21m17s)**  Not so much how they will behave, because we cannot predict that much, but rather what we can say about how they would not behave. 

**[00:21:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h21m24s)**  That will feed into our first two topics for next year, the major black swan and possible full blown OCP of a first contact situation with an alien civilization. 

**[00:21:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h21m35s)**  We will get to that in two weeks, but first, for next week, we are going to go through and look at a lot of common themes we see in discussion of alien civilizations and ask ourselves if those actually make much sense or could be viewed as misconceptions or even just flat out silly. 

**[00:21:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h21m52s)**  Like the notion that aliens would want to enslave humans or eat us. 

**[00:21:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h21m56s)**  Or many others that just don’t make sense at all and imply the aliens are just flat out stupid. 

**[00:22:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h22m01s)**  We will try to clear away some of the science fiction clutter about that so that we can go on the next week to ask ourselves about a First Contact Situation, and then throughout the next year we will visit the topic of possible alien civilizations some more. 

**[00:22:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h22m15s)**  That will close us out for this year though, Year 2, which has been an interesting one. 

**[00:22:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h22m20s)**  The channel went from being a small one with about a thousand subscribers and about a dozen episodes made every other month or so to one with about 30,000 subscribers and weekly episodes. 

**[00:22:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h22m31s)**  The first video of 2016, Moon Base Concepts, didn’t even come out till February but the next video at the end of the month began our weekly cycle, and I never thought I’d be able to keep up that rate of production but now it feels pretty natural and the quality had continued to rise. 

**[00:22:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h22m47s)**  A lot of that is thanks to the channels supporters on Patreon, whose generous donations have helped to keep the channel going and improving. 

**[00:22:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h22m53s)**  I can’t properly express my gratitude to those folks enough and if you’d like to join them, there’s a link to the channel’s Patreon account in the episode description, and you can also donate via the Channel’s website. 

**[00:23:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h23m05s)**  Speaking of that website, I want to thank Luis, or webmaster, for all the time he’s volunteered creating and maintaining that. 

**[00:23:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h23m12s)**  Also Jakub Grygier, who creates all the excellent cover art and thumbnails for the channel, and the mods and admins over at the Channel’s Facebook and Reddit groups, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, and also the members there who have been helping me come up with topics and often helping me edit the scripts themselves. 

**[00:23:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h23m29s)**  At the beginning of the year this was entirely a one-man show, and it definitely shows in the quality, and hopefully that quality will keep rising in year 3. 

**[00:23:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h23m38s)**  So next week will be Stupid Aliens, followed by First Contact, don’t forget to subscribe to the channel for alerts when those and other episodes come out, and if you enjoyed the episode, please like it and share it with others. 

**[00:23:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AHvLuhjfAyA&t=00h23m51s)**  Until next time, Thanks for watching, have a great day, and have a great year!
