So today’s video is on Interstellar Colonization, and it’s been a year-long trip getting here as we covered other subjects to build up to this. 

**[00:00:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h00m22s)**  This seems kind of appropriate since as we’ll see today Interstellar Colonization is a process that involves a lot of year-long trips. 

**[00:00:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h00m30s)**  Around a year ago when this channel was very new we discussed a concept called the Dyson Dilemma. 

**[00:00:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h00m36s)**  In a nutshell it assumes that technological civilizations will be prone to expand and that if they do so we should be unable to miss that expansion even galaxies away. 

**[00:00:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h00m47s)**  You don’t need to have seen that, or any of the other videos, before watching this but there’s some tied together material and I will occasionally reference it. 

**[00:00:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h00m56s)**  It matters today only because we’ll be talking about how technological civilizations can expand. 

**[00:01:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h01m01s)**  The ins and outs of that are a long subject and we had to lay a lot of groundwork to get here today to discuss it. 

**[00:01:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h01m08s)**  Future videos will be able to be a lot more self-contained but this one, as mentioned, is a bit of final chapter to our first year so catching those other videos might be helpful if not absolutely necessary. 

**[00:01:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h01m20s)**  Usually when I’m referencing one of those prior videos you’ll see a thumbnail picture pop up in a white or yellow box, clicking on those will pause this video and open that video up in a new window. 

**[00:01:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h01m31s)**  I try to make these videos as self-contained as possible so first time watchers aren’t getting left behind. 

**[00:01:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h01m37s)**  This isn’t supposed to be book ten of some series where if you haven’t read the prior ones you have no idea what’s going on, but I also don’t want to lengthen this already lengthy video rehashing material we’ve already covered. 

**[00:01:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h01m49s)**  So if you’re new here and feel yourself losing traction on a subject you might want to watch the suggested videos and come back to this one. 

**[00:01:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h01m57s)**  Also if you’re new to this channel by now you’d have noticed a speech impediment, to help with that these videos always include closed captions you can turn on with the transcript of the video. 

**[00:02:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h02m07s)**  So intro complete, let’s get to what is essentially the epilogue of this channel’s first year. 

**[00:02:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h02m12s)**  And we’ll do that with a bit of prologue to the notion of interstellar travel. 

**[00:02:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h02m16s)**  Prior to the last couple centuries, with some noticeable exceptions, planets around other stars wasn’t given much consideration, let alone travel to them. 

**[00:02:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h02m26s)**  During the 19th century the idea that our planet might be truly ancient, millions or even billions of years old, was beginning to settle into public awareness. 

**[00:02:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h02m37s)**  At the same time the idea that the Universe was itself almost inconceivably old and huge and full of stars that might host equally ancient planets. 

**[00:02:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h02m45s)**  Even our word for this, extraterrestrial, references terrestrial, our Earth, because most early notions of aliens reference other planets in our own solar system like Mars and Martians, as seen in H.G. Wells War of the Worlds or Edgar Rice Burrough’s Barsoom Series. 

**[00:03:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h03m02s)**  We didn’t say Extra-Solarian, meaning outside our solar system, we said extra-terrestrial, meaning not from Earth and this wasn’t an accident. 

**[00:03:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h03m10s)**  We just weren’t seriously considering traveling between stars and there being worlds like our own around them. 

**[00:03:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h03m17s)**  Early science fiction on this emerged quite slowly and often didn’t do well with audiences. 

**[00:03:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h03m22s)**  H.P. 

**[00:03:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h03m23s)**  Lovecraft, famous sci-fi horror writer today, a century after he started writing, never caught on in his own time and probably because his work centers so much around the existential dread associated to contemplating just how old and huge our Universe is. 

**[00:03:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h03m38s)**  This concept, that humanity occupied a tiny chunk of the Universe for an eyeblink of time, hadn’t really got its claws into our collective awareness yet. 

**[00:03:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h03m47s)**  Not the first to deal with the concepts, but probably the one who most inspired others to think and write about them was Olaf Stapledon, who writing in the 1930s about long term civilizations, aliens, megaengineering, genetic engineering, and terraforming proceeded to open the doors of the imagination for many others. 

**[00:04:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h04m06s)**  Immediately after that we saw an explosion in science fiction as a genre, the oft-called golden age of science fiction, in the late 30s and 40s when this stuff started really getting traction on people’s minds and with the Space Race of the late 50s and 60s it has stayed there. 

**[00:04:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h04m20s)**  A generation after science fiction began popularizing the notion of alien planets we landed men on our own moon and landed probes on Mars shortly thereafter. 

**[00:04:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h04m30s)**  Unfortunately that’s where it stayed, because our Moon is around a hundred times closer than other planets, and while we could send people to Mars and could have for some decades the cost and risks of associated to doing that have remained a bit too high for anyone to authorize what would by and large amount to a very expensive photo op. 

**[00:04:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h04m50s)**  Similarly a permanent moon base hasn’t happened yet either. 

**[00:04:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h04m54s)**  And the moon, the furthest place any human has traveled, a mere couple of light seconds from home, is nearly a hundred million times closer than the nearest stars. 

**[00:05:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h05m03s)**  For comparison, if Earth was on the palm of your hand and the moon was sitting on the tip of your finger, Mars would be in your neighbor’s yard and our nearest neighboring star would be on a different continent. 

**[00:05:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h05m16s)**  So to seriously contemplate interstellar travel we have to have a way to get there and on a timeline people can survive. 

**[00:05:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h05m24s)**  Over the years we’ve spent a lot of a time contemplating these and so let’s review some of the one’s a bit more grounded in current science. 

**[00:05:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h05m30s)**  Wormholes and faster than light travel would be nice, and we’ll look at those concepts in the future, but today we’ll assume we haven’t got them other than to note that if you do have them not much changes other than that things get much easier. 

**[00:05:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h05m45s)**  We can skip chemical rockets. 

**[00:05:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h05m47s)**  Traditional rockets just can’t deliver a big enough payload to any speed that would get you to another star in less time than human civilization has already existed. 

**[00:05:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h05m55s)**  That leaves us two options, a better rocket fuel or not using rocket fuel at all. 

**[00:06:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h06m00s)**  Do we have a better rocket fuel? 

**[00:06:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h06m04s)**  Yes. 

**[00:06:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h06m05s)**  Even before we landed on the moon we were already considering how to use Nuclear Power for propulsion, some of the popular efforts being Project Orion, Project Daedelus, and Project Longshot. 

**[00:06:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h06m16s)**  In a nutshell, though each design is different, the loose concept is to explode nuclear bombs behind a ship in series and let the explosions keep pushing the ship to higher and higher speeds, then at the end of the trip to flip over and shoot off nukes in front of you to slow down. 

**[00:06:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h06m34s)**  That sounds incredibly unsafe but rocketry always involves terrifyingly huge explosions so this is just scaling up a bit. 

**[00:06:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h06m42s)**  They also scale up a lot in size, since the big issue is that you can’t really make very small nuclear bombs especially not ones that are particularly energy efficient. 

**[00:06:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h06m52s)**  Loosely speaking a complete bomb, including conventional explosives, fissile material, and fusionable material in H-bombs, pack more punch per pound the bigger they are. 

**[00:07:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h07m01s)**  So you might as well go with a big space ship since you can only absorb so much of the blast with a smaller one. 

**[00:07:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h07m07s)**  These nuclear ship designs gave us our first hint that we could get to other stars because they can send very large ships through space at around ten percent of light speed ideally, and you can do a bit better if you’ve got actual fusion like we discussed in the video on that. 

**[00:07:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h07m22s)**  They also presumably have nuclear power plants on board to handle life support for crews. 

**[00:07:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h07m27s)**  Of course ten percent of light speed still means the nearest stars are decades of travel away. 

**[00:07:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h07m32s)**  There’s some hypothetical ways of going faster we’ll get to but first let’s consider those early ship designs. 

**[00:07:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h07m38s)**  If the trip is going to take decades, or centuries, to get to another star but can have very large payloads we can get people there. 

**[00:07:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h07m48s)**  Except most will have died of old age by then. 

**[00:07:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h07m50s)**  There’s been several approaches to this and I’m going to borrow a classification system by Steve Bowers, a friend of mine whose space artwork you’ve seen a lot of especially on this channel. 

**[00:08:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h08m00s)**  Steve breaks the ships, these arks, into five categories. 

**[00:08:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h08m05s)**  The first are Methuselah ships, named for the ancient biblical patriarch who lived longest in the Bible’s chronology so you can guess why we call these ships this. 

**[00:08:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h08m14s)**  These ships assume the crew is conscious the whole trip and simply live the whole journey because people age slower or not at all. 

**[00:08:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h08m22s)**  We’ve not really discussed biological immortality or transhumanism much on this channel but suffice it to say the notion of people living a lot longer is viewed by many in the sciences as not only doable, but quite probably a lot sooner on the horizon than regular manned interplanetary travel let alone interstellar travel so it’s not that far out there. 

**[00:08:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h08m43s)**  Unlike faster-than-light travel it doesn’t violate or seriously bend any known laws of science either. 

**[00:08:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h08m50s)**  The big problem with Methuselah ships is usually seen as boredom, even on a big ark ship able to hold a couple hundred people living on recycled air and water and hydroponically grown food powered by fission or fusion you’re going to get pretty bored as the years roll by. 

**[00:09:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h09m07s)**  Now there’s no real maximum size on such ships, except that if you double your population you presumably need to double all your fuel and supplies, so you could send many thousands of people instead. 

**[00:09:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h09m18s)**  As to boredom, well we get a lot of our entertainment digitally these days so it’s not like they’d be limited to carry a small library of films or books, and they’d keep receiving new stuff from home, even if it was increasingly delayed. 

**[00:09:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h09m30s)**  So I don’t think boredom is a project-killer but it probably would be hard to keep enthusiasm going for centuries. 

**[00:09:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h09m38s)**  This gets us into the second and better known version, Hibernation Ships, often called Sleeper Ships. 

**[00:09:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h09m44s)**  We freeze you and wake you up later. 

**[00:09:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h09m46s)**  Either running the ship automatically or with a small crew being thawed for short shifts before being re-frozen. 

**[00:09:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h09m53s)**  This might be pretty attractive even if you were functionally immortal and it’s certainly a concept we’ve seen a lot of in fiction. 

**[00:10:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h10m01s)**  We still don’t have cryogenics or cryonics, in a way that lets us freeze people and bring them back yet. 

**[00:10:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h10m08s)**  A lot of people gamble we’ll figure out the ‘bring you back’ option eventually and get frozen even today, it’s not just Walt Disney, and it doesn’t actually cost much more than a sports car and is fairly comparable a lot of treatment processes for nastier ailments. 

**[00:10:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h10m22s)**  Heck even traditional burials can be pretty pricy, so as prospects look better and cost come down it might get to be as common as burial or cremation. 

**[00:10:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h10m30s)**  It might get pretty common even in a biologically immortal society as people might opt to bounce forward to more interesting times. 

**[00:10:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h10m38s)**  I can easily see modern day equivalents to the pyramids just stuffed full of frozen bodies to maximize security and minimize costs. 

**[00:10:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h10m46s)**  Sleeper Ship and Hibernation ship being kind of inaccurate, since you are definitely dead, not asleep, make me think pyramids aren’t a half bad comparison since they amount to giant crypts like the pyramids were. 

**[00:10:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h10m58s)**  This area, in regard to spaceships, doesn’t require much consideration except the concern over whether or not you’d even want a conscious crew. 

**[00:11:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h11m07s)**  Usually we figure on small team being awake just in case the automation fails but when you consider it, with decent automation, odds are probably lower of that automation screwing up by some internal failure or external variable then of a conscious crew member going ax-crazy and murdering everyone. 

**[00:11:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h11m23s)**  You wouldn’t send off a sleeper ships unless you’d gold-plated your automation so the risk of someone going nuts probably would exceed the odds of a failure. 

**[00:11:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h11m33s)**  If you haven’t got immortality or cryonics you can do the next category, Generation Ships. 

**[00:11:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h11m38s)**  Here it isn’t people leaving Earth to land on an alien world, but rather their descendants doing so. 

**[00:11:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h11m44s)**  The crew lives, eats, breathes, and breeds their whole life on a ship. 

**[00:11:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h11m50s)**  Inside you simulate a decent living environment by having a rotating section, as we discussed in heavy detail in the Rotating Habitats video. 

**[00:11:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h11m58s)**  Now classically people figure you need a big population for this so you don’t get inbreeding and genetic bottlenecking, and the same for your eventual colony, but while we can’t freeze and thaw people yet we can freeze and thaw sperm and eggs and implant them into people. 

**[00:12:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h12m14s)**  We do this a lot already. 

**[00:12:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h12m16s)**  And while there is a half-life on such things, they can’t currently be stored indefinitely, we also have DNA printing, where we can take a digital record of a piece of DNA and print it into a real strand of DNA which can then be implanted into an egg. 

**[00:12:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h12m31s)**  Digital files not only keep longer, and can be redundantly backed up, but can be transmitted at light speed. 

**[00:12:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h12m37s)**  So colonization issues worrying about genetic bottlenecking can be brushed aside with existing technology. 

**[00:12:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h12m44s)**  So an Arkship of the generational variety probably just needs enough people to maintain a decently sane society, not a genepool, and as hunter-gatherers in origin we already have a concept for a tribe. 

**[00:12:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h12m56s)**  Also a concept called Dunbar’s number, about 160, that contemplates the idea of active social structures. 

**[00:13:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h13m03s)**  Dunbar’s number is a pretty popular figure to be used when discussing decently long-lasting but stable micro-civilizations because its small enough you can know everyone but large enough that you can have a wide selection of not just skill specializations but also of social options. 

**[00:13:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h13m19s)**  Lots of selections for friends and romance and big enough that you can avoid people who you absolutely hate. 

**[00:13:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h13m25s)**  And again you don’t have to worry about every potential partner being your cousin since you’ve got all that frozen or digitally stored genetic material to avoid the problem. 

**[00:13:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h13m34s)**  The idea of freezing or printing genetic data, along with heavily automated Hibernation Ships brings us to our next type, which are Seed Ships. 

**[00:13:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h13m44s)**  These are seen as the solution for when you don’t want to use a lot of mass and fuel for each trip. 

**[00:13:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h13m49s)**  You send a very small ship that’s heavily automated, able to replicate machinery via 3D printing and such, and could for instance print an artificial womb. 

**[00:13:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h13m58s)**  Seed ships arrive at their destination and seed the place. 

**[00:14:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h14m02s)**  Automated terraforming including with plants and animals, and maybe even people. 

**[00:14:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h14m08s)**  Classically you’d often send a seed ship ahead of a generation ship or hibernation ship so that the planet was part way ready when people arrived, since the seed ship could travel faster, but if you’ve got really good artificial wombs and automated child care and teaching programs you could grow your colonists there. 

**[00:14:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h14m26s)**  The idea of children born in tanks from frozen or printed genetic material and raised by machines is pretty disturbing at first but we really have no way of knowing that this would result in total failure or a bunch of maladjusted antisocial lunatics. 

**[00:14:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h14m44s)**  It just depends on how good your artificial intelligence is and if it’s as smart as a human it probably can raise a totally normal healthy kid, there’s no reason it couldn’t simulate normal human emotions or that they’d even be simulations. 

**[00:14:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h14m57s)**  This option doesn’t tend to be appealing to many people though. 

**[00:15:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h15m01s)**  Partially because if you’ve got Artificial Intelligence that good, and automation that good, it makes some wonder why you’d send people at all, or humans anyway. 

**[00:15:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h15m11s)**  And that’s category five, Dataships, or basically very small ships with huge data packets that arrive at the destination and unpack themselves using local material. 

**[00:15:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h15m21s)**  Up to and including unpacking people since it’s often assumed you could store human minds digitally and just upload them into cloned or cybernetic bodies built on the spot. 

**[00:15:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h15m30s)**  These can presumably be very small and fast, potentially storing billons of minds on something no bigger than a soda bottle. 

**[00:15:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h15m37s)**  These are often seen as a type of seed ship or hibernation ship themselves, and it should be noted that if you’ve gone all digital with people’s mind you can do light speed travel by just sending the data once a receiver has arrived. 

**[00:15:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h15m50s)**  Needless to say this concept is very popular with fans of mind uploading and singularity but not so much with anyone who isn’t. 

**[00:15:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h15m59s)**  So that’s our five types of ships, and they can all get the job done if you’ve got the right technology to run them. 

**[00:16:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h16m05s)**  Right now we’ve got the technology to build a nuclear ship and run a generational ark, though actually paying to build one is beyond us right now and colonizing a planet is too. 

**[00:16:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h16m16s)**  Colonizing is the big thing, but before jumping into that I want to give quick overview of some other propulsion systems that we’ll look at more in the future. 

**[00:16:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h16m24s)**  I already touched on Fusion Drive, or Fusion Torch Ships, in the Fusion video, they’re basically nuclear powered ships that can go decently faster and let you have more cargo and don’t require nearly depleting our supply of fissionable materials like uranium just to launch one ship. 

**[00:16:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h16m39s)**  They still have a limited fuel supply though and you need to use a lot not just to speed up but also to slow back down again. 

**[00:16:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h16m48s)**  One version of this you might have heard of is called a Bussard Ramjet and it gets around the fuel issue by sucking in gases floating around space as fuel or propellant. 

**[00:16:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h16m57s)**  It’s the basis of the ship that was the central theme for the sci-fi classic Tau Zero. 

**[00:17:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h17m02s)**  Unfortunately it doesn’t look like this is going to be feasible since you’d probably lose more speed and energy pulling the matter in then you’d get out of it but we haven’t ruled it out entirely just yet. 

**[00:17:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h17m13s)**  This is still seen as the most probable means for ships that don’t need fueling and can get up to arbitrarily high speeds or at least to fractions of the speed of light where you might not need to worry about how your crew spends the travel time because special relativity kicks in to seriously shorten it. 

**[00:17:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h17m28s)**  However, its apparent tendency to use more energy than it produces, thus actually slowing the ship down instead of speeding it up, would still make it useful. 

**[00:17:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h17m36s)**  Ships don’t just need fuel to speed up, they need it to slow back down again, I would say they need the same amount except that you really do need more to speed up since part of what you’re speeding up is the fuel you need to slow down again. 

**[00:17:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h17m49s)**  If you can use a Bussard Ramjet, or similar device, to slow a ship down you don’t just save your slow down fuel, you get all the fuel back, or cargo space back, that you’d have had to use to store that slow-down fuel since you can decelerate using fuel you didn’t have to bring from home. 

**[00:18:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m05s)**  And there’s a few other ways you can probably do this too we’ll look at another time. 

**[00:18:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m09s)**  Bussard Ramjet’s aren’t the only way to get near light speed without coming up with some new science though. 

**[00:18:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m15s)**  Another is using antimatter instead of fission or fusion. 

**[00:18:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m19s)**  With antimatter you get total mass to energy conversion, that whole E=MC-squared thingy, and that lets you get way higher speeds. 

**[00:18:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m27s)**  Project Valkyrie, a design for an antimatter powered ship, can get up to a very good percentage of the speed of light. 

**[00:18:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m34s)**  Of course we have the big issue that we can’t manufacture antimatter in large quantities. 

**[00:18:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m38s)**  That we use millions of times more energy to make antimatter than is in that antimatter, and that we have only some basic notions for how to store the stuff safely. 

**[00:18:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m48s)**  On a similar scale we have black-hole powered ships, which aren’t quite as good as antimatter in truth but are pretty neat ideas we’ll look at another time. 

**[00:18:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h18m57s)**  Summary form you use small artificial blackholes that are evaporating and giving off Hawking Radiation as your propellant, letting that radiation push your ship. 

**[00:19:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m07s)**  The other side of the house is stuff that carries no fuel, or no more than is needed for running life support and doing some maneuvering. 

**[00:19:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m14s)**  Rockets aren’t the only way to push things along, nor is slapping them from behind with a nuclear detonation. 

**[00:19:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m19s)**  If you’ve ever seen a light mill, a Crookes Radiometer, then you know the concept. 

**[00:19:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m24s)**  Take a fan setup in a vacuum painted white on one side and black on the other and it will spin like a water wheel as light bounces off the white side and gets absorbed by the dark side. 

**[00:19:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m33s)**  Light has momentum and if it gets absorbed by something it passes that momentum to the object. 

**[00:19:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m39s)**  If it gets reflected away it passes even more momentum. 

**[00:19:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m41s)**  It’s not a lot of momentum but this is the basic concept of a light sail, also called a photon sail or more commonly a solar sail. 

**[00:19:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m50s)**  Solar sails aren’t great for interstellar travel because the further you get from the sun the weaker your push. 

**[00:19:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h19m56s)**  New materials like graphene, than can in theory be made so thin you could sit on a stack a billion sheets thick before your feet started dangling, make this more attractive than materials like gold or aluminum which can’t be made nearly as thin and still be reflective and hold together. 

**[00:20:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h20m11s)**  But you can still only get so fast before the weakening solar push meets up with the increasing drag of running through gases in space which keep it from being a total vacuum, achieving terminal velocity just like an object falling on Earth. 

**[00:20:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h20m24s)**  Same concept as a parachute, your solar sail will make that happen at a much slower speed and then you’ve got to pack the thing up, though you can unpack it as you near your destination to slow down. 

**[00:20:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h20m33s)**  You also have to repair and replace damaged sections since slamming through space involves hitting a lot small objects when your sail is a billionth of a meter thick but millions of meter across. 

**[00:20:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h20m43s)**  There is an alternative though, you can hit the sail with lasers instead, or microwaves, masers. 

**[00:20:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h20m50s)**  This lets you concentrate the energy on a much smaller target, needing a smaller sail, and laser beams don’t weaken over distance as inverse square the way sunlight does. 

**[00:21:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h21m00s)**  You’ve also got no way to slow down unless you have a laser at the other end, but as I mentioned we do have some tricks for slowing down and even if you had to carry fuel to slow down in whole or part that’s a lot better than having to carry all the fuel to speed up and to speed up your slow-down fuel too. 

**[00:21:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h21m16s)**  So light sails, or laser sails, are pretty promising. 

**[00:21:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h21m20s)**  The down side is that while we can predict the location of a ship moving through a near vacuum very accurately, it isn’t a pure vacuum so you can’t predict it exactly. 

**[00:21:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h21m29s)**  And the degree of imprecision is going to keep getting bigger the further away it is and the longer you have to wait for a signal to get back telling you definitively where it last was. 

**[00:21:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h21m37s)**  Your laser also is slowly diffusing as the beams aren’t actually perfect cylinders and they are also running into space dust which weakens them to so you have to make your sail bigger and bigger to be accurately aimed at as you get further away. 

**[00:21:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h21m51s)**  At best the size of your sail is going to need to scale up linear to the distance from the transmitter, double the distance, double the sail size, and that’s being unrealistically optimistic. 

**[00:22:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h22m02s)**  If you’re having problems picturing the difference between this and a classic wind sail, imagine a guy with a catcher’s mitt and ice skates on a long smooth sheet of ice. 

**[00:22:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h22m11s)**  You keep throwing him baseballs and he speeds up every time he catches one. 

**[00:22:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h22m15s)**  Eventually though he’s too far away to catch your throws. 

**[00:22:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h22m18s)**  He can also speed up more by bouncing the ball off his mitt instead of catching it and he can steer by bouncing it in a slightly different direction, which works with photons just as well as baseballs. 

**[00:22:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h22m29s)**  Realistically the only way to get around this problem, to get really high speeds, would be to have a long chain of laser emitters along the way that could pick up where the last laser left off, like the guy on the sheet of ice who leaves the range of the first pitcher and passes a second pitcher who begins tossing to him, on to a third, onto a fourth, and so on. 

**[00:22:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h22m48s)**  If the line is long enough pitcher down the road can start slowing him down too by throwing to him as he approaches them rather than as he’s leaving them behind. 

**[00:22:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h22m57s)**  If you saw the fusion video and rogue planet video and rotating habitat video you can probably guess where this is going. 

**[00:23:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h23m04s)**  Interstellar space is lousy with little rocks and comets, and not so little rocks and comets. 

**[00:23:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h23m09s)**  It’s nowhere near as dense as stuff in our solar system but it doesn’t have to be. 

**[00:23:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h23m14s)**  You can set up tons of pusher stations along the way to another star, automated or populated, and basically make yourself a long highway through space that let you shove ships pretty fast, at highly relativistic speeds potentially, and you could build your way out there sort of like building a railroad. 

**[00:23:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h23m29s)**  This is also much easier if you’ve got a free method of breaking like a bussard ramjet or mag sail but at a minimum it’s easier to carry your deceleration fuel but if you don’t have to carry the fuel to accelerate you’ve way more than halved your onboard fuel needs. 

**[00:23:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h23m43s)**  Once you get to the target the first time, and you can build stations down the whole length, you don’t need to carry any fuel except for some maneuvering. 

**[00:23:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h23m52s)**  It probably requires a lot more effort and time than a single one way trip with a nuclear powered ship but once you’ve got it in place you can hurl way more material back and forth faster and cheaper between two star systems. 

**[00:24:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h24m03s)**  That’s important as we move into the actual colonization section of the video because as we’ll see, while all these methods let you colonize planets, none of these methods really make for a sane way to do migration if you’re trying to deal with an overpopulation problem. 

**[00:24:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h24m18s)**  So we’ve looked at most of the ways of getting to alien worlds, what do you do when you get there? 

**[00:24:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h24m23s)**  We discussed terraforming worlds in the terraforming video but while most stars probably have planets, even planets that we could terraform, most won’t have ones that are particularly like Earth and it seems a shame to waste a perfectly good solar system. 

**[00:24:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h24m36s)**  Then too, New Earth probably isn’t going to be your first destination or sole destination on arriving, even if it is amazingly Earth like. 

**[00:24:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h24m45s)**  Let’s think about our generation ship as it slows down and enters a system. 

**[00:24:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h24m49s)**  It’s essentially a rotating habitat, like we discussed in that video, but as I mentioned rotating habitats aren’t great for space travel because an ideal habitat is very Earth-like and that tends to imply it carries a lot more dirt and water on board than is really necessary for a real spaceship where every pound counts. 

**[00:25:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h25m07s)**  Difference between a luxury houseboat or freighter and a speedboat. 

**[00:25:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h25m10s)**  But there’s going to be darn few planets sitting around in the galaxy that conveniently have earth-breathable air mixtures, lighting, and so on so you probably don’t want to be just piling down from your spaceship, where people have been comfortably living for generations, onto the probably barren hellish wasteland of your new world. 

**[00:25:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h25m27s)**  You’re also probably bingo on fuel. 

**[00:25:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h25m30s)**  And unlike setting up a space based infrastructure from down on Earth it’s a lot easier to build one when you’re already up there. 

**[00:25:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h25m36s)**  So destination one is probably not going to be the planet, it’s going to be one or more small rocky or icy asteroids or comets you can intercept easily and basically dock right on top of and snatch resources from. 

**[00:25:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h25m48s)**  Then you go to a planet, probably leaving one or more asteroid bases behind you. 

**[00:25:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h25m54s)**  If you’ve got something strong enough to make a space elevator from, especially if you can synthesize that from local asteroids since they are very heavy, you do that. 

**[00:26:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h26m02s)**  Heck you could coil the elevator around the outside of you ship during the flight as extra radiation shielding but making it on the spot is easier. 

**[00:26:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h26m09s)**  Now you don’t have a generation ship, you’ve got a full blown rotating habitat that can handily serve as spaceport and comfortable living area, more comfortable than you traveled on, parked around your destination planet. 

**[00:26:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h26m22s)**  If you’ve got the elevator than you can unload easier but also reload too, so people aren’t stuck in domes the whole time. 

**[00:26:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h26m28s)**  This makes terraforming a lot easier, especially if the process calls for material not found in great quantity on the planet. 

**[00:26:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h26m36s)**  But realistically, with Earth-like planets around Earth-like suns likely being the minority of solar systems in most cases you won’t even try terraforming planets in favor of basically terraform small moons and asteroids, again as discussed in the Rotating Habitats video. 

**[00:26:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h26m51s)**  They’re not truly planets but they actually will approximate Earth in most respects better than most planets you’ll find. 

**[00:26:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h26m56s)**  The other issue is that colonizing planets, and just planets, is a damnably inefficient way of spreading out your civilization. 

**[00:27:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h27m03s)**  It’s not just all the solar systems you’re bypassing to find nice planets either. 

**[00:27:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h27m07s)**  Let’s walk through some quick math. 

**[00:27:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h27m10s)**  To avoid relativistic calculations and rocketry I’m going to assume real quick that these ships always travel at around a tenth of light speed and are insanely efficient. 

**[00:27:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h27m19s)**  That they let you transport a human and everything he or she needs as though he were just two tons of material magically given the appropriate kinetic energy to be at about 10% of light speed and didn’t need to slow down. 

**[00:27:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h27m30s)**  Kinetic energy being half the mass times the square of velocity, and the velocity being about a tenth of light speed, we get about 10^18 Joules of energy. 

**[00:27:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h27m39s)**  This is almost absurdly generous but we’ll go with it anyway. 

**[00:27:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h27m43s)**  If you remember the video on Fusion, we talked about how you could easily and luxurious support a person for one year trillion joules of energy a year, or 10^12 Joules, one millionth of or way over optimistic figure for getting someone to another star system. 

**[00:27:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h27m58s)**  You could support a thousand people for a thousand years for the energy cost of moving one person to another solar system at a tenth of light speed. 

**[00:28:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h28m06s)**  If you want to get them there twice as fast, it will take at least quadruple the energy. 

**[00:28:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h28m10s)**  So if you’ve want more people, and you need more space, it makes way more sense to build a rotating habitat in our own solar system able to support a thousand people for a thousand years in luxury than to cram one person on a ship. 

**[00:28:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h28m23s)**  Particularly considering you’ve already got a star on hand pumping out a billion times more energy than we use on Earth all going to waste. 

**[00:28:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h28m30s)**  Send people slower, at say 1% of light speed, and it costs about a hundredth the power as 10% light speed, again assuming very amazingly efficient propulsion and life support. 

**[00:28:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h28m40s)**  That’s still all the juice you need to support one person for 10,000 years as opposed to sending one person to another solar system. 

**[00:28:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h28m47s)**  This doesn’t mean you can’t colonize, it just means it isn’t a particularly sane way to get rid of surplus populations. 

**[00:28:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h28m54s)**  Just like colonizing some new continent, you don’t ship half your population there, you send small colonies and wait for them to grow. 

**[00:29:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h29m02s)**  Of course if you’ve got a whole star’s excess energy to play with, while you’re building up the inevitable Dyson Sphere or Dyson Swarm you can use all that extra energy to power laser sails. 

**[00:29:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h29m11s)**  So you don’t have to pick and choose because the star is pumping out absurd amounts of otherwise wasted energy the whole time and it’s a lot easier to build solar panels than effectively fake micro-planets. 

**[00:29:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h29m22s)**  Hopefully you have fusion but you can beam power around out from your star, losing some at each step, but just like the beaming stations for possible laser sails you can feed your solar power outwards with reasonable efficiency if you need to run operations too far from the sun for natural sunlight to power them, and if you haven’t got fusion. 

**[00:29:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h29m41s)**  So, here we are at the end, and we’ve got a bit of a callback to the original Dyson Dilemma video of the Fermi Paradox. 

**[00:29:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h29m48s)**  In that I proposed that you’d expect to see alien civilizations expanding outwards constantly by swallowing stars into wave upon wave of Dyson Swarms, massive cloudlike constructs of artificial habitats and solar collectors. 

**[00:30:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h30m01s)**  Here we see a slight alteration on that theme. 

**[00:30:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h30m03s)**  Instead of jumping from G-type yellow star to star, settling a few Earth-like planets in the classic science fiction setup, or even swallowing every star inside giant Dyson Swarms, we’d probably expect civilizations like our own to slowly roll out. 

**[00:30:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h30m16s)**  They’d Dyson up their star, like giant cities, but they’d settle small rocks in the outer solar system and run those on fusion obtained from gas giants, in a sort of wide disc. 

**[00:30:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h30m26s)**  Think of these as suburbs. 

**[00:30:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h30m29s)**  From their they’d roll out into their own Oort Cloud and interstellar space and grabbing the rare rocks and turning them into habitats powered by fusion. 

**[00:30:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h30m36s)**  This becomes your rural areas, and the stretches along the way to various nearby solar systems become your highways, possibly pushing ships along or slowing them down and allowing much higher bandwidths of information transfer between solar systems since the beams can be kept nice and narrow and high density with all the relays, these enter the developing suburbs of another solar system’s outer areas and the emerging Dyson Swarm near the Star, another city on the grow, of course these cities have trillions of times more people in them then modern earth cities, and the rural areas are trillions of times less dense than our own, but the analogy holds and is probably way more likely to be how we’d settle the galaxy then we tend to envision in classic science fiction setup. 

**[00:31:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h31m17s)**  And in this kind of setup you can also migrate people a lot cheaper, because they don’t have to move very fast to avoid boredom and you can start employing methods that let you recover some or even most of your kinetic energy used for transport, like a mass driver that shoots you from one habitat toward another one which catches you using the reverse process and sucks your kinetic out to power another launch. 

**[00:31:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h31m40s)**  Or bouncing the pushing laser beam off the mirror on the back of the ship to be reabsorbed by a large solar panel array back at the station. 

**[00:31:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h31m48s)**  Someone wanting to leave Earth for new worlds just slowly bounces from place to place, every outward, always with some new place to see, at slower speeds and thus using less energy travel. 

**[00:31:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h31m58s)**  If they’re biologically immortal they’ve got all the time in the world to see a place, hop on board slow freighter to something much closer than the next star, see that place, and move on, slowly working outward. 

**[00:32:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h32m09s)**  If not, if like you and me they age, then they settle somewhere not too far from earth and their kids continue the journey. 

**[00:32:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h32m16s)**  You mosey outward to the galaxy at say an average speed of a thousandth the speed of light and you get to the edge of the galaxy in a hundred million years, about one percent of the age of the Universe currently and it’s pretty young still. 

**[00:32:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h32m29s)**  You can do it faster of course, as we’ve seen. 

**[00:32:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h32m32s)**  Now at the edge galaxy you stop right? 

**[00:32:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h32m35s)**  Well, nope, you don’t have to cross endless empty space to the next galaxy because it isn’t empty space, just emptier. 

**[00:32:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h32m43s)**  Like Interstellar space compared to interplanetary space it’s got a lot of stuff in it just more spread out. 

**[00:32:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h32m49s)**  Some estimates suggests as many as half the stars in the Universe are between galaxies not in them, and galaxies aren’t spaced out like solar systems are. 

**[00:32:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h32m59s)**  Galaxies are only about an order of magnitude, ten times, further apart from each other than they are wide. 

**[00:33:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h33m04s)**  So you’d have to travel a lot further to get to the next star roughly along the way to that new galaxy but we’re talking hundreds or thousands of light years not millions, each one serving as a new beachhead. 

**[00:33:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h33m15s)**  And that’s interstellar and intergalactic colonization for you. 

**[00:33:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h33m19s)**  And that’s it for year one of this channel, we’ll have a channel update video sometime soon then press ahead with some of our other megastructures and habitable planets subjects but now we can broaden out and look at other subjects because we’ve come full circle with the Dyson Dilemma and Fermi Paradox. 

**[00:33:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h33m34s)**  Back in that we encountered the problem that we just couldn’t see how any technological civilization even a little like our own wouldn’t expand out constantly if it could expand reasonably, and how we shouldn’t be able to miss seeing them even if they were galaxies away if they’d been doing that. 

**[00:33:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h33m48s)**  Now we’ve taken the long road to explain how that could be done without needing any truly groundbreaking, paradigm shifting science and technology. 

**[00:33:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h33m56s)**  Leaving us right back at the question, if aliens are out there, why haven’t we seen them yet? 

**[00:34:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h34m02s)**  And an answer, not a definite one but an increasingly likely one, that if there are other intelligent alien civilizations like our own out there they are so rare that you’d probably need to search a million galaxies just to find one. 

**[00:34:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h34m16s)**  The Dyson Dilemma of the Fermi Paradox, if there were any older civilizations nearby us we would see them simply by the absence of any stars in the night sky. 

**[00:34:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h34m25s)**  Thanks for joining me on this year long trip, if you’ve arrived here from all the older videos, it’s been a fun time and there will be more ahead. 

**[00:34:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=3y3MmmfZmP8&t=00h34m34s)**  If this was your first video on the channel, hopefully not seeing the others yet didn’t make this too information dense and compressed, but you might want to go try those other videos now.
