So today we’re going to be discussing Flat Earths, disc-shaped artificial worlds, Alderson Discs, and the general notion of how gravity, lighting, seasons, and orbit around these things would work. 

**[00:00:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h00m24s)**  The last video in the series, Shellworlds, involved a type of megastructure we don’t see too much of in fiction, discworlds on the other hand are incredibly common. 

**[00:00:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h00m35s)**  Probably the best known example would be the late Sir Terry Pratchett’s massive fantasy parody series appropriately named Discworld which ended at nearly half a hundred books and over 70 million sold. 

**[00:00:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h00m47s)**  He died a year back so this video is something of a tribute to one of my favorite authors on the anniversary of his death and I’d strongly recommend him to others. 

**[00:00:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h00m56s)**  The concept of a discworld itself requires little introduction, but Flat Earths come in a lot of styles and I wanted to give these a deeper look than they tend to get when looked at as seeming impossibilities. 

**[00:01:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h01m07s)**  So for the rest of the video we will all be honorary members of the Flat Earth Society and we’ll even look at their model because while it is flat out wrong, pardon the pun, it is surprisingly well constructed. 

**[00:01:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h01m18s)**  What we won’t be looking at is Pratchett’s specific discworld, a flat disc on top of the backs of four giant elephants standing on a colossal turtle since much like the weather patterns from George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones it was never meant to have a natural and physically possible explanation. 

**[00:01:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h01m35s)**  Now the usual image someone gets of a Flat Earth is a square or rectangle, something you could sail of the edge of and has four corners, but while that is also possible the actual concept has normally revolved around a disc shape. 

**[00:01:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h01m49s)**  We’re pretty used to seeing Mercator Projection maps but an Azimuthal Equidistant Projection is also pretty popular, it’s what we use for the United Nations logo, and it fits on disc just fine. 

**[00:02:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h02m01s)**  As you can see, there is no way to sail off the edge of such a thing. 

**[00:02:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h02m06s)**  You can fly all the way around the world east to west on a circle with your compass always pointing north. 

**[00:02:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h02m11s)**  If you go south toward the edge you eventually hit an impassable frozen landscape of Antartica, not that you’d fall off anyway, you’d just curve around the rim to the other side. 

**[00:02:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h02m21s)**  Interestingly while most images of flat worlds have a sun that circles around the planet the version put forward by the Flat Earth Society has a sun thirty miles across that circles over the Earth, and that’s not quite as ridiculous as it initially sounds since light has pressure. 

**[00:02:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h02m38s)**  We’ve talked about moving stars with their own emitted light or propelling spaceships with laser beams using that light force, and to keep an object hovering in a gravity field you need to provide it the same force, but in the opposite direction, that gravity exerts. 

**[00:02:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h02m55s)**  That translates as a bit over a billion watts per ton of sun, and the sun hits us with about a hundred million times that light, so a thirty mile diameter sun weighing about a hundred million tons would be quite capable of hovering over the earth and could circle above it just by tilting itself a bit to change its direction of thrust. 

**[00:03:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h03m16s)**  This actually works a lot better than a sun circling the planet so if you’re building fake suns that basically giant light bulbs it might make more sense to just go with a cocked light bulb tethered by its power cord to the north pole and pushing up and slightly rimward. 

**[00:03:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h03m30s)**  We’ll come back to discussing gravity and orbits in a little while but first let’s review the lighting system. 

**[00:03:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h03m38s)**  If we built a flat planet, shaped like a coin, around a normal sun, then we could spin it to produce day and night just like on Earth. 

**[00:03:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h03m47s)**  This does give us our first limitation on size though since you can only get so big before centrifugal forces at the rim would exceed gravity and throw you off. 

**[00:03:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h03m57s)**  You can have seasons, like on Earth, by giving it an axial tilt. 

**[00:04:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m02s)**  What you can’t have is temperature variation based on being north or south. 

**[00:04:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m07s)**  Tilted or not, every bit of the planet gets the same amount of light. 

**[00:04:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m12s)**  It isn’t Earth’s axial tilt that makes the poles cold. 

**[00:04:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m16s)**  It’s that they are steeply angled compared to the sun. 

**[00:04:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m19s)**  If you take a piece of paper and start it off perpendicular to a light, it’s intercepting the maximum amount of light, as we turn it away to be angled it intercepts less and less light until its parallel and intercepts none at all. 

**[00:04:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m33s)**  But its total surface remains the same, so that’s less light per square foot. 

**[00:04:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m39s)**  Less light, less warmth, so its colder. 

**[00:04:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m43s)**  So a flat disc can be angled to have seasons, but the whole thing experiences the same temperature since then entire disk is at the same angle to the sun. 

**[00:04:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m53s)**  At least when the sun is an actual normal old star not some fake approximation. 

**[00:04:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h04m59s)**  This brings up the Alderson Disk, which is a hypothetical megastructure that’s a big flat disc around a star, one with a surface area comparable to a Dyson Sphere, more than a billion times what Earth has, which makes it an attractive idea. 

**[00:05:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h05m15s)**  This thing is actually a very silly megastructure in and of itself because it gets virtually no light. 

**[00:05:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h05m21s)**  Even less than you might expect since it also has a giant rim wall to prevent air leaking into the sun. 

**[00:05:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h05m26s)**  It’s also got the problem that it should want to contract into itself and no known material would be strong enough to be able to stop that. 

**[00:05:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h05m36s)**  Some versions of these just hand wave the sun bobbing up and down in the middle to better light the disc, how this is accomplished is unknown since stars don’t generally bob up and down and they certainly do not do this around absolutely nothing at a pace sufficient to do it once a day and at a steep enough angle to matter. 

**[00:05:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h05m54s)**  So that’s where Alderson Disks tend to get abandoned but that is selling the notion rather short. 

**[00:06:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h06m00s)**  We’ll get to the work around for disk’s crunching up, and of not having gravity point straight down, in a little bit. 

**[00:06:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h06m07s)**  Let’s light up an Alderson Disk. 

**[00:06:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h06m10s)**  I mentioned a bit ago how an artificial sun might hold itself up just by its own radiation acting like a thruster, but this is even easier around a star using mirrors. 

**[00:06:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h06m20s)**  There is a device known as a Statite. 

**[00:06:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h06m23s)**  This is a highly reflective and thin satellite which does not orbit, or does not orbit normally, but instead simply hovers in place by reflecting sunlight away. 

**[00:06:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h06m33s)**  We’re already talking about building one giant thick disk around a sun, a couple thin ones is a minor matter. 

**[00:06:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h06m40s)**  Incidentally with statites distance is not a factor. 

**[00:06:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h06m45s)**  While the force holding them up is dependent on the total light hitting them, which falls off as the inverse square of distance, the gravitational force pulling on them also falls off as the inverse square of distance so two identical statites will both hover the same even if one is far further away than the other. 

**[00:07:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h07m04s)**  The key variable two how thick a statites needs to be to hover, or it’s mass per unit of cross section, so it doesn’t fall or fly off, is how bright a star is compared to how massive it is. 

**[00:07:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h07m17s)**  Bigger stars actually produce far more light per unit of mass than small ones, that’s why giant stars don’t live very long, so ironically you can build thicker statites around more massive stars. 

**[00:07:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h07m31s)**  So you can hover thin disks, one or a collection of them, over the sun, to reflect light over the whole disk. 

**[00:07:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h07m39s)**  You can give them curvature and angles to produce bands of day and night and even twilight, and either have them spin or have the disk spin to give days and even season by having the statites mirrors not be of uniform width or reflectivity. 

**[00:07:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h07m53s)**  So that’s the lighting issue solved, and it’s actually an amazingly easy fix. 

**[00:07:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h07m57s)**  Now let’s talk about the gravity generated by disks in general. 

**[00:08:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m02s)**  Like most things if you’re far enough away you can treat it as a point like object, and if you’re circle around the rim it still acts fairly normally. 

**[00:08:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m10s)**  Our issue is above it, or below it, but fairly close to it. 

**[00:08:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m16s)**  If you’re at the very center the gravity acts perpendicular to the surface, so everything is fine. 

**[00:08:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m20s)**  But as you get out from the middle the direction of gravity is going to start tilting at an angle. 

**[00:08:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m27s)**  By the time you reach the rim its pointing almost entirely toward the middle, that’s why you can’t fall off the edge, you’d just walk around. 

**[00:08:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m35s)**  If you took a flat disk, rectangle, cylinder or cube and poured water onto it its gravity would make it lump up into the cap of a rough sphere around the middle. 

**[00:08:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m46s)**  And that’s a bit of problem unless you want great big oceans in the middle and land all around the rim. 

**[00:08:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m54s)**  Also your air will do the same thing which becomes more than a landscaping concern. 

**[00:08:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h08m59s)**  So what is the work around for that? 

**[00:09:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m01s)**  What about the whole problem of the disc crunching together into a sphere? 

**[00:09:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m05s)**  We can get around the crunching with centrifugal force, by spinning the disc, which helps us with gravity too. 

**[00:09:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m12s)**  The further from the center you are, the more centrifugal force acts on you pushing you outwards. 

**[00:09:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m18s)**  To a certain point you can spin your disk to counteract the crunching force of gravity trying to make it a sphere and making water, air, and people tend to migrate to the center. 

**[00:09:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m27s)**  But this is an overly simple and non-ideal solution. 

**[00:09:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m31s)**  First off, these models of disks always assume the structure is homogenous in density, that makes sense since if you had denser parts they’d just fall toward the middle and that would exacerbate the gravitational tilt to the center. 

**[00:09:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m48s)**  Relatively large disks couldn’t be made of rigid materials able to avoid doing that either. 

**[00:09:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m52s)**  But if you’ve been following the megastructures series a couple workarounds should be occurring to you by now. 

**[00:09:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h09m57s)**  We’ve talked a lot in this series about active support structures, in the very first episode we talked about orbital rings, in the third we talked about space fountains, and we revisited both concepts last time in Shellworlds video. 

**[00:10:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h10m12s)**  You may want to review those if that’s new to you but the summary version that if you’ve got a stream of matter orbiting a planet, or a star, inside a pipe, you can keep that pipe stationary and rigid so long is it, and anything sitting on it, has a combined momentum with the orbiting particles equal to what the whole sum ought to have if orbiting normal. 

**[00:10:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h10m35s)**  You speed up those particles as you add more weight to your stationary structure, which would normally be magnetically levitating over the matter stream. 

**[00:10:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h10m43s)**  Ditto you can have atlas-like pillars holding things up by just firing mass up a long narrow straight tube to be magnetically slowed near the top, transferring their momentum to whatever you’ve got hovering at the top. 

**[00:10:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h10m57s)**  In this way you could keep two huge objects separate without them needing to orbit each other, and the only energy loss would be on how inefficient your mechanisms were. 

**[00:11:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m07s)**  If they were 100% efficient you’d never need to add anymore energy after the first influx to get it going. 

**[00:11:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m15s)**  We can use both of these structures, orbital rings and space fountains, in construction of super large discs. 

**[00:11:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m22s)**  Let’s say we started with a big orbital ring around a sun, for an alderson disc, or small fat cylinder for a normal discworld, it could be touching for the latter. 

**[00:11:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m33s)**  Only this ring segment is hollow and its full of mass spinning around in orbit. 

**[00:11:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m38s)**  We pack so much mass into this that it’s a little denser the core. 

**[00:11:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m43s)**  The orbiting material keep the segment rigid and also provides gravity above it. 

**[00:11:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m48s)**  Then we put another ring in, touching the first, where the mass is denser. 

**[00:11:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m53s)**  And another, and another. 

**[00:11:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h11m55s)**  We make the disc as thick as necessary to ensure we can pack all the requisite matter into that last layer. 

**[00:12:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h12m03s)**  Since these outer rings have way more matter in them, in terms of being denser, this negates out that inward pull to the center, and you can even add in some centrifugal force to make that a bit easier. 

**[00:12:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h12m15s)**  Now you can either just use the sides of these rings as your firmament to build on or throw over a skin which keeps from crushing together by using those space fountains, those atlas pillars. 

**[00:12:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h12m27s)**  Bingo, nice even gravitating disc. 

**[00:12:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h12m30s)**  In the case of the giant Alderson Disc we still need that airwall to keep air from sliding into the sun but that’s fine, we just make that a huge solar panel to carry energy out to keep all the other mass spinning. 

**[00:12:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h12m42s)**  Whatever you’re using as your filler material, the stuff running through those pipes, is something you’re going to need a lot of since its generating your gravity too, but as we discussed in the Shellworlds video the universe has tons of hydrogen and helium which aren’t things you’d normally build Earth-like planets out of, but cramming it into these orbital rings to generate gravity is just as doable as using it for stuffing in Shellworlds. 

**[00:13:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h13m08s)**  You don’t necessarily need to use the orbital rings approach either, if you want something weird like a rectangle instead of a circular disc. 

**[00:13:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h13m17s)**  You just make very long space fountains radiating out from the middle holding everything apart and pack the innards with rigid pockets of matter of the right density, presumably hollow rigid objects full of gas. 

**[00:13:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h13m30s)**  You can also make the disc wider as you get further out if you’re having problems getting the necessary density in those outer layers to keep the gravity high enough but I dislike that since it isn’t a flat earth anymore. 

**[00:13:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h13m43s)**  You can also add in walls, probably stylized as circular mountain ranges, to help hold in air and water if you’re not quite pulling off nice even gravity and those same space fountains holding it apart can also be used for bulk matter transport to help deal with issues of slow drift or erosion. 

**[00:14:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h14m01s)**  Now how dense these things have to be is another matter. 

**[00:14:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h14m06s)**  Actually it doesn’t matter, so long as the disc is significantly thinner than it is wide. 

**[00:14:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h14m12s)**  For an infinite plane of mass gravity doesn’t drop as you get farther above or below it and so it doesn’t matter how thick it is, just how much stuff is in there, it can be thick but not dense or dense and thin, all that matters is how much mass is under a given area of the surface. 

**[00:14:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h14m32s)**  So long as your discworld is thin enough compared to your diameter, and your distance above it is much smaller than that diameter, it doesn’t matter if you’re packing your discworld with super-dense neutronium or pressurized hydrogen and helium. 

**[00:14:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h14m47s)**  But if you’re making something with a living area comparable to Earth you do need it pretty dense, a couple thousand miles thick of something at least as dense as steel would do, but denser is better because you really want to keep your discs significant thinner than their diameter. 

**[00:15:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h15m04s)**  For something as big as an Alderson disc it would still be paper thin compared to its diameter even if you let it be a hundred thousand miles thick, and that makes it a lot easier to fill it with pressurized gases for gravity and having higher pressure, higher density ones near the exterior to even out your gravity. 

**[00:15:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h15m22s)**  Needless to say if you’ve got artificial gravity you can skip all this, and artificial gravity isn’t definitely off the radar of future technologies. 

**[00:15:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h15m33s)**  We still don’t know if gravity and electromagnetic forces unify, that’s that whole grand unified theory you sometimes hear about is… …but if they do unify it is conceivably possible you might be able to make a gravity generator that runs off electricity, or an electric generator that runs on gravity, the same as we can whack something with photons and knock out electrons or vice-versa, producing gravitons instead. 

**[00:15:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h15m58s)**  Even if that’s possible it might easily require way more effort than just using bulk matter anyway, but it might be possible and it would seriously simplify things. 

**[00:16:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h16m09s)**  Getting back to the lighting and seasons issues before we close out, we first have to decide how we’re getting our light and how big our disk is. 

**[00:16:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h16m18s)**  For the Alderson Disk that’s just a sun with mirrors hanging overhead. 

**[00:16:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h16m22s)**  In the Flat Earth Society model it’s a disc or sphere around thirty miles across and so is the moon, I’m not too sure how eclipses work in that model though, they use something called a Shadow Object that orbits the Sun I think. 

**[00:16:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h16m35s)**  Like I said I find it rather fascinating how intricate that model actually is but its still nonsense. 

**[00:16:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h16m41s)**  I’d probably do it by having both as discs that occasionally pass each other directly sometimes above or below the other to do lunar or solar eclipses. 

**[00:16:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h16m52s)**  In my version the sun and moon are thin lightbulbs keeping a float by their own radiation pressure, like a big rocket thruster connected to a big leash of a power cord keeping it circular around the pole, where you can maybe wind the cord back or out to help simulate seasons or just lower the power a little when you want it colder. 

**[00:17:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h17m10s)**  If you want a sun actually orbiting the planet geocentrically then you need the sun placed at a distance that results in a 24 hour orbit of the disc. 

**[00:17:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h17m20s)**  That won’t quite be a circle since it is a disc not a sphere but you aren’t necessarily limited to normal Newtonian Mechanics here either since that’s obviously not a real sun. 

**[00:17:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h17m31s)**  I don’t think there’s any disc size you could produce that would have a disc significantly more massive than a star, still have regular Earth gravity, and still have orbits around it of less than a day that weren’t either passing through the disc or so close as to burn it. 

**[00:17:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h17m46s)**  If you’re not using a regular star, either because it’s got its own refuelable fusion reactor or a black hole or something in it then you don’t really need to worry much about normal orbital mechanics because the output of power would be so high compared to the mass of the fake sun, compared to normal suns, that it would basically be a spaceship quite capable of charting any path it felt like. 

**[00:18:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h18m09s)**  Sort of like Apollo or Helios or Ra or whichever sun god riding around on their chariot or solar boat you prefer. 

**[00:18:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h18m16s)**  In fact, as we’ll talk about in the next video on black hole powered ships, the mass of a black hole big enough to light a whole planet – or rather small enough since less massive smaller black holes actually radiate more energy, you’d only need a sun of about a hundred thousand tons, about as much as an aircraft carrier, to illuminate a whole planet and about that same mass of fuel every year so there’s a lot to be said for a big spaceship sun just flying around the disc planet once a day, either doing a whole circle or just having two, one for each side of the planet, landing at the rims. 

**[00:18:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h18m54s)**  Depending on how high you are over the planet the path you take is going to make some areas more brightly lit then others and so hot and cold respectively and you can vary your path and distance to produce seasons or keep to regular path but have the world spin once a year. 

**[00:19:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h19m10s)**  Using a regular star, as I mentioned earlier, doesn’t let you have cold areas near the poles, you can still have axial tilt give you seasons but it will be just as warm everywhere. 

**[00:19:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h19m22s)**  Amusingly you could have disc after disc form a bracelet around a star in a ring and run big circle around to their poles as a train between worlds, or a big topopolis like we discussed at the end of the rotating habitats video, so the Alderson Disc isn’t the only option for one essentially super large land mass you could navigate around without needing a space ship. 

**[00:19:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h19m45s)**  That’s how you build one, big or small. 

**[00:19:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h19m49s)**  Now the real issue is why you’d build one and while we could rationalize making Shellworlds instead of rotating habitats, discworlds are a bit harder. 

**[00:19:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h19m58s)**  They are not as mass efficient as a Shellworld, spheres are more efficient than discs in terms of the amount of matter you need inside to get gravity over your living area. 

**[00:20:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h20m10s)**  In both you can use multiple layers so long as you provide artificial lighting to lower layers and can get rid of your waste heat. 

**[00:20:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h20m18s)**  Discworlds just aren’t as much like Earth as a Shellworld is and also aren’t quite as mass efficient as a Shellworld, which is already an incredibly inefficient use of mass. 

**[00:20:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h20m30s)**  So Discworlds probably are stuck in the category of impractical megastructures, but not so bad compared to Shellworlds that if you’re building lots of those you’d never contemplate building a Disk. 

**[00:20:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h20m42s)**  It’s probably going to be a while before we revisit the megastructures series so I’m not going to pick a subject for the next episode yet. 

**[00:20:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h20m50s)**  Besides Youtube just created this fun polling system and as mentioned next time we’ll be talking about black hole powered ships and some general use of black holes as power sources, since that is what the first poll overwhelmingly favored. 

**[00:21:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h21m03s)**  I like this system so from now at the end of videos instead of just announcing the next video and playing the credits and some music and popping up the channel’s playlists I’m going to star adding a poll for the next, next video after that and asking for suggested topics down in the comments section. 

**[00:21:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h21m21s)**  I’ll sort through those suggestions and see what seems like good topics I can do justice to and throw them up into the next poll. 

**[00:21:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h21m28s)**  Most of the viewers for a given video will probably be after that poll is concluded so if you don’t see it popping up then I probably took it down already. 

**[00:21:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h21m37s)**  If it’s up, please take a moment to weigh in on what topics we should look at next. 

**[00:21:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=U2bc7kZcpmQ&t=00h21m42s)**  As always comments and questions are welcome below, I try to get to as many as I can.
