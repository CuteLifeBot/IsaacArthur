Today we’ll be looking at the Doomsday Argument, a probability based argument that predicts the end of humanity sometime in the next few thousand years. 

**[00:00:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h00m21s)**  Also, since it applies to any alien civilizations, how this Argument came to be seen as one of the possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox. 

**[00:00:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h00m28s)**  The apparent contradiction between just how old and big the Universe is and the seeming absence of any other intelligent life besides ourselves. 

**[00:00:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h00m35s)**  There’s more than one Doomsday Argument, but today we are looking at the version known as the Carter Catastrophe. 

**[00:00:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h00m41s)**  We’ll be looking at it is stating, how it came about, what is claims and why, and its strengths and weaknesses. 

**[00:00:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h00m48s)**  Also this video is something of a companion video to last week’s episode on the Simulation Hypothesis and forms a loose trilogy with the video on Transhumanism and Immortality, so you might want watch those first though it isn’t absolutely necessary. 

**[00:01:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h01m01s)**  As is often the case in these videos I’ll be using some more obscure terms at times so coupled to my speech impediment I’d suggest you turn on the closed caption subtitles now. 

**[00:01:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h01m10s)**  Also, since we will be talking about the Fermi Paradox, one of the major interests on this channel, you will occasionally see video links pop up on the screen like we have now, where we discussed some topic in more detail. 

**[00:01:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h01m21s)**  Clicking on those just pauses this video and opens that in a new window. 

**[00:01:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h01m25s)**  Now the Doomsday Argument is one of those concepts most people hate, what’s interesting is that their reasons for doing so are often quite different and often fairly logically unsound. 

**[00:01:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h01m35s)**  There’s a kneejerk response to the concept a lot of times simply because it is a Doomsday Scenario and it’s also statistical, but I think it is because people often do a bad job explaining it and often cite related concepts instead the actual argument and the assumptions it rests on. 

**[00:01:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h01m50s)**  It is also a very hard one to explain the statistical concept on in an intuitive fashion, as I just found out myself trying to craft this script. 

**[00:01:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h01m57s)**  It’s incredibly easy to explain to anyone with a background in Bayesian analysis, trying to circumvent that led to a few drafts where I realized I’d spent about 20 minutes explaining statistics before even stating the basis of the argument, then another 10 explaining the Sleeping Beauty Problem, which is a somewhat creepy thought experiment involving doping a young lady up with sleeping pills and mind altering drugs. 

**[00:02:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h02m18s)**  You knock her out, wake up, ask her a question, flip a coin, and based on the results drug her up with some memory erasing agent and wake her again. 

**[00:02:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h02m25s)**  Now there’s a more disturbing version of that thought problem that Nick Bostorm thought up, and for that matter I developed a pretty morbid one involving clones about a decade back, unsurprisingly while I was stationed in a warzone, which eerily resembles a recent Doctor Who episode called ‘Heaven Sent’, one of Steven Moffat’s best scripts in my opinion, but we won’t be looking at either of those today. 

**[00:02:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h02m45s)**  Now the Sleeping Beauty Problem is very relevant to the Doomsday Argument but we’ll be mostly bypassing it today, just covering it briefly near the end, and I mention it because what it also reminded me of was that he had developed what I think is probably one of the most intuitively clear explanations of the Doomsday Argument so I am going to borrow his with some minor modifications to update it, and I will link his write-up on the matter in the video description below. 

**[00:03:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h03m08s)**  Bostrom’s also very well known for the Anthropic Principle, which is very heavily tied into Doomsday Argument, but another fellow who is linked up with that concept and actually formally named it is Brandon Carter, from who the Doomsday Argument’s Alternate name, the Carter Catastrophe, gets its name. 

**[00:03:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h03m23s)**  Carter is not a philosopher like Bostrom, he’s a theoretical physicist and got his doctorate under the same professor as Stephen Hawking did the year before, and the two developed quite a lot of black hole and general relativity concepts together with some others. 

**[00:03:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h03m37s)**  So Carter developed the Anthropic Principle and in 1983 did a presentation on the Doomsday argument, as a thought experiment, he never published it but it stirred up a lot of thought on the matter and a lot of future papers. 

**[00:03:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h03m48s)**  Let me lay out the concept with this thought experiment, again borrowing heavily form Bostrom’s explanation. 

**[00:03:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h03m54s)**  You have been placed in a building with a hundred identical rooms without windows, just a door and you’re locked inside. 

**[00:03:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h03m59s)**  You find a note telling you that there are 100 such rooms with a person in each one. 

**[00:04:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m04s)**  It also says that each door, on the outside that you can’t see, has been painted either red or blue. 

**[00:04:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m09s)**  And that you must guess correctly and only get one guess. 

**[00:04:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m13s)**  Now at this point you don’t know anything but that, and you’ve got a coin in your pocket and figure you might as well flip it to decide, because there’s a 50/50 chance it will be right. 

**[00:04:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m21s)**  Even if the number of doors painted each color isn’t the same. 

**[00:04:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m23s)**  Even if 90 doors are blue and only ten red, even if all the doors are just one color. 

**[00:04:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m29s)**  Your coin has a 50/50 chance of being right and is the best odds for success you’ve got. 

**[00:04:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m34s)**  Whichever color your door is, you’ve got a 50/50 chance of being right with the coin flip. 

**[00:04:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m39s)**  Now another note is slipped under the door and it tells you that, indeed, 90 doors are blue and 10 are red. 

**[00:04:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h04m44s)**  This is new information, you don’t know what your door is but if you choose to assume you yourself are a random sample of the rooms, we’ll call this the self-sampling assumption, then you should figure there’s a 90% chance your door is blue and a 10% chance it is red. 

**[00:05:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h05m00s)**  Such being the case, by selecting blue you have 90% chance of being right and while the coin flip would still give you a 50% chance, it would seem logical to pick blue on that 90% chance offered by the self-sampling assumption, that you yourself are a random sample of the 100 observers. 

**[00:05:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h05m17s)**  Okay now let’s switch things up, one hundred rooms again but this time they have a number outside, 1-100. 

**[00:05:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h05m24s)**  This time your note tells you that they took a list of 110 people and you were placed in this room after they, the people doing this, flipped a coin. 

**[00:05:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h05m32s)**  They will not tell you what the result was or what your room number is, but that on tails they took the first 100 people on the list and placed one person in each room, and on heads they took the last 10 people on the list and placed a person in each of the first ten rooms, 1-10. 

**[00:05:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h05m47s)**  You are asked to guess if there are 10 people or 100. 

**[00:05:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h05m51s)**  So now you know, if it came up heads you must be in rooms 1-10. 

**[00:05:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h05m55s)**  You are after all here. 

**[00:05:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h05m57s)**  If it came up tails then you could be in any of the hundred rooms. 

**[00:06:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h06m01s)**  It would seem coin flip odds there are 10 or 100 people and it would initially seem flipping a coin yourself was the logical move. 

**[00:06:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h06m09s)**  And indeed, once again that offers a 50/50 chance of being right based on what you know. 

**[00:06:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h06m15s)**  Yet at the same time if there are 110 people on that list, wouldn’t it seem more likely you were one of the 100, not one of 10? 

**[00:06:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h06m22s)**  100 being 91% of 110, isn’t there arguably a 91% chance you are one of the 100, and only a 9% chance of being one of the 10? 

**[00:06:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h06m33s)**  If you assume you were randomly picked off that list of 110 than simply being here yourself indicates it is more likely you are one of the 100, we’ll call that Self-Indication Assumption. 

**[00:06:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h06m44s)**  There is, incidentally, a huge and constant battle between supporters of these two assumptions, SSA and SIA. 

**[00:06:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h06m50s)**  But let’s say I get my door open somehow and can see the number 7 on the outside, but before I can do anything else I’m chased back into my room by a monster and new note is passed under saying ‘decide now, was the coin heads, 10 people, or tails, 100 people’. 

**[00:07:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m06s)**  Okay, I have a new piece of information. 

**[00:07:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m08s)**  I am in room 7. 

**[00:07:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m10s)**  What does this tell us? 

**[00:07:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m11s)**  I mean if I’m part of the hundred I could still be in room 7, someone had to be, but if I was one of 10 I could obviously be too. 

**[00:07:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m19s)**  So how did I get here, was there a 50% chance that it came up heads, 10 people, and a 1 in 10 chance I am in room 7, or a 50% chance it came up tails, 100 people, and a 1% chance I am in room 7? 

**[00:07:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m31s)**  Well using Bayes Thereom we can crank that out real quick, and this time it will tell me there’s a 9% chance I am part of 100, and a 91% chance I am part of the 10. 

**[00:07:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m41s)**  The exact opposite odds I get if I assumed I was more likely to have been part of the 100 on the list of 110. 

**[00:07:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m47s)**  Now before we proceed I want you to take a moment to decide how you feel on this. 

**[00:07:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m51s)**  Do you think, by seeing the #7 on the door, that we should be assuming we are probably in the 10, or do you think that’s flawed? 

**[00:07:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h07m58s)**  It’s not a trick question or anything. 

**[00:08:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h08m00s)**  I just want you decide if you feel seeing door #7 makes it more likely you are 1 of 10, and keep your answer in mind. 

**[00:08:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h08m07s)**  Okay, let’s step this over to the Doomsday Argument now. 

**[00:08:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h08m10s)**  If you’ve been following the Fermi Paradox videos then you might remember one of our categories of solutions was that idea that high-tech alien civilizations are rare because they kill themselves off, and we looked at a lot of those extinction scenarios in the Fermi Paradox Apocalypse How video. 

**[00:08:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h08m26s)**  We’ll call this general set of scenarios the Doom Soon group, and for our purposes today it doesn’t matter what causes the apocalypse anymore than it matters how you got stuck on that list of 110 or where the building actually is. 

**[00:08:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h08m38s)**  We’ve also explored on this channel the concepts of colonizing our solar system and our galaxy and of building giant megastructures and dyson spheres and how in such setups you’d expect immense populations where more people are born every day then ever lived so far, and how such civilizations could go on for billions or trillions of years or even longer, outliving even the stars. 

**[00:08:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h08m59s)**  Though in the end time and entropy catch up to you and your civilization ends. 

**[00:09:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h09m03s)**  We’ll call this the Doom Late group. 

**[00:09:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h09m06s)**  In the Doom Soon group, if you sat down every person who ever lived and handed them a numbered card based on when they were born the Adam and Eve get #1 and #2 and based on our most recent estimates you and I would be getting one just over 100 billion, and the last man born would get, say, 1 trillion. 

**[00:09:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h09m23s)**  In the Doom Late scenario we give out the same cards and our actual number is going to be disgustingly high, especially if we throw in the Whole Brain Emulation folks operating under the Landauer Limit we discussed in the last couple videos, in that you can get a total number of human lifetimes out of a galaxy well in excess of a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion people. 

**[00:09:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h09m42s)**  But for simplicity I’ll just go with a million trillion, or a quintillion people, shrinking it by about 30 orders of magnitude, the difference between a grapefruit’s mass and our sun’s. 

**[00:09:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h09m51s)**  So Doom Soon, about a trillion people will ever live, and we’re about a tenth of the way through that. 

**[00:09:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h09m57s)**  Doom Late, way more than a million trillion will have lived, and we’d be among the tiny, tiny, tiny fraction that born first. 

**[00:10:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h10m04s)**  Conceptually, Doom Soon, with its trillion people, is like being one of the ten people in our second, numbered door example. 

**[00:10:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h10m11s)**  And Doom Late corresponds to our 100 people in that same example. 

**[00:10:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h10m14s)**  And I already told you that our estimates put you in at about #100 billion on birth order. 

**[00:10:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h10m20s)**  That corresponds to stepping out to see the #7 on your door. 

**[00:10:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h10m23s)**  You are about number #100 billion, so am I, we’ve all stepped out and seen a low number on our door. 

**[00:10:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h10m28s)**  I asked you a little while ago how you felt about seeing door #7, if you felt that made it more likely you were part of that 10 room group than the 100 room group. 

**[00:10:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h10m37s)**  If you did feel that was sound reasoning, and it’s pretty solid, then when you realize you are #100 billion in human race it should seem, on the face of it, that you are way more likely to be part of the Doom Soon group of a round a trillion not the Doom Late group of a million trillion and way more. 

**[00:10:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h10m52s)**  I mean in one case it’s like finding out that for a conference of ten people you randomly arrived first, and in the other, I would say it would be like finding out that you randomly arrived first in an entire stadium except that barely even begins to describe the level of improbability of having been born this early in even the most conservatively small interstellar civilizations. 

**[00:11:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h11m13s)**  That would be more akin to the odds winning the lottery several weeks in a row. 

**[00:11:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h11m17s)**  Only you didn’t win, you kind of lost. 

**[00:11:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h11m20s)**  Most of us would rather have been born nowadays then in ancient times when life was a lot harder and a lot shorter on average. 

**[00:11:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h11m26s)**  And as we discussed in the Transhumanism and Immortality video, and how most of us who are techno-optimists tend to feel, being born further ahead in time would probably be better. 

**[00:11:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h11m36s)**  That was one of our lines of reasoning against the Simulation Hypothesis last time, where we were faced with similar super huge odds that faced us with the high improbability we are the people actually lived through modern times rather than being Ancestor Simulation, that advanced civilizations might feel it was unethical to subjects us to these primitive and harsh modern times. 

**[00:11:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h11m56s)**  But keep this in mind, in the Doom Late Group, you are trying to argue that of all the people in their near endless trillions who will ever live you and I just happened by freak luck to have been born in that first fraction of that first trillion. 

**[00:12:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h12m09s)**  Whereas in the Doom Soon Group we’re not even arguing we’re in the first half. 

**[00:12:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h12m14s)**  A lot of times on the Doomsday Argument, when people roll through the math and get that 1-2 trillion figure, they misinterpret that as meaning that is how many people will live, when what it is actually saying is that the most people who could live before the odds start getting ridiculous, the odds favor it would happen a lot sooner, probably in the next 100 billion people since there have been 100 billion so far, and at current birth rates of 131 million a year, that would be about the 28th century, sooner if the birth rate went up. 

**[00:12:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h12m44s)**  Now while that’s sinking in let me walk you through a statistical example. 

**[00:12:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h12m48s)**  Some groups of experts has calculated that there’s a 1% chance of us all being killed each year. 

**[00:12:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h12m53s)**  For our purposes, doesn’t matter which, it could be nuclear war, a lot of people thought 1% would have been generous during the Cold War. 

**[00:13:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h13m01s)**  Asteroids or some new doomsday device that got the diagram leaked all over the internet and can be built by anyone with decent skill and a few thousands bucks, or some designer virus or plague, ebola’s big brother. 

**[00:13:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h13m12s)**  Doesn’t matter. 

**[00:13:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h13m13s)**  Their spokesman goes before a congressional committee and say “1%, every year, a 1% chance we’ll be dead each year.” So the oversight committee chair says, “Hey wait, are you telling me there’s a 1% chance we’re going to die every year? 

**[00:13:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h13m28s)**  That means there’s a 50/50 chance we’ll all be dead in 50 years.” And another committee person says, “And either way we’ll be dead in a century. 

**[00:13:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h13m36s)**  1% a year, 100 years, gone.” Now at this point the testifying expert says, “No sir, I’m saying there’s a fifty-fifty chance of this happening in about the next 70 years, odds don’t add up that way. 

**[00:13:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h13m47s)**  There’s a 99% chance, or .99 chance, of us surviving every year so the odds of us surviving 50 years wouldn’t be 50%, it would be .99^50, or 60.5%, it doesn’t drop to 50% for 69 years, .99^69 is about 50%, so 69 call it 70 years, a whole human lifetime. 

**[00:14:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h14m10s)**  Now in full 100 years it’s .99^100, or .366, or 36.6% we’ll still be alive and 63.4% we’ll be dead, not 100%, it will never be 100%.” “Well I’m a gambling man.” Says one of the committee, “How long before it drops to just 1%?” “Well that would be logarithm in base .99 of .01, which would be about 458 years. 

**[00:14:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h14m37s)**  It drops to 1 in 1000, or .001, in log base .99 of .001 687, and if you want lottery odds of 1 in 10 million sir, even that would only be 1600 years.” We have a statistical concept for degree of belief, or certainty. 

**[00:14:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h14m54s)**  It’s like when you see all those polls that say something like 52-48% for some pair of candidates and at the bottom it says +/-3%. 

**[00:15:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h15m03s)**  Someone’s says the one candidate is up 4 points, but they’re actually in a statistical tie. 

**[00:15:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h15m09s)**  Because they could be separated as much as 55-45 or it could got the other way and be as low as 49-51. 

**[00:15:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h15m15s)**  But it could also be outside that window, that margin, for error. 

**[00:15:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h15m20s)**  Usually we use a 95% confidence level for such margins, meaning 19 out of 20 times the result will be in that 3% window, but 1 in 20 it won’t be. 

**[00:15:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h15m31s)**  95% is a pretty common pick, and is one of the reason on many older Doomsday argument write-ups you’d see 1.2 trillion, they were using an older estimate for humans who had ever lived of 60 billion, newer estimate is 108 billion, and multiplying 60 by 20 would give you 1.2 trillion. 

**[00:15:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h15m47s)**  In our last example there, the 1% a year chance, to get up to 95% where there’s only be a 5% chance we’d still be alive, would take 300 years. 

**[00:15:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h15m57s)**  I could say I was 95% certain we’d be dead in 300 years. 

**[00:16:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h16m01s)**  Doesn’t mean we have that long. 

**[00:16:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h16m03s)**  Could be shorter, could be longer, but not a lot longer because the odds of survival keep plummeting, going from 1 in 2 in 70 years to 1 in 20 in 300 years to 1 in 100 in 460 years to 1 in 1000 in 700 years and only 1 in million in 1600 years. 

**[00:16:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h16m20s)**  If I asked most people if they thought there was a 1% chance we’d kill ourselves off in the next year, I’d wager I’d get about an even mix of folks who nodded and said that was about right with folks who thought it was being generous and ones who thought it was pessimistic on our survival. 

**[00:16:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h16m33s)**  So coupled to the Doomsday Argument that you were randomly born in time and its improbably you were born very early, this is a pretty strong probabilistic argument. 

**[00:16:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h16m42s)**  You weren’t born early, you didn’t get bad luck to born at the very dawn of mankind because it won’t sprawl out into an empire over a billion suns lasting for billions of years. 

**[00:16:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h16m52s)**  You were probably born right around the middle of the group, maybe tilted a bit early, maybe a bit late, but not improbably so, and the end is coming not that long off. 

**[00:17:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h17m01s)**  Now if you picked that seeing door #7 meant you were probably one of ten people and not a hundred, from earlier, that doesn’t mean you are stuck with the Doomsday Argument. 

**[00:17:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h17m09s)**  And most people hate the Doomsday Argument, I do, but if you dislike it is important to make sure your reasoning is on solid footing, we don’t discard a logical sound premise because it is distasteful and it is pretty logical sound. 

**[00:17:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h17m22s)**  Fortunately there are counter-arguments, many of them, some good, some bad, some close to home, we’ll just cover a few. 

**[00:17:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h17m30s)**  For instance, in the Transhumanism video we are constantly talking about post-human states and immortality too. 

**[00:17:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h17m36s)**  You could argue post-human isn’t human, that cyborgs or digital people or some souped up Strong AI planet sized computer brain is not a human, I’d argue otherwise but it’s not a bad notion, and so the Doomsday Argument would hold even though we kept on going in a way after that. 

**[00:17:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h17m52s)**  And with genuine immortality, since there are only finite resources, birth rates could drop to a trickle or stop entirely as those immortals decided they wanted to keep all remaining matter and energy for their own continued existence, and only replace the few rare deaths or not even that, just dividing up the deceased’s stockpiles for themselves, so they could keep going even longer. 

**[00:18:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h18m12s)**  The flip side of that, you could say that if a transhuman or post-human is a human, then maybe our 108 billion estimate for people born thus far is being unfair, and we are excluding a lot of proto-humans or even other primates and dolphins and elephants or maybe even wider, back to first critters, many millions if not billions of extra years for births and including a lot more from each year too. 

**[00:18:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h18m33s)**  Also, as I’ve indicated, the Anthropic Principle, the Doomsday Argument, and the Simulation Hypothesis are often linked up together, and for good reason. 

**[00:18:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h18m42s)**  Consider the Simulation Hypothesis we discussed last time, inside that we don’t know our Birth Order, our real Birth Order, at all. 

**[00:18:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h18m49s)**  Sure the original folks of the 21st century were ranked around 100 billion but for all we know we could be ancestor simulations running around the real year 4 Billion AD, keeping some last immortal company while he sticks around to watch the sun die, last dude still kicking around from the original 21st century and he keeps replaying it, and we’re not birth order 100 billion, we’re somewhere up in the gajillions and just don’t know it. 

**[00:19:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h19m13s)**  We’re in his version of Groundhog day. 

**[00:19:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h19m15s)**  We also don’t know that there will be a finite number of humans, we tend to assume so but at the same time most of us tend to think the Universe, I mean the whole thing, every place be it alternate universes or alternate dimensions or whatever, the whole grand shebang if you would, is infinite in size and duration. 

**[00:19:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h19m30s)**  And if that were the case there would be an infinite number of places we could call home and if we had a way of getting there, you could have an infinite number of people. 

**[00:19:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h19m39s)**  Counter-intuitively, like with the St. Petersburg Paradox, while an incredibly large number of humans as in the Doom Late Group would imply it was improbable we were born this early, an infinite number of people doesn’t make it improbable at all. 

**[00:19:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h19m52s)**  If there’s an infinite number of us then you are genuinely as likely to be born whenever in the order. 

**[00:19:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h19m57s)**  Another, and one a bit similar, goes back to the Self-Indication Assumption. 

**[00:20:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h20m01s)**  Near the beginning, when I set up the reasoning that if you were on that list of 110 people, 10 of whom had even odds to be in 10 rooms and 100 of whom had even odds be in 100 rooms, says that you are far more likely to have been in that group of 100 people. 

**[00:20:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h20m14s)**  And from that, if there are a ton of people, as in the Doom Late version with our trillions of trillions of people, you actually more likely to exist if there were a huge number of us, and so are more likely to exist in a universe in which there were a huge number of us, a Doom Late Universe, then in one in which few of us existed, the Doom Soon Universe. 

**[00:20:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h20m33s)**  Yes it is statistically improbable to be born early in a Doom Late Universe, but it would also be statistically improbable to be born into a Doom Soon Universe not a Doom Late one, since there are so many more people you can be in that one, so it kinda cancels out. 

**[00:20:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h20m47s)**  The self-indication assumption, SIA, along with the Self-Sampling Assumption, SSA, can be looked at a bit more clearly in the Sleeping Beauty Problem, as I mentioned earlier, but I’m opting not to cover that in detail today, because I’ve noticed I tend not to be great at explaining that. 

**[00:21:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h21m02s)**  Probably because I tilt heavily towards SIA and am a ‘Thirder’, the enemy camp to the ‘Halfers’ on the Sleeping Beauty Problem, so I think I pre-bias my explanations. 

**[00:21:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h21m12s)**  Also like Bostrom, who came up with a third position known as SSSA, Strong Self-Sampling Assumption, I feel SSA needs to take into account some other things. 

**[00:21:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h21m22s)**  If you do spend some time on the Sleeping Beauty Problem, after you’ve absorbed it, try contemplate it for scenarios where the experiment doesn’t end after day two but just keeps going on, or where you are using tons of clones who all begin with the same memory of events prior to the experiment beginning. 

**[00:21:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h21m37s)**  That can be a bit unnerving as you let your mind dwell on it though, as we just keep drugging someone and erasing their memory, demanding to know how likely they think this is the first time they’ve been woken up, or replace the scenario and question with tons of copies of a person and ask them how likely they think it is they are the original, especially if you’ve already gone through the simulation hypothesis video. 

**[00:21:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h21m57s)**  Now there a plenty more objections but I’d rather you pushed the idea around in your head more before looking at those, the one’s I just covered relate to our recent topics so I wanted to cover them. 

**[00:22:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h22m05s)**  And one more, we’ve talked a lot about the Fermi Paradox on this channel and this video is in that context but I haven’t mentioned it much in this video, and yet it does have a specific place. 

**[00:22:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h22m15s)**  Now you’re probably assuming that’s as a solution, that the Doomsday Argument applies to alien civilizations as much as to ourselves and that suggest alien civilizations don’t last long and for that reason we don’t detect them. 

**[00:22:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h22m27s)**  And that’s how it often does get viewed, but there is an additional implication. 

**[00:22:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h22m31s)**  If you extend your Self-Sampling Assumption to include all intelligent beings, not just humans, which is to say you could have been born an alien, and we assume aliens are reasonably common, then our birth order number approach begins to fall apart, much as it did when I suggested including our pre-human ancestors or other smart animals like chimpanzees and dolphins. 

**[00:22:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h22m51s)**  And that seems a nice fix since it means your birth wasn’t really improbable, there were probably clever aliens born billions of years ago. 

**[00:22:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h22m57s)**  However, and especially in the context of the Dyson Dilemma, it still raises some Fermi Paradox problems because if we do assume intelligent civilizations are prone to expanding outward and building Dyson Swarms around everything, we’d still have to assume that since this hasn’t happened yet, and since we are actually quite early in the Universe’s Star Forming age which itself pretty short compared to the ages which could follow when life could still be going on, we would still be confronted with the freakish odds of being born this early, only now they are ratcheted up as we are not just considering all possible humans who will ever exist, but also possible intelligent being show will ever exist. 

**[00:23:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h23m35s)**  So that’s where we’ll wrap it up for today, hopefully you’ve got some fun new concepts and ideas to mull around and better understand this argument, it’s strengths, and its flaws, and maybe have a new take on coin flips too. 

**[00:23:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h23m46s)**  Speaking of which, there’s about coin flips odds I’ll be skipping next week’s video for time constraints. 

**[00:23:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h23m51s)**  If I don’t it will probably be to do one of our shorter upcoming topics, if I do one of the longer ones, so I won’t say what the next video will be yet. 

**[00:23:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NQIB3-EtL1w&t=00h23m59s)**  If you haven’t already watched them, I’d suggest going back and watching the videos on Transhumanism and the Simulation Hypothesis, or you can try out any of these videos playlists.
