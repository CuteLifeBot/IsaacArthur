**[00:00:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ofD5kPySuvE&t=00h00m06s)**  We explore concepts like the Fermi paradox, exoplanets, terraforming alien planets or blowing them up. 

**[00:00:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ofD5kPySuvE&t=00h00m13s)**  Giant megastructures too big to even fit on a planet and ideas like mind uploading and simulated realities or living around black holes in the distant future, interstellar colonization, arcologies and planet wide cities. Alien civilizations and artificial planets are just some of the many topics we look at here.
