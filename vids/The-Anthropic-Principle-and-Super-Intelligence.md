This was an unplanned video and the first time we’ve left the scheduled queue in a while but I felt there were some topics we either didn’t cover or didn’t cover in sufficient details in the last few videos, which formed a loose trilogy, and were themselves meant to answer some questions we’d be raising in other videos but had to skim past. 

**[00:00:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h00m28s)**  There’s also some channel updates this week, so while the material today is going to be presented in as reasonably complete and standalone fashion as possible this is probably not the best video to begin with if this is your first visit to the channel and you probably ought to click on the video link to go back to the original video in this set and start there. 

**[00:00:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h00m46s)**  If you’re sticking around anyway, you probably should turn on the closed caption subtitles, as my voice takes a bit of getting used to and the subtitles help in the meantime. 

**[00:00:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h00m55s)**  Okay our two topics today, which are mostly unrelated but were both connected to our previous set of topics, are the Anthropic Principle and Super-Intelligence. 

**[00:01:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h01m04s)**  The latter is our main focus but I wanted to cover the Anthropic Principle first because while I’ve touched on it briefly in the recent videos I didn’t go into much detail because I didn’t want to distract from the topics that descend from the Anthropic Principle by sidetracking onto it. 

**[00:01:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h01m20s)**  Mostly this is because the Anthropic Principle is itself a fairly difficult concept to cover for a variety of reasons. 

**[00:01:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h01m27s)**  First it is a bit conceptually tricky. 

**[00:01:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h01m30s)**  Second the popular examples people use tend to really predispose people to bias on it. 

**[00:01:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h01m36s)**  And third, it is actually rather hazily defined as a concept. 

**[00:01:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h01m40s)**  All of which makes for a lot of confusion, because people have a tendency to look for something incredibly deep and profound in the Anthropic Principle, which I suppose there is, but much like it’s counterpart, the Copernican Principle or its more modern and generalized form, the Mediocrity Principle, it’s really about how you look at problems when you don’t know much and are encountering apparent improbabilities. 

**[00:02:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h02m02s)**  For the Copernican Principle the example is how we are not the center of the Universe, but there are three popular one for the Anthropic Principle. 

**[00:02:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h02m09s)**  The first is the Doomsday Argument, which created by the same fellow who coined the term Anthropic Principle, Cosmologist Brandon Carter, whose variation of the Anthropic Principle is often called the Weak Anthropic Principle. 

**[00:02:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h02m21s)**  The Second is the Simulation Hypothesis, created by philosopher Nick Bostrom who has done a lot of the work refining the Anthropic Principle, and the third is the Fine Tuned Universe concept, popularized by Cosmologists John Barrow and Frank Tipler in there book the Anthropic Cosmological Principle. 

**[00:02:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h02m38s)**  These are great examples for increasing attention on the topic since they may be summed as basically arguing when the world will end, if we ourselves are real or simulations, and if there is a God. 

**[00:02:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h02m49s)**  Needless to say that captures attention but it’s almost guaranteed to upset folks and bias them on the subject. 

**[00:02:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h02m55s)**  I prefer much more mundane and down to earth examples, but they can be a bit boring, and we covered two of those, Doomsday argument and Simulation Hypothesis, as extensions of the Fermi Paradox so the Anthropic Principle itself wasn’t a main interest at the time. 

**[00:03:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h03m10s)**  I was covering those topics in their own right and in terms of how they fit inside the spectrum of proposed solutions to the Fermi Paradox, not how they descend from the Anthropic Principle. 

**[00:03:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h03m20s)**  Also as I mentioned it’s a bit of hazy concept too. 

**[00:03:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h03m23s)**  Carter has said he regrets giving it that name, it’s a bit misleading since Anthropic means human-centered and that’s not the point, it might be better called the Observer or Egocentric Principle in contrast to the Mediocrity Principle. 

**[00:03:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h03m36s)**  On top of that it was hazily defined initially so many variants exist, Nick Bostrom says he cataloged 30 distinct versions and many were really very off concept. 

**[00:03:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h03m47s)**  Since there is no official definition I have the option of trying to present them all, or at least all the ones with a semi-legitimate claim, which would be needlessly time-consuming, or just present what I view as the proper definition in the context we’ve been using, so that is what I will do, and then we will move on to discuss super-intelligence. 

**[00:04:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h04m05s)**  We apply the Mediocrity and Anthropic Principles all the time at a daily level without even thinking about it, but they’re really about assumptions that should be drawn to make decisions when you don’t know much so the examples used tend to set up virtually no knowledge of the event, and neither view is necessarily going to produce different or more correct final assumptions. 

**[00:04:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h04m23s)**  Here’s two examples of them in mundane life, and in both I think you’ll say ‘no duh, this is obvious’. 

**[00:04:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h04m31s)**  Example #1: Standing in a room I meet twenty people and am informed of their job. 

**[00:04:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h04m36s)**  Ten of them give me fairly broadly random answers like policeman or factory worker or hotel maid or bartender and the like, but ten of them tell me they are insurance salesman. 

**[00:04:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h04m45s)**  What should I conclude from this? 

**[00:04:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h04m47s)**  Now under either Mediocrity or Anthropic Principles I have the option of assuming that I just happened to randomly meet 10 insurance salesman out of a sample of 20 with no underlying cause for the weird distribution, it isn’t that uncommon of a job after all, but they can also both contemplate that there was an underlying cause for the distribution. 

**[00:05:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h05m07s)**  In fact a bunch of you have probably already jumped ahead and concluded I am probably at hotel that is hosting a convention for insurance salesman, and that I, the observer, might be one myself. 

**[00:05:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h05m18s)**  Thus simultaneously explaining the high distribution of the insurance salesmen and my reason for being there to observe it. 

**[00:05:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h05m24s)**  The Mediocrity Principle is mostly about realizing it is convention, whereas the Anthropic Principle is mostly about why I was there to observe it. 

**[00:05:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h05m32s)**  Same if I noticed some room had a hundred cans of corn in it, the mediocrity principle would be focused on places where we would expect that, like a grocery store or survival bunker, while the Anthropic Principle is about why I personally am observing this strange thing, because I’m grocery shopping or visiting a friend who is a survivalist. 

**[00:05:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h05m51s)**  That’s why I said it might be better called the Egocentric Principle instead of the Anthropic Principle. 

**[00:05:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h05m56s)**  Now this doesn’t seem like a terribly profound concept and actually seems rather silly and trivial, something that seems that way for a lot of mathematical, philosophical, and scientific core concepts or assumptions. 

**[00:06:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h06m07s)**  But it’s when you’re operating with very little information that it sticks out because it comes down to decision making. 

**[00:06:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h06m13s)**  So let’s highlight that with example #2. 

**[00:06:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h06m16s)**  Example #2: I have been handed many sheets of paper each having a list of ten movies on them and the heading ‘favorite films’. 

**[00:06:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h06m24s)**  Each of the lists is unique but there are many similarities and far too many for me to think it very likely this represents a random distribution of films, or even popular films. 

**[00:06:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h06m35s)**  How should I proceed? 

**[00:06:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h06m36s)**  The Mediocrity approach would be to look at those similarities and to assume they are probably a random sample of a fairly mundane and mediocre nature from the group of people who wrote them, and that those folks represent a subset of humanity that is inclined to those films. 

**[00:06:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h06m51s)**  The Anthropic approach would be to assume that my presence here to see those lists in the first place is indicative and I would jot down my own list of ten favorites believing that it will help me draw conclusions. 

**[00:07:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h07m02s)**  And depending on the actual circumstances one of these approaches is more likely to be a good path. 

**[00:07:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h07m08s)**  For instance on this channel I often get asked in the comments section what my favorite films or TV shows or books are and no surprise that when I list them I often get replies that many of those are their own favorites. 

**[00:07:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h07m20s)**  And it is no surprise, I am a science fiction fan and so is a lot of the audience and that is very related to the channel. 

**[00:07:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h07m27s)**  So my ability to observe those list of favorites, or your ability to observe them now, is indeed very related to your existence. 

**[00:07:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h07m35s)**  Alternatively if we polled this channel for favorite foods we wouldn’t really expect to see abnormally high preferences in relation to the human population as a whole, though it might skew by geographic region or other factors. 

**[00:07:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h07m48s)**  To underscore it, these two concepts are not in opposition, and you use them all the time, but circumstances tend to dictate which is good for what and reduce it to a simple and common mental exercise. 

**[00:08:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h08m01s)**  And a bit of boring one. 

**[00:08:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h08m02s)**  When we know very little and pick topics like the End of the World or if God Exists or if you might actually be a simulation on a computer it can provoke deeper interest to contemplate the idea but also tends to obscure what is a both simple and profound tool for making decisions. 

**[00:08:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h08m18s)**  To segue way into our second and main topic for today, Super-Intelligence, let me make a comparison to what is known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect or Curve. 

**[00:08:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h08m28s)**  If we plot a person’s confidence on a subject or problem against what they know about it we get this sort of double hump. 

**[00:08:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h08m35s)**  Initially confidence is low but rises steeply, then drops off as they learn more before rising again. 

**[00:08:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h08m41s)**  Now I often call this first curve’s top the “Peak of Mount Stupid” and it does seem to be a popular vacation spot, probably one we are all guilty of pitching our tent at on a regular basis. 

**[00:08:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h08m52s)**  However I raise it now to note more how we make decisions. 

**[00:08:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h08m57s)**  Often we can make a very confident decision off very little information and grow less confident as we learn more though eventually learn enough to be more confident in that decision. 

**[00:09:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h09m08s)**  Sometimes learning more can even make us double-guess correct conclusions and make bad ones, but that’s not my point here. 

**[00:09:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h09m15s)**  I keep stressing that the Anthropic Principle is mostly about decision making when you don’t know much, and its about making a decision you can be confident about. 

**[00:09:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h09m24s)**  Not because you think it is very likely to be right, but rather because you think that based on what you know it was the best decision to make. 

**[00:09:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h09m33s)**  If you get more info you can revise, but in the meantime you can decide and act knowing your decision was the right decision to make regardless of if it was wrong. 

**[00:09:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h09m41s)**  If it’s twice as likely to be right as the options, it was the right pick, even if it was a tiny chance. 

**[00:09:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h09m48s)**  If someone is about to roll a pair of dice and you have to guess the sum, you should say 7, not 2 or 12, and certainly not 1 or 100, since 7 is most likely and 2 and 12 least likely and 1 and 100 would seem to be impossible. 

**[00:10:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h10m04s)**  If you later learn that those were not six-sided cubic dice, or aren’t labeled 1-6, or that they are both but weighted to land on sixes a lot, you revise accordingly. 

**[00:10:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h10m14s)**  Now the Dunning-Kruger Curve is applicable to humans when we think about super-intelligence too because it’s important to understand that we all hang out on Mount Stupid because there’s just only so much time in our lives to learn things and only so much interest or need to encourage us to learn various topics. 

**[00:10:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h10m30s)**  And those topics can include things like being a good conversationalist or a convincing speaker. 

**[00:10:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h10m35s)**  Those are learned skills, same as throwing a ball or performing a calculation. 

**[00:10:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h10m40s)**  A super-intelligence, of any of the three forms we’ll be looking at, ought to have a lot more of those skills and so as we approach these notions it’s a good idea to remove the fictional bias we have of thinking of some computer brain or superhuman as displaying all the personal charm of an ice cube tray. 

**[00:10:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h10m57s)**  I mentioned this notion before the Apocalypse How video, that in all probability an artificial intelligence bent on world domination is a lot less likely to do it with legions of killer robots and nukes and probably a lot more likely to be swept into power by popular vote. 

**[00:11:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h11m13s)**  Yes it might use that it can be more impartial and knowledgeable as a selling point but I would genuinely expect a super-intelligence, regardless of its providence, be it a computer mind or a transhuman, to absolutely ooze charisma and charm. 

**[00:11:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h11m27s)**  But what is Super-Intelligence? 

**[00:11:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h11m29s)**  Well Nick Bostrom breaks into 3 loose categories and I’ll borrow his: 1. 

**[00:11:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h11m35s)**  Speed Super-intelligence – Something we discussed before in the Transhumanism video, essentially where the enhanced intelligence is simply in the form of thinking faster. 

**[00:11:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h11m45s)**  This is often the easiest for people to visualize since it is sort of like if the world around you simply slowed down. 

**[00:11:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h11m51s)**  In Computer terms it’s a faster processor. 

**[00:11:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h11m54s)**  2. 

**[00:11:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h11m55s)**  Collective Super-Intelligence – This is probably the type of super-intelligence we’re most familiar with and sort of already have a type of, though it could vary from a very loose collective, like a tribe with specialized skill sets, scaling all the way up to a civilization, or a group of specialists advancing their field together, to more direct high bandwidth collectives where you might argue there’s only one mind and the individuals are more like organs of a body or lobes of the group brain. 

**[00:12:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h12m21s)**  In computer terms this would be multiple processors or networked computers. 

**[00:12:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h12m25s)**  3. 

**[00:12:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h12m27s)**  Quality Super-Intelligence, our last category, is the hardest to visualize except by comparison, in that here we’re not talking about adding faster processors or more processors in parallel but in some way arguable more the software angle. 

**[00:12:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h12m40s)**  A cat with a faster mind probably isn’t going to discover calculus, nor would a hundred cats all linked up in parallel. 

**[00:12:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h12m47s)**  In human terms one trained and talented scientist or artist is going to produce more insights or deeper art in their normal career than one random person who has ten subjective lifetimes to look at the problem or ten random people put together in room as a committee. 

**[00:13:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h13m02s)**  Using that Dunning Kruger Effect one more time, we’d expect the either of these three types to occupy Mount Stupid a lot less, since Speed Super-Intelligence has a lot more time to learn things in, subjectively, and can research topics in detail a lot faster. 

**[00:13:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h13m17s)**  Collective Super-Intelligence just has the two heads are better than one advantage, meaning talking to it would be akin to asking a room full of random people about something instead of just one random person, and Quality Super-Intelligence is akin to asking an expert rather than a random person. 

**[00:13:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h13m32s)**  Now as I said we did talk about Speed Super-Intelligence back in the Transhumanism video and we’ll just briefly mention the highlights of that and some new stuff relevant to it today. 

**[00:13:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h13m41s)**  A speed super-intelligence is basically where you’re taking a human brain and speeding it up, either by miniaturizing it so signals move faster or replacing the existing biology with mechanisms that transmit faster. 

**[00:13:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h13m53s)**  Human though basically moves at the speed of sound or slower, whereas you could presumably ramp that all the way up to the speed of light which is some millions of times faster. 

**[00:14:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h14m01s)**  From a practical standpoint you just live longer in a Universe where time seems to move past much slower, your subjective time is running way faster. 

**[00:14:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h14m11s)**  You’re not smarter, but you’ve got a lot more time to reply to comments or react to events or think about things. 

**[00:14:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h14m17s)**  Of course since your mind is wired to receive information from your eyes and ears and so on at a certain speed and bandwidth you’ve got to modify that person rather extensively to be able to, for instance, mentally connect to the internet and be able to chat with other accelerated individuals by the equivalent of telepathy, presumably radio communication, and a lot of times we’d assume they abandon a natural body or use it as just one piece of their existence since it will be too slow, even if we replace it with some cyborg chassis that can move at bullet speed. 

**[00:14:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h14m46s)**  You’d sort of expect these folks would want to move in together too since living in the same building with other accelerated individuals means no time lag on talking, and while we don’t even notice the fraction of a second it takes a signal to cross the planet, for them even a phone call to someone in the town next door might feel like it would be for us trying to talk to astronauts on Mars where there’s several minutes of lag time after you say something before the other guy here’s it and just as much before you get their response. 

**[00:15:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h15m13s)**  We do carry on conversations with long lag by email for instance, often even when we know we can dial the phone a lot faster than we can type the reply and get an instant answer, but it isn’t the way we like to chat. 

**[00:15:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h15m26s)**  Now the second category, Collective Super-Intelligence, is in some ways something you are already familiar with. 

**[00:15:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h15m32s)**  Group action effectively creates a new entity, very literally if we’re talking about multi-cellular life or colony organisms or even hive minds, and more metaphorically if we’re talking about teams or clubs or tribes or packs or herds. 

**[00:15:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h15m46s)**  You and I both are part of multiple collective super-intelligences, albeit if fairly primitive ones in this light, but groups and civilizations themselves are essentially big problem solving entities. 

**[00:15:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h15m58s)**  This is a very broad category then since it can range from existing human groups exchanging thought by low bandwidth speech up to something where we wired peoples brains together so closely that they might be better thought of as being hemispheres or lobes of some larger brain. 

**[00:16:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h16m15s)**  From the two heads are better than one approach to the full blown hive mind or even more reintegrated equivalent to a multi-cellular organism with only one meaningful personality and identity. 

**[00:16:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h16m25s)**  And this would contain the idea of the networked computer mind that explodes into consciousness at some critical mass, Google gone sentient as it were. 

**[00:16:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h16m33s)**  Familiar concept, though I’d add a backwards case of this for contemplation before we move into the third category. 

**[00:16:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h16m39s)**  We have all noted, in ourselves or in a friend, a tendency to wear different masks with different people or groups. 

**[00:16:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h16m46s)**  Now that can indicate a certain amount of fakeness and fabrication to that person’s identity but I’m referring to the fairly mundane way many of change behaviors and even tone and mannerism around others. 

**[00:16:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h16m57s)**  This can be a fairly deep transition too, in more than just surface detail. 

**[00:17:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h17m01s)**  It can verge on an almost mild equivalent to multiple personality disorder and so I can imagine how an upgraded singular intelligence might actually break off fairly distinct bits to handle this or that task or interaction in a backwards case of collective intelligence or parallel processing, but is more of a software than hardware approach, sort of multitasking, multiple windows open, but in a more distinct way like when a computer’s processor does the job of a sound or video card rather than having separate devices for that. 

**[00:17:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h17m32s)**  Using that Google analogy, since we’d often expect AI to spring from something like a search engine that had a lot interaction with tons of different users, I could imagine a huge AI that had tons of customized interfaces for dealing with certain user personalities or even on unique to each user. 

**[00:17:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h17m50s)**  Now Speed Super-Intelligence lets you think faster and collective Super-intelligence let’s you put more minds on a problem and both are very handy things for problem solving but we’d say there is a type of intelligence that handles some problems in just a plain better way. 

**[00:18:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h18m06s)**  In the way ten people might take years or forever to figure out the answer to something when one person of the right mind can walk in and just figure it out with ease, or how one person might spend years trying to write a decent book and other could churn out a superior volume in a few weeks. 

**[00:18:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h18m22s)**  This is a very hazy an indistinct type of intelligence and we call it Quality Intelligence. 

**[00:18:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h18m28s)**  And I use the analogy that it essentially a software thing. 

**[00:18:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h18m31s)**  Partially because I tend to be kind of dubious on the idea of genius to begin with. 

**[00:18:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h18m35s)**  I regard intelligence levels among humans, as well as genius and talent, as mostly matters of development and focus, both in the software sense of experiences and knowledge and a bit of a muscle analogy that you’ve got to exercise the brain to build and keep all those neural connections. 

**[00:18:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h18m52s)**  There are several competing theories for human intelligence, Gardenr’s theory of multiple intelligence that breaks it down into categories like special, linguistic, logical-mathematical, interpersonal and a few others is a popular one. 

**[00:19:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h19m05s)**  There’s also Sternberg’s Triarchic Intelligence, or Successful Intelligence, that breaks it into Analytic, Creative, and Practical Intelligence. 

**[00:19:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h19m14s)**  We’ve also got Fluid Intelligence versus Crystalized Intelligence that looks at Fluid Intelligence as someone’s problem solving skills independent of their knowledge whereas Crystallized Intelligence is what handles skills and experience, and there are at least a dozen others. 

**[00:19:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h19m29s)**  I am not personally aware of any of them being considered by the experts on this subject as a strong lead candidate, and I suspect that besides us just not knowing enough yet that we also need to mistrust some of the conclusions as possibly tainted by bias. 

**[00:19:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h19m43s)**  Both in the sense that the people doing the research are likely to assume they are intelligent, with good cause but possible bias as a result, and the understandable tendency for us to want everyone to be intelligent in their own way. 

**[00:19:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h19m55s)**  I’ve no idea how much either bias effects conclusions, hopefully minimally but it certainly biases us non-experts and we need to be cautious when thinking about Quality Intelligence to keep in mind that it might be in whole or part just things we could chalk up to faster processor or more processors or more memory and knowledge and experience and better methodology, or software, developed in the process. 

**[00:20:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h20m20s)**  Ya know you might flick on some computer megabrain who can figure things out we can’t even with more time or people thrown at the problem and it might just turn around and explain its reasoning and we slap ourselves on the forehead and go ‘That is so obvious’ and can then replicate the same feats of intellect albeit slower or needing more heads involved. 

**[00:20:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h20m38s)**  Or it might be that we’d genuinely need or memories expanded so we could think about a lot more things at once, we’re pretty good multi-taskers but there is an actual limit to how many things we can think about or keep track of at once and being able to tinker with that might be the single biggest improvement to intelligence from a quality perspective. 

**[00:20:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h20m58s)**  Okay that’s where we’ll wrap that up, and move into the channel update. 

**[00:21:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h21m02s)**  I’ve got the date up on the screen when I did this so if that is a long while ago or if you’re brand new to the channel you can probably jump ship here, if the latter I suggest going back and watching that trio of recent vids I mentioned and you can click on the box to go to that now, or you can try out these other video playlists. 

**[00:21:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h21m21s)**  In terms of announcements, as the regular viewers know I missed last week’s video, got rather busy with other matters but it broke our weekly schedule that I’d held to for 15 weeks straight. 

**[00:21:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h21m31s)**  I’m rather surprised I went that long uninterrupted and I’ve always said I didn’t expect to keep up that pace though I’ve no intent of returning to the once a month or even less frequent posting form before then. 

**[00:21:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h21m41s)**  Part of the reason though was also that I’ve been kicking around changes to the channel. 

**[00:21:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h21m46s)**  I mentioned some months back that I still didn’t really know where the channel was going and I regret to say I still don’t, especially in light of the wave of copyright claims I’ve been getting hit with, all of which so far I’ve won but those have been getting more numerous and exhausting to deal with. 

**[00:22:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h22m00s)**  So I’ve been pondering starting a website or changing the channel name to something besides my own or asking for some help from the audience since there’s a ton of skill kicking around the channel, and quite a few generous offers to do everything from voice-overs to helping out with the graphics to admin-ing a forum, and I haven’t really figured out the right method yet. 

**[00:22:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h22m18s)**  Heck I still haven’t figured our Reddit. 

**[00:22:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h22m20s)**  I did, after some of the first copyrights claims slapped ads on to my videos and I got tired of Youtube promising all sorts of new tools if I did so myself, put adds on the front of the videos, those should just be those little banner ads and I always leave the lower third of the video fairly content free to make room for subtitles anyway. 

**[00:22:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h22m37s)**  And there is also now a Patreon account for the channel and I’ll leave the link in the video description but I’m still not really sure how to use that. 

**[00:22:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h22m45s)**  Patreon suggests having rewards for patrons but the only one I can think of is just offering to include them in the credits at the end, which normally just has me listed as the sole production credit followed by the list of songs and artists used so adding in the donors, assuming they want that, seems a pretty fair thing and would fit in well if I start needing to add to those credits to also thank folks who are volunteering art to use in the videos or admin-ing a forum or whatever. 

**[00:23:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h23m10s)**  Thing is at the moment I genuinely have no idea what the right path is and researching it further just takes time away from making videos, not too mention answering questions and comments – which I not only consider a necessary and proper addition to the videos but happen to enjoy. 

**[00:23:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h23m25s)**  I should probably add though that the sheer volume of questions that comes in these days which will presumably only grow is making it harder for me to reply to a lot of them so while in the past I usually would answer the same question from someone else I’d already answered below I’d encourage folks to scan those comments before asking, in case I already answered it, or to reply to them and let them know I already had. 

**[00:23:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h23m46s)**  That’s another reason I’m pondering some sort of website or forum, I’d really like to be able to add FAQs onto videos or pin up diagrams or images contained in them or that I wished I’d added, or to be able add on some quick follow up that was less scripted and graphic intensive, B-sides as it were, if I felt something got left out or just wanted to go into more detail on something. 

**[00:24:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h24m07s)**  I’ve also always wanted to encourage other people to try their hand at making videos, it’s a wonderful medium with not too sharp of a learning curve, and I like the idea of being able to give people a bit of jumpstart on that or help those with some useful production or art skills to hook up together on projects. 

**[00:24:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h24m22s)**  I’d love to snatch a few such individuals myself and doubtless will but when you see talent I think you’ve got an obligation to help them get their own projects rolling not just lash them to your own and suck the energy out of them. 

**[00:24:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h24m34s)**  But again as I said I’m not really sure what the best route on all this is, and since we’ve just been talking about collective intelligence I’d greatly appreciate hearing some ideas down in the comments below. 

**[00:24:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h24m44s)**  You can private message me if your prefer but I’d rather mostly do it in the comments so we can get group feedback, plus Youtube’s internal private message system seems to either lose messages or delay notification, so its almost easier to just look me up on Facebook, though I should probably open up a separate FB account for the channel too. 

**[00:25:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h25m02s)**  There’s no Twitter, I probably should figure out how to use that too. 

**[00:25:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h25m06s)**  So again at this time I need ideas for what should be done as much as I need help actually doing it, if you’ve got some ideas or want to volunteer your time let me know. 

**[00:25:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h25m16s)**  We’ve got such a great community here that’s been developing in recent months that I hate the idea of not doing something fun and interesting with it. 

**[00:25:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h25m23s)**  Obviously as things develop I’ll mention it in the videos for now, as with last time I’m not sure if there will be a video next week or another skip so I won’t announce which will be up next or do a poll on that, but I am still aiming for primarily once-a-week production with releases on Fridays and once I pick a direction and implement it the pace should return to that. 

**[00:25:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OUf-QXDJgF8&t=00h25m43s)**  That’s it for now, hope you enjoyed the video, thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next time.
