There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable So today we will be looking at a number of the models predicting the eventual fate of the Universe. 

**[00:00:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h00m35s)**  As you can imagine this is fairly complex topic so we will be joined today Dr. Paul M. Sutter, an Astrophysicist with Ohio State University. 

**[00:00:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h00m44s)**  It is also quite a long topic so this will be a two part episode, and you can watch part 2 over on Paul’s channel, which also an excellent place to visit to learn more about cosmology in general. 

**[00:00:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h00m57s)**  To discuss the End of the Universe we might as well start with the beginning, both where it came from and how human thought on this matter has evolved as we learned more. 

**[00:01:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h01m07s)**  The Big Bang theory was proposed almost a century ago and has solidified its status since then, but people have been thinking about the origin of the Universe for at least as long as we have had recorded history. 

**[00:01:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h01m18s)**  They obviously didn’t have the same resources we have nowadays but typically drew three basic conclusions that remained popular up to modern times. 

**[00:01:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h01m28s)**  Since the world around them could be seen to change on a daily basis, but not necessarily all that much or significantly, they tended to conclude either the Universe at one point did not exist, or it has always existed and changes are cyclical, like the sunrise or turning of seasons, or that at the grand scale it pretty much doesn’t change at all. 

**[00:01:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h01m48s)**  Which is to say, snow may fall or melt on a mountain, trees might grow on it and die, but the mountain is unchanged and so is the world it sits on. 

**[00:01:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h01m57s)**  It’s easy for us to look back to antiquity and how little they knew about science and dismiss their thoughts on this topic, but it still lays out the conversation we’ve had in more modern times and are still discussing. 

**[00:02:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h02m09s)**  If the Universe began, then how did that happen, who acted or what occurred to make that happen, and what came before? 

**[00:02:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h02m17s)**  If there was something before, was it like now and are we just repeating things in an endless cycle like the seasons? 

**[00:02:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h02m23s)**  And if it has always been around, how is it getting renewed? 

**[00:02:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h02m27s)**  Because you can look at a forest on a mountain changing and say it changes but the mountain does not, but eventually you’ll notice that mountains get eroded. 

**[00:02:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h02m35s)**  Rain comes down and washes dirt away, and while you can see water evaporate and rise into clouds, you can also see rocks tumble down a mountain but never float back up. 

**[00:02:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h02m45s)**  Talking about how things began inevitably leads to asking how they will end. 

**[00:02:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h02m50s)**  Will everything just keep being renewed constantly or reset in some cycles or just wear down one day? 

**[00:02:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h02m56s)**  Needless to say folks had a lot of notions for how things would begin and end, and they did tend to fit into one of those three options even if the specific theory was that Earth was a disc riding around on the back of turtle shell or elephants. 

**[00:03:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h03m10s)**  With the emergence of formal logic and philosophy we got quite a few appearing. 

**[00:03:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h03m14s)**  Aristotle suggested that the Universe was finite in size, centered on Earth, but infinite in time. 

**[00:03:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h03m21s)**  This geocentric model would later be refined by Ptolemy and stick around till Copernicus, though even in Aristotle’s time a heliocentric model had emerged from Aristarchus, and interestingly Archimedes had calculated the Universe to be a light year in radius. 

**[00:03:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h03m36s)**  It is of course far larger than that, but it’s worth remembering how shockingly huge that is. 

**[00:03:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h03m42s)**  Archimedes had no idea what speed light traveled at, but he knew how big that distance he’d calculated was and it meant he thought the Universe was a billion times wider than the planet and contained a billion, billion, billion times the volume. 

**[00:03:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h03m57s)**  We now know it’s at least several billion times wider than even that but it meant even then they’d come to realize just how tiny Earth was, even if they gave it center stage. 

**[00:04:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h04m06s)**  This doesn’t get covered much but it should be, as Archimedes calculation of this in his paper “The Sand Reckoner” is considered to be the first research-expository paper, and actually used Aristarchus heliocentric model. 

**[00:04:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h04m20s)**  We knew the Sun moved in the sky, as did the planets, that’s the origin of their name as planet means wanderer. 

**[00:04:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h04m27s)**  We also had discovered the concept of parallax by then and the stars didn’t seem to experience it. 

**[00:04:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h04m33s)**  Indeed it would be 2000 years before Friedrich Bessel first successfully measured the parallax of a star in 1838. 

**[00:04:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h04m40s)**  Archimedes, Aristotle, Ptolemy and Aristarchus were all wrong of course, but Copernicus wasn’t actually right, and indeed since we can see equally far in all directions, the Observable Universe is actually centered on Earth and geocentric...but that’s a fairly irrelevant status. 

**[00:04:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h04m59s)**  Every observer is centered in their observable bubble. 

**[00:05:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h05m02s)**  We don’t want to get in the habit of thinking though that Copernicus was smart and right and arguing that his predecessors and opponents were stupid and wrong, rather they were quite smart too and Copernicus was just less wrong. 

**[00:05:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h05m17s)**  As we go through these theories, which each radically alter how we viewed the Universe as we got some new piece of evidence, only to be replaced sometime later as we got new Evidence, we do not want to view the advocates of the previous theories as drooling morons arguing against the clear illuminating light of reason and evidence. 

**[00:05:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h05m39s)**  So prior to Copernicus the main theory was the Universe was infinite in age, or if not had been created at some point more or less as it was now and would continue on as it was, but also finite if huge in size (although nowhere as big as we currently understand it). 

**[00:05:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h05m57s)**  Over the next century his modified form of this started catching on but took a hit when Newton’s Law of Universal Gravity both cemented the heliocentric model - providing a mechanism to explain the motion of the planets - but also kind of killed it. 

**[00:06:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h06m14s)**  If every body in the universe exerts gravity on each other, then they ought to fall together over time, and needless to say if the Universe was infinitely old there’s been more than time enough for that. 

**[00:06:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h06m25s)**  So from Newton’s work we were faced with four possible solutions. 

**[00:06:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h06m29s)**  First, the Universe is not infinitely old and appeared at some point all spread out and is falling in. 

**[00:06:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h06m36s)**  This gives us a potential Fate of the Universe, backwards of the Big Bang, that it began huge and will end when everything eventually slams together. 

**[00:06:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h06m44s)**  Second, that gravity is not an entirely inverse-square force, but gets even weaker at great distances, so that we are not pulling on those stars. 

**[00:06:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h06m54s)**  Indeed this option has remained a common theory until modern times and we see it in something called MOND, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, one of the popular explanations for Dark Matter until very recently. 

**[00:07:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h07m07s)**  If gravity basically just ceases at some distance, then you don’t have to worry about stars falling together. 

**[00:07:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h07m12s)**  Third, that something is holding those stars from falling together, resisting gravity. 

**[00:07:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h07m18s)**  Akin to the old notion of angels holding them on a celestial sphere, this was never too popular, and amusingly the discovery of Dark Energy pushing the Universe apart makes this the only one of the four interpretations to still have some validity nowadays. 

**[00:07:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h07m32s)**  And fourth, that the Universe is infinite in both age and size, or at least size. 

**[00:07:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h07m39s)**  16th century mathematician and astronomer Thomas Digges first suggested this one, that the stars were not at a fixed distance on a shell but spread out over varying distances all the way out to infinity, what is now called the Static Universe Model. 

**[00:07:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h07m53s)**  He also first noted the Dark Night Sky Paradox, later known as Olber’s Paradox even though Olber wouldn't be born for a couple more centuries. 

**[00:08:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h08m02s)**  If everything is spread out over an infinite volume, then nothing is moving because there’s always more stuff in the opposite direction pulling it that way too. 

**[00:08:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h08m10s)**  This one gained a lot of traction and its main flaw was the aforementioned Olber’s Paradox, which points out that in an infinite Universe any specific direction you look will eventually be obstructed by a star, so the night sky shouldn’t be black with a few lights twinkling in it, but a uniform shade of light, we’d be surrounded by stars and feel like we lived inside a massive sun. 

**[00:08:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h08m32s)**  Indeed, were that the case everybody should be burned to death, and if the Universe were not infinitely old, as Roemer discovered light needed time to travel and its approximate speed in 1676. 

**[00:08:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h08m43s)**  So we could predict the eventual doom of the Universe would be the sky getting brighter and brighter as ever more distant light arrived until we eventually burned to death. 

**[00:08:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h08m53s)**  Each of these perspectives had a lot going for and against it, in the 17th century and onto the 18th. 

**[00:09:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h09m00s)**  As we move into the 19th century though we had a few new developments. 

**[00:09:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h09m04s)**  We had begun to assume stars were not all fixed on some sphere and that Earth did orbit the Sun, so we could use that movement to engage in some very wide parallax measurements. 

**[00:09:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h09m14s)**  As mentioned, Bessel managed to get the first measurement of distance to a star, 61 Cygni, in 1838 and two of his contemporaries, Struve and Henderson, managed to do the same for Vega and Alpha Centauri at about the same time. 

**[00:09:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h09m28s)**  We managed to measure around a hundred more in short order but couldn’t for many others, we can see a lot more stars than that with the naked eye and had telescopes by now, so this inability to measure them told us they were very far away. 

**[00:09:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h09m41s)**  We had another development in this period too, which was thermodynamics. 

**[00:09:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h09m46s)**  Energy is conserved but entropy is not. 

**[00:09:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h09m49s)**  We had no idea what made the stars hot yet, but we knew they were and should be cooling down, and that if they weren’t they were presumably being fueled someway and that fuel should be finite. 

**[00:10:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h10m01s)**  We already had a lot of philosophical arguments for why the Universe couldn’t be infinite in age, but we also had the same problems for why it couldn’t be finite either, but thermodynamics and the speed of light piled on to make this much harder. 

**[00:10:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h10m14s)**  If the Universe is infinite in size and age, then we should be cooked by Olber’s Paradox, and we would need to know what fueled the stars. 

**[00:10:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h10m23s)**  If the stars simply formed hot at some point in the past, then they would eventually cool off and we’d freeze to death at the End of the Universe instead. 

**[00:10:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h10m30s)**  We were starting to get a decent idea how old the Earth was then too. 

**[00:10:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h10m35s)**  This is when we start getting the first formal scientific theories for the beginning and ending of the Universe, as we had to wrangle with these new issues and an increasingly large map of the Universe. 

**[00:10:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h10m46s)**  Keep in mind at this point we had no idea what powered the stars, how old any of them were or that they had different ages, or what galaxies were. 

**[00:10:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h10m56s)**  Everybody knew the problems with the Static Universe model, the one that reasoned the Universe was infinite in size and age, but it was sort of the default because alternatives had many problems too and none had any real evidence. 

**[00:11:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h11m08s)**  Indeed Einstein would offer up a modified form of the Static Universe model in 1917, a decade after he unveiled Special Relativity. 

**[00:11:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h11m16s)**  As mentioned many had thought the Universe might be finite in age but infinite in size, but he went the other way and said it was infinite in age but finite in size. 

**[00:11:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h11m27s)**  This is also when we start seeing folks talk about the universe having curvature or being flat, no surprise since relativity had started the conversation on space and time being curved. 

**[00:11:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h11m37s)**  In a traditional Euclidean Universe, two long parallel lines stretching off to infinity will remain the same distance, like a pair of railroads tracks. 

**[00:11:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h11m46s)**  For all that they look like they’re converging to our eyes, you can walk alongside them and see them remain the exact same distance apart. 

**[00:11:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h11m53s)**  In a non-flat Universe this isn’t true, and they might grow closer together or further apart, even though they are 100% straight. 

**[00:12:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h12m02s)**  That’s not our focus yet and we didn’t know that the Universe was expanding yet either. 

**[00:12:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h12m07s)**  Now what was different that Einstein thought the Universe would be infinite in size but not in time? 

**[00:12:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h12m12s)**  There was no Hubble red shift yet to indicate that after all. 

**[00:12:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h12m16s)**  This is, incidentally, related to what Einstein called his biggest blunder and that was the cosmological constant, a basic energy density or pressure to space, even in total vacuum. 

**[00:12:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h12m28s)**  As mentioned, if the Universe is finite in size then gravity should yank everything together, so if it is finite in size either gravity had to disappear after a certain distance, or the Universe couldn’t be that old and had to start big, or something was pushing them apart. 

**[00:12:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h12m44s)**  We had gotten enough at astronomy by now to be able to see stars pulling on each other with gravity with no indication it was weakening more than Newton said it should, so that seemed out. 

**[00:12:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h12m53s)**  So if it was infinitely old something that had to be pushing those stars apart and that was the ridiculous cosmological constant, his fudge factor and blunder that he dismissed after Hubble expansion was found a decade later. 

**[00:13:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h13m06s)**  We had to bring it back more recently, but will get to that later. 

**[00:13:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h13m10s)**  For Einstein’s version of the Static Universe to be true it need to explain a few things, but we only knew of one at the time he suggested it, and that was entropy. 

**[00:13:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h13m21s)**  Any model suggesting the Universe was infinitely old, had always been and would always be, has to explain why we still have stars and what’s replenishing their fuel. 

**[00:13:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h13m31s)**  Or if not replenishing them, what was producing the matter for new stars and what was happening to the old, cold dead ones, which should otherwise accumulate to fill the whole Universe over infinite time. 

**[00:13:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h13m43s)**  This is hardly a death blow though, since one can assume matter eventually resets, like shuffling a deck of cards will keep further randomizing it, increasing its entropy, but eventually return you to the original state, resetting that entropy. 

**[00:13:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h13m58s)**  And possibly new matter just appeared from nowhere and old matter just slid into nowhere on a regular basis. 

**[00:14:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h14m05s)**  Sounds a bit silly but considering the alternative is that it all just appeared from nowhere at the same time, it’s essentially on the same footing. 

**[00:14:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h14m13s)**  It’s kind of hard to say tons of matter can appear from nowhere at one initial moment but that it can’t do that later on nor the reverse and just disappear. 

**[00:14:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h14m23s)**  The other two flaws came later, one was intergalactic redshift, which came up shortly after this and caused Einstein to abandon the model, and the other was Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which was still about fifty years off. 

**[00:14:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h14m37s)**  Hubble didn’t discover red shift of stars, that had already been noted, some were redshifting, indicating they were moving away, and others were blue-shifting, indicating the reverse. 

**[00:14:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h14m48s)**  What got noticed is that very distant objects, galaxies, were almost all red-shifting and that the further off they were, the more they were. 

**[00:14:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h14m56s)**  This of course was the origin of the Big Bang Theory, since if galaxies are all moving away, and faster the further off they were, that would imply they used to be a lot closer. 

**[00:15:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h15m06s)**  This was the exact opposite of the problem with the Static Universe, which assumed the Universe needed to be bigger in the past if it were not either infinite in size or had some force keeping stars from falling together. 

**[00:15:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h15m18s)**  It’s big rival for quite some time was the Steady State Model that evolved from the Static Universe version. 

**[00:15:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h15m25s)**  They are not the same and folks often incorrectly assume Steady State is the old model that the Big Bang replaced, rather the Steady State model was proposed in 1948, a couple decades after the Big Bang Theory. 

**[00:15:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h15m39s)**  In the Steady State Model we already knew that stars formed and were fueled and died, and we could see that intergalactic red shift. 

**[00:15:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h15m46s)**  So it suggest the fuel for stars is constantly appearing in little bits and pieces, and that the Universe is indeed expanding but remains essentially the same and has always been and will always be. 

**[00:15:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h15m57s)**  That’s not as contradictory as it maybe sounds, in a non-expanding Universe you end up with clutter of dead stars, as new matter appears to make new stars, but if it is constantly expanding than you have new room for stuff to be, and again the notion that single particles of hydrogen are emerging from nowhere is no worse than new bits of space emerging from nowhere constantly, which both Big Bang and Steady State claim happens, or that all that hydrogen emerged in one single flash of a moment. 

**[00:16:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h16m26s)**  Now you might think you’d be able to detect new bits of matter emerging all over the place but keep in mind that our sun has several cubic light years to itself and several billion years of life, so the 10^57 amu of mass, or hydrogen particles, making up a new one would only require 10^40 of them emerge each second and spread over some 10^49 cubic meters, or one appearing every second in a cubic kilometer. 

**[00:16:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h16m53s)**  Needless to say spotting a single hydrogen atom appearing in a cubic kilometer in a given second is not exactly easy to do, especially back then. 

**[00:17:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h17m03s)**  So Big Bang says all the matter appeared at once many billions of years ago but space is constantly expanding, Steady State argues matter is constantly appearing and so is space. 

**[00:17:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h17m13s)**  There’s no problem by the way with an infinite object expanding, twice of infinity is still infinity but it can get bigger, and indeed that’s permitted under the Big Bang too, which just say those parts of the Universe close enough for us to see used to be finite in size or even point-like, we don’t know that the whole Universe might not be infinite in size and might have begun that way too, we just know it’s much bigger than the parts we can see and that those used to be way smaller. 

**[00:17:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h17m41s)**  So throughout the 1940s, and 50s both models were quite popular with scientists. 

**[00:17:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h17m46s)**  The first hard hit to Steady state was the discovery of quasars, which in general are much more common the further from Earth you get, which means they were much more common in the past, they don’t get less common closer to Earth because our region of the Universe had fewer of them, but rather because they are almost all gone these days and we can only see the old ones because the light is just reaching us. 

**[00:18:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h18m10s)**  In the Steady State model the Universe is expanding and gaining new bits of matter but is basically the same over time, so finding a feature of the Universe that has significantly changed over time strongly implies the Universe is not Steady and stable in its composition over time. 

**[00:18:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h18m26s)**  So by the time we discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, Steady State had already become the minority view of cosmologists, though still had a number of supporters. 

**[00:18:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h18m37s)**  Initially it wasn’t too bad a blow, as one plausible explanation could be that it was light from ancient stars that had been scattered around by galactic dust. 

**[00:18:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h18m46s)**  However as we mapped it out better it became increasingly clear that it was very evenly spread in all directions, so whatever was causing it had nothing to do with our galaxy. 

**[00:18:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h18m55s)**  When the Universe was a good deal younger and a good deal more dense, basically a big hot plasma, light was constantly being emitted by it but scattering right away. 

**[00:19:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h19m05s)**  Just one big white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. 

**[00:19:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h19m09s)**  As the Universe expanded and cooled, it eventually cooled enough to allow protons and electrons to bond to form neutral hydrogen gas instead, which no longer interacted with all that light as easily. 

**[00:19:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h19m21s)**  That light took off in every direction without constantly slamming into things and scattering. 

**[00:19:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h19m26s)**  For the first time, the universe became transparent. 

**[00:19:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h19m29s)**  The light was emitted all across the universe, sailing off in all directions and is now, 13.8 billion years later, arriving at every spot of space, since you can always draw a sphere around any given object, like Earth, that is just wide enough for light from that moment to be arriving,. 

**[00:19:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h19m47s)**  We call this the Surface of Last Scattering and expect it to keep getting bigger and weaker till the end of time. 

**[00:19:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h19m54s)**  Nowadays it’s microwaves, hence cosmic microwave background radiation or CMB. 

**[00:19:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h19m58s)**  In the past it was stronger infrared waves, long down the road it will be weaker radio waves. 

**[00:20:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h20m06s)**  That was predictable by the Big Bang Theory but not by Steady State or Static Models, so it didn’t quite kill them but it locked the Big Bang in as the overwhelming consensus model. 

**[00:20:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h20m17s)**  It still isn’t the only one, and it predicts multiple possible ends for the Universe from Big Rip to Big Crunch, but it’s essentially the state of play for the last several decades till now and still running strong. 

**[00:20:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h20m28s)**  We’ll be exploring those scenarios and some more evidence for the big bang in part two, and some more modern competing theories but as I said, Steady state didn’t die entirely, and indeed we got something called the Quasi-Steady-State model or QSS in the early 90s, which adjusted steady state to include mini-bangs, for instance, instead of matter appearing in bits and pieces constantly, it pops up in Big Bang events scattered far apart in time, but more like raindrops falling on a pond. 

**[00:20:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h20m56s)**  Issues with this include why we can’t see stuff older than the big bang, or local mini-bang, but indeed we often have had objects or structures that at least initially appeared older than the Universe. 

**[00:21:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h21m07s)**  This was particularly popular in what is called Plasma Cosmology, a theory of modest popularity in the 80s and 90s that was a variation on Steady State in the sense of the Universe having always been and always being, with no end. 

**[00:21:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h21m20s)**  Like many such models it didn’t handle thinks like quasars or cosmic microwave background radiation very well, but as we reached more modern times we also had to deal with both dark matter and dark energy, and we’ll look at the impact of those as we move in to part two, just follow the link to part two over on Paul Sutter’s channel. 

**[00:21:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h21m38s)**  We’ll be back again next week to discuss de-extinction of species and high-tech ecosystem preservation, for alerts when that and other episodes come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel, and don’t forget to subscribe to Paul’s Channel while you’re over their for part two and hit the like button for both episodes. 

**[00:21:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rpA-Bd0d6kw&t=00h21m54s)**  We’ll see you next week!
