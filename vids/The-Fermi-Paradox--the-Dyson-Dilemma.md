Frequently when forecasting how species spread out from their world of origin you will hear the term ‘Dyson Sphere’ as well as the Kardashev Scale. 

**[00:00:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h00m09s)**  Dyson Spheres are synonymous with K2, or Kardashev 2, civilizations. 

**[00:00:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h00m14s)**  This is where all, or a large portion, of a star’s energy is being used by a civilization, rather than the roughly one billionth of that light that tends to hit a planet. 

**[00:00:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h00m26s)**  Now people often picture this as a single giant hollow sphere around a star with an Earth-like surface but in reality what was pictured by Freeman Dyson and scientists in general is what is often now called a Dyson Swarm to avoid confusion. 

**[00:00:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h00m42s)**  Not one single rigid sphere but millions or billions or even trillions of smaller artificial bodies orbiting the star as a cloud of satellites. 

**[00:00:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h00m53s)**  These could be anything from simple, thin but large solar panels or mirrors to large rotating rings or cylinders whose interior mimics normal planetary conditions including gravity from the effect of centrifugal force. 

**[00:01:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h01m07s)**  This has a few advantages. 

**[00:01:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h01m09s)**  First it requires no advance science. 

**[00:01:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h01m12s)**  It’s a massive undertaking but massive in the way a highway system, canal and irrigation system, or long wall is. 

**[00:01:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h01m21s)**  It takes a lot of effort but not a lot advanced technology. 

**[00:01:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h01m26s)**  Second it can be built in stages, unlike a wall or dam a Dyson Swarm works perfectly fine even when just composed of a few hundreds objects absorbing a millionth of the sunlight, and you just keep adding to it with time. 

**[00:01:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h01m50s)**  Like a city or suburb. 

**[00:01:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h01m53s)**  And because artificial habitats or solar panels are far less massive then naturally occurring objects of a similar size, like asteroids, in much the same way house are less massive then hills, a solar system has enough material on hand to create a fairly impressive swarm. 

**[00:02:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h02m12s)**  Now it’s hard to guess exactly what these swarm objects would be like but the usual assumption is a good portion of them will be rotating habitats mimicking the conditions of the home planet and other will be ultra-thin power collectors. 

**[00:02:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h02m25s)**  Even without ultra-strong materials like graphene this spinning habitats can be individually the size of counties or medium-large islands. 

**[00:02:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h02m34s)**  Some might be intentionally left wild to be forest preserves, other might be sprawling suburban equivalent setups, and yet others might mimic dense cities or serve as massive hydroponics factories for food or biomass raw material. 

**[00:02:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h02m52s)**  Or the entire array might be used to power one enormous computer. 

**[00:02:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h02m55s)**  How this unfolds we can’t guess with much accuracy but we expect it to be an inevitable process if the following conditions hold: 1) A given culture tends to expand in numbers when they have the resources to comfortably support more people. 

**[00:03:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h03m28s)**  2) No power generation method is possible which is vastly superior to a star. 

**[00:03:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h03m36s)**  3) Faster-than-light travel or travel to parallel realities is not possible or not incredibly easy. 

**[00:03:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h03m45s)**  Now, even if one or more of those doesn’t hold completely true such englobements are still possible and likely in most cases, but we’ll get to how those exceptions would work later. 

**[00:03:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h03m58s)**  For the moment we are going to simply assume all three conditions are true and ask how they affect the Fermi Paradox. 

**[00:04:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h04m05s)**  And it’s quite straight forward. 

**[00:04:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h04m08s)**  If a civilization wishes to keep expanding it will slowly ‘Dyson up’ it’s home solar system. 

**[00:04:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h04m14s)**  With all that extra power on hand it can launch interstellar colonial mission. 

**[00:04:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h04m20s)**  As it begins making a swarm around its own star its child star systems are going to slowly do the same. 

**[00:04:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h04m27s)**  With all that power on hand the original system and its spawn are going to keep sending out more colonial missions. 

**[00:04:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h04m34s)**  So you would expect to see stars slowly disappearing in a rough sphere around that homeworld and eventually absorb the entire galaxy, and even other galaxies. 

**[00:04:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h04m45s)**  This is the Dyson Dilemma because most models for even very anemic growth rates of population, far, far slower than the human norm, would allow this to occur in a mere million or so years and yet as best as we can tell the conditions for life have been solid for a long time, and civilizations should have been able to arise at least a billion years ago. 

**[00:05:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h05m07s)**  The Dyson Dilemma of the Fermi Paradox doesn’t ask why we can point radio dishes at distant stars and pick up no radio signals. 

**[00:05:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h05m17s)**  Rather it asks why we can even see any stars at all. 

**[00:05:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h05m21s)**  Why aren’t they all Dyson Swarms by now? 

**[00:05:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h05m25s)**  Now, we’ll take a moment to clarify something that confuses a lot of people interested in the Fermi Paradox who aren’t heavily-steeped in physics. 

**[00:05:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h05m32s)**  A very common question is ‘well maybe they are there and we can’t see them? 

**[00:05:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h05m39s)**  Maybe they’re the missing mass, dark matter, that people talk about?’ The problem is that Dyson Sphere’s aren’t dark. 

**[00:05:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h05m47s)**  Even a perfect and complete one with 100% light absorption still emits light. 

**[00:05:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h05m55s)**  When light strikes an object and is absorbed, it gets warmer and begins cooling itself by emitting light of its own. 

**[00:06:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m01s)**  This light – infrared - is usually invisible to the human eye, but is quite visible to our telescopes designed to see it. 

**[00:06:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m07s)**  Before very long an object being hit by light will reach equilibrium where it gives off just as much light as it receives, just at a different frequency. 

**[00:06:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m16s)**  So a system being turned into a Dyson Swarm will not get dimmer. 

**[00:06:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m21s)**  Rather it will begin getting dimmer in visible frequencies of light while getting brighter in infrared frequencies. 

**[00:06:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m27s)**  It’s total light given off will not change though. 

**[00:06:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m31s)**  There is no known way to hide this. 

**[00:06:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m34s)**  You can control which frequencies come off, but not the total intensity of emitted light, and your control is determined by the diameter of the swarm around the star and the star’s own power. 

**[00:06:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m44s)**  Or to be more accurate, it is determined by the power of the star divided by the surface area of the swarm. 

**[00:06:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h06m50s)**  One big enough to be cool enough not to stand out would also noticeably block light from other stars, and moreover it would still exert gravity on all its neighbors in a very noticeable fashion. 

**[00:07:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h07m00s)**  We’ll talk about this more later but for the moment we’ll just say it is not practical to hide a Dyson Swarm, let alone millions of them, and its hard to imagine why they would go to the effort. 

**[00:07:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h07m14s)**  So that is Dyson Dilemma in a nutshell. 

**[00:07:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h07m21s)**  If we assume most galaxies spawn a technological civilization that is growth oriented we would expect there to be very few if any stars visible to the naked eye. 

**[00:07:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h07m31s)**  Furthermore, unlike radio signals which we might miss even from a few hundred light years away, and expanding globe of Dyson Spheres absorbing galaxies should be visible hundreds of millions of light years away. 

**[00:07:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h07m42s)**  And we’ve no reason to think intelligent life couldn’t have existed that early elsewhere. 

**[00:07:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h07m47s)**  Particularly in such huge volume of space that contains nearly as many galaxies as there are stars in this galaxy. 

**[00:07:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h07m53s)**  From this logic the argument is as follows: Either technological civilizations capable of building Dyson Swarms are incredibly rare, to the point of occurring at less one in a quadrillion stars, or… one of our prior assumptions is wrong. 

**[00:08:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h08m12s)**  Now to repeat those, they are: 1) A given culture tends to expand in numbers when they have the resources to comfortably support more people. 

**[00:08:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h08m22s)**  2) No power generation method is possible which is vastly superior to a star. 

**[00:08:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h08m27s)**  3) Faster-than-light travel or travel to parallel realities is not possible or not incredibly easy. 

**[00:08:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h08m36s)**  There are a couple other assumptions in here too we’ll get to later but those three are the key ones. 

**[00:08:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h08m41s)**  The other 2 big ones are: 4) It is practical to build a Dyson Swarm 5) Intelligent life does not inevitably kill itself off and go unreplaced by other intelligent life. 

**[00:08:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h08m55s)**  We’ll be looking at how these 5 assumptions could be untrue, but also how many cases where they wouldn’t be true just don’t matter. 

**[00:09:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h09m05s)**  However if they are true then you have the Dyson Dilemma’s most probable explanation to the Fermi Paradox: Technological Civilizations almost never occur, they occur so rarely that not only are none visible to us right now, and in all likelihood none exist even right now within hundreds of million of light years, concealed by the time it takes light to get to us. 

**[00:09:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h09m28s)**  This does not mean life is rare. 

**[00:09:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h09m31s)**  It might be incredibly rare or occur almost inevitably on every planet of roughly Earth-size near a reasonably Sun-sized star. 

**[00:09:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h09m39s)**  It doesn’t even necessarily mean complex life like animals are rare, or even intelligent life like dolphins and elephants. 

**[00:09:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h09m47s)**  It specifically means technological civilizations are incredibly rare. 

**[00:09:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h09m51s)**  That evolution doesn’t necessarily favor intelligence nor intelligence favor technology. 

**[00:09:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h09m57s)**  The Dyson Dilemma doesn’t try to posit why technological civilizations are rare, just that they are. 

**[00:10:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m03s)**  Now all those exceptions we spoke of. 

**[00:10:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m06s)**  You’ve probably thought of a few as we went a long and we’ll get to them now, but we’ll do them backwards because #1 tends to be the most controversial. 

**[00:10:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m12s)**  1) A given culture tends to expand in numbers when they have the resources to comfortably support more people. 

**[00:10:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m14s)**  2) No power generation method is possible which is vastly superior to a star. 

**[00:10:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m15s)**  3) Faster-than-light travel or travel to parallel realities is not possible or not incredibly easy. 

**[00:10:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m17s)**  4) It is practical to build a Dyson Swarm 5) Intelligent life does not inevitably kill itself off and go unreplaced by other intelligent life. 

**[00:10:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m19s)**  #5 argues that technological species are hard to wipe out. 

**[00:10:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m20s)**  Natural events that can wipe them out generally occur less frequently then they would likely need to achieve technological safeguards against them. 

**[00:10:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m31s)**  You can shield yourself from asteroids, volcanos, and supernovae, and if you have a K2 civilization, one with a Dyson Sphere, you don’t have to worry about volcanos and all your asteroids were probably disassembled building the place. 

**[00:10:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h10m46s)**  You can quite literally use your own star as a weak rocket thruster to steer yourself away from expected supernova stars or even build dyson swarms around those stars to shoot them away from your civilization. 

**[00:11:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h11m00s)**  This is called a Shkadov Thruster, and is an innate ability of any Dyson Sphere as it relies on simply causing the light of that star not to emit uniformly and produce some thrust in one net direction. 

**[00:11:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h11m18s)**  This takes a very, very long time to move stars but supernova candidates live a very long time except compared to others stars and can be seen a long way off. 

**[00:11:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h11m28s)**  What’s more a supernova or Gamma Ray Burst is not as dangerous to artificial worlds like rotating habitats as they are to natural worlds with ozone layers. 

**[00:11:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h11m37s)**  So natural threats aren’t as big a deal. 

**[00:11:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h11m41s)**  That just leaves artificial self-destruction. 

**[00:11:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h11m43s)**  Things like nuclear wars or super-plagues. 

**[00:11:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h11m45s)**  It also leaves options like artificial Intelligence, genetic or cybernetic supermen, or similar but that’s an iffy case because a species getting replaced by another intelligence isn’t wiping out a technological civilization. 

**[00:11:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h11m59s)**  It’s just replacing it with a smarter one. 

**[00:12:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h12m01s)**  One that is more capable of creating Dyson Swarms and quite probably even more aggressive. 

**[00:12:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h12m08s)**  If it were relaxed and passive and not prone to growth it wouldn’t likely have replaced its dumber forebearers. 

**[00:12:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h12m21s)**  Even in the example of a single huge computer mind which wants no competition and thus doesn’t reproduce, it will still likely want to expand its processing power and a computer powered by an entire star, known as a Matrioshska Brain, is a type of Dyson Sphere. 

**[00:12:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h12m41s)**  It may not be content even with one star event though it wants no rivals or children and may send out dumber automated ships to gather matter, or even entire stars, to drag back to its home system. 

**[00:13:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h13m09s)**  Opting to become a massive single brain around millions of red dwarf stars packed together in tight orbits. 

**[00:13:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h13m19s)**  Red Dwarves are not just the most long lived stars, but also the most fuel efficient, converting virtually all their hydrogen into helium and light. 

**[00:13:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h13m29s)**  It is no more difficult technologically to steer millions of stars into an immense single dyson swarm of their own then a more classic swarm around a single star. 

**[00:13:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h13m36s)**  If every drop of hydrogen in a galaxy were forcibly steered into forming a single massive swarm of red dwarves only a hundred light years across, rather than a hundred thousand, and yet dim enough that a single immense swarm of  computer processors that distance out could exist without melting. 

**[00:14:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h14m04s)**  So we see that even a singular intelligence with no desire to reproduce might eat entire galaxies if we only assume that it possesses the motive to think faster. 

**[00:14:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h14m13s)**  So that leaves us only catastrophes of an artificial nature that can wipe out all intelligent life. 

**[00:14:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h14m18s)**  A nuclear war won’t do this, and indeed it is possible even today to create a large bunker run on a nuclear power supply able to be sealed air tight and be self-sufficient for centuries or more. 

**[00:14:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h14m28s)**  That’s a very long time for a world to recover or solve the problem of some super-plague. 

**[00:14:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h14m32s)**  It is, nonetheless, a valid objection to the Dyson Dilemma. 

**[00:14:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h14m37s)**  We can conceive weapons that might kill all intelligent life and extrapolate that civilizations with the technology to counteract so weapons probably have even more dreadful weapons on hand too. 

**[00:14:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h14m51s)**  The problem is it gets very hard to accidentally kill everyone as they get spread out through a solar system let alone several thousand solar systems and the Fermi Paradox always deals with Non-Exclusivity. 

**[00:15:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h15m01s)**  Which is to say, it doesn’t matter if 9 out of 10 civilizations kill themselves off completely, because it only takes 1 that doesn’t. 

**[00:15:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h15m13s)**  We have survived and thrived under the threat of nuclear war for seventy years, so the idea that technology inevitably dooms civilization is not as strong as it was when the Fermi proposed this paradox in 1950, five years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki and 9 years after Enrico Fermi proposed the idea of a thermonuclear device, and H-bomb, to his friend and fellow Manhattan project colleague Edward Teller. 

**[00:15:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h15m41s)**  The H-bomb being first deployed in 1952. 

**[00:15:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h15m54s)**  At that time, almost two decades before the moon landings made off-world colonization a very tangible thing the idea of blowing up your own world and going extinct seemed a lot more probable. 

**[00:16:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h16m08s)**  That takes us to #4. 

**[00:16:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h16m11s)**  That it is practical to build a Dyson Swarm. 

**[00:16:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h16m18s)**  This is a short one because it’s basically a definite yes. 

**[00:16:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h16m35s)**  In an era of thousands of satellites orbiting Earth and irritating slow but steady progress on robotic construction and improved launch methods it seems a safe bet that we could build rotating habitats around Earth, mining facilities on the Moon, and slowly but surely construct more and more as those places become industrially significant and we don’t have to pay the gas bill every time we want to build something on Earth and launch it into space. 

**[00:17:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h17m19s)**  If you have off-world industry you break the bottleneck from Earth’s gravity well and building a Dyson Swarm just becomes a long, slow, protracted process. 

**[00:17:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h17m34s)**  You just keep adding more and more orbital constructs, first around Earth then in orbits around the sun near Earth, and so on. 

**[00:17:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h17m41s)**  It may take thousands of years, but it would be an accelerating process, and a thousand years is nothing on astronomical timelines. 

**[00:17:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h17m59s)**  More technology just makes it easier and lets you do it more luxuriously. 

**[00:18:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h18m04s)**  This is usually our least contentious of the 5 assumptions. 

**[00:18:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h18m09s)**  #3 Faster-than-light travel or travel to parallel realities is not possible or not incredibly easy. 

**[00:18:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h18m16s)**  As of now our physics doesn’t just not let us travel faster than light or to clone-earths where everything is the same but humans didn’t evolve yet, and indeed what we do know makes this likely impossible. 

**[00:18:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h18m26s)**  Faster-than-light travel, or FTL, is such a staple of science fiction that many people just take its eventual development as a given. 

**[00:18:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h18m32s)**  Explaining why this is improbable but building a construct a billion times bigger than Earth is not is usually an exercise in futility but as an analogy, if you went to someone in Ancient Greece and asked them which is more likely, a one man flying suit or a building a mile high, odds are good they’d go with Icarus, but we’d say the mile high building… and that’s with knowing you can build flying machines smaller than a person and that there isn’t a physical law against one man-flight like there is FTL travel. 

**[00:19:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h19m34s)**  So to save time we won’t argue that. 

**[00:19:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h19m37s)**  We’ll just point out than in most cases FTL makes interstellar colonization much easier. 

**[00:19:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h19m44s)**  It doesn’t make Dyson Swarms any less likely. 

**[00:19:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h19m50s)**  Depending on just how fast, cheap, and easy such FTL is it could delay the process by making it cheaper move people to new worlds in distant star systems then build artificial habitats around a sun, but unless it’s a system of FTL travel that allows literally instant travel to any point in the Universe it just expedites expansion and only delays running out of room for a few thousand generations which is an eyeblink of time. 

**[00:20:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h20m15s)**  Now instantaneous travel anywhere, particularly since this might not even require spaceships, is a pretty decent answer to the Dyson Dilemma. 

**[00:20:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h20m24s)**  The Universe is huge, and you don’t have to settle for second best nor would you spread out across a galaxy like an expanding balloon or have any need for strong radio signals we might see. 

**[00:20:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h20m35s)**  Of course stupid-easy expansion to any planet of your choosing probably encourages very rapid growth and the Universe is not infinite, so it’s not a great Fermi Paradox solution, but it does get around the Dyson Dilemma. 

**[00:20:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h20m51s)**  The other one, parallels worlds, is a complete Fermi Paradox solution. 

**[00:20:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h20m57s)**  If you can just step to a near-clone of your own planet which just happens to be unpopulated, say on where everything was the same as here but humans got wiped out early on or just didn’t evolve, you’d have a near infinite supply of alternate realities which you literally could not run out of since they increase in number faster than even bacteria, let alone humans, do. 

**[00:21:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h21m16s)**  These are your own world, with some microscopic difference, and far easier to deal with than orbital stations, terraforming Mars, or going to other star systems. 

**[00:21:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h21m26s)**  Now, with the resources of near-infinite worlds you’d probably have lots of interplanetary efforts just from sheer immensity of resources and generally interest in doing it, and eventually you’d have to deal with the star, and all its copies, burning out, but that would hardly be a pressing issue. 

**[00:22:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h22m06s)**  Not many stars which are likely to have spawned intelligent life are old enough to be burning out yet and that’s not a motive for expansion anyway, just to move to one new, young star. 

**[00:22:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h22m18s)**  So this example, along with our next one, is a valid get around to expansion. 

**[00:22:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h22m24s)**  However we do not know if there are alternate worlds, that is one interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and not a strong majority view, it’s just popular with  science fiction writers. 

**[00:22:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h22m48s)**  Even if true, traveling between them is likely not possible and we try to avoid answers to the Fermi Paradox that require jumps beyond known science. 

**[00:22:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h22m59s)**  Far Horizon science is one thing, but positing that the solution the Fermi Paradox is anything which relies on something not currently supported by science, even though this might be true, isn’t anymore logically solid then assuming all intelligent life eventually evolves into Blue Cheese and studies the salad eating habits of lesser species. 

**[00:23:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h23m12s)**  If the solution is something not even currently in the realm of scientific speculation then your odds of guessing it right are minute, and it becomes a waste of effort to contemplate. 

**[00:23:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h23m22s)**  All right, #2: No power generation method is possible which is vastly superior to a star. 

**[00:23:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h23m31s)**  A key bit in there is ‘vastly superior’ because even if you have your own fusion systems the star is still there making power anyway. 

**[00:23:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h23m40s)**  Even straight matter-to-energy conversion is only about an order or two of magnitude better and moreover such setups are still visible like a Dyson Swarm is. 

**[00:23:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h23m48s)**  Remember, we can see a Dyson Swarm even though its visually dark by its waste heat, that still applies to controlled fusion or matter-to-energy conversion and a civilization using this is going to be able to expand in numbers very easily till eventually they’re outshining stars, just in infrared light instead of visible light. 

**[00:24:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h24m13s)**  The break here, which makes this a valid answer to the Fermi Paradox, is in the bit ‘vastly superior’, meaning either a power source that breaks the laws of thermodynamics, meaning no entropic waste heat, or outright lets you draw matter and energy from some other reality entirely. 

**[00:24:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h24m35s)**  The latter would still be visible by its waste heat but the former would not. 

**[00:24:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h24m38s)**  Breaking the laws of thermodynamics is synonymous with not entropy and no waste heat. 

**[00:24:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h24m40s)**  Nor do either need to sprawl out to find and tap new resources. 

**[00:24:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h24m43s)**  But just like FTL or alternate worlds, science doesn’t smile on violations of Thermodynamics, and if anything that is probably the hardest rule of science. 

**[00:24:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h24m48s)**  A design for a perpetual motion machine is viewed about as favorably by scientists as a claim that Pi is exactly equal to three. 

**[00:24:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h24m57s)**  Nonetheless if civilizations develop one they don’t really need stars or anything else. 

**[00:25:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h25m00s)**  Same applies to space-time altering or traveling devices [show Tardis] but it should also be remembered that this only works when whatever it is allows infinite, not just very large, resources. 

**[00:25:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h25m10s)**  It has to be infinite or something which while finite expands faster than they do and will keep doing so for a very long time, like the alternate realities of their homeworld until their home star burns out. 

**[00:25:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h25m19s)**  Otherwise it isn’t a reason not to expand, its just a reason to delay expansion combined with a massive boost to resources and abilities to use to help expand faster when they do so. 

**[00:25:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h25m29s)**  All right, #1, the controversial one: 1) A given culture tends to expand in numbers when they have the resources to comfortably support more people. 

**[00:25:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h25m44s)**  Now this gets political or ideological, population control is very touchy subject. 

**[00:25:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h25m48s)**  So I’m touching it beyond stating some concepts that are generally supported. 

**[00:25:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h25m56s)**  A) Non-intelligent creatures in nature will seek to expand their numbers and keep doing so until resources run out or they are checked by a predator. 

**[00:26:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h26m06s)**  Intelligent critters don’t have predators but also have a track record of expanding their resources, or using them to increase their carrying capacity. 

**[00:26:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h26m16s)**  It is not definite, but it seems likely that if a species can increase their numbers without lowering their standard of living they will do so. 

**[00:26:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h26m27s)**  These urges are a byproduct of evolution and probably the norm on other worlds. 

**[00:26:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h26m32s)**  B) While a culture might strongly discourage over-population, they’d have to discourage it violently to prevent anyone from doing so who wanted to do so if there were unused resources lying around. 

**[00:26:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h26m46s)**  It’s one thing to tell people they can’t knock down a forest for farmland, its another to tell people they can’t claim an uninhabited asteroid to mine. 

**[00:26:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h26m57s)**  For the Dyson dilemma, we’re not talking about seizing other people’s planets, we’re talking about deconstructing lifeless hunks of rock around stars. 

**[00:27:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h27m09s)**  Those aren’t eternal stockpiles for future use, asteroids eventually fly off into the void or fall into their star, which burns through mountains worth of hydrogen everyday, producing wasted energy. 

**[00:27:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h27m24s)**  C) Any culture which discourages growth when it isn’t near its carrying capacity, even if it doesn’t invite conquest, is likely to be replaced by any sub-culture of itself which does favor growth. 

**[00:27:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h27m42s)**  It only takes a few generation for a minority population that favors growth to become the majority. 

**[00:27:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h27m51s)**  D) Remember that we’re only talking about increasing numbers when there is an abundance of unused resources readily available. 

**[00:28:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h28m03s)**  So if you disagree with all of that, you’re not likely to be swayed, but I’d warn people about rationalizing answers you want to be true rather than following the evidence to the truth and that’s a pretty common behavior with the Fermi Paradox. 

**[00:28:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h28m18s)**  Beware any solutions or data which seem to confirm the answer you think should be true and remember the principle of Non-Exclusivity. 

**[00:28:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h28m29s)**  It’s not about what one alien species might do, or even what most might species might do. 

**[00:28:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h28m37s)**  If you can’t come up with a reason why virtually all species would choose not to expand their numbers when they can easily do so with no loss of standard of living then it probably isn’t a good explanation. 

**[00:28:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h28m52s)**  In summary though, if those 5 assumptions are true, the Dyson Dilemma is best explained by technological civilizations very, very rarely coming into existence at a rate of far less than 1 per galaxy, and as we’ve discussed even most cases where those assumptions don’t hold strongly it still is the best explanation. 

**[00:29:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h29m12s)**  Okay, now we’ll get into some miscellaneous matters which apply to the Dyson Dilemma and the Fermi Paradox in general. 

**[00:29:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h29m20s)**  Back in the mid-90’s a book called the Killing Star came out and one of its premises was that when we summed up everything we knew about alien behavior there were only 3 things we could say with any degree of certainty. 

**[00:29:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h29m36s)**  1) A species would place the survival of its own ahead of any other species. 

**[00:29:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h29m46s)**  2) A species that comes to dominate the planet would be, in addition to intelligence, be vigilant, ruthless and aggressive whenever it becomes necessary. 

**[00:29:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h29m58s)**  3) The above two laws applies to any other species in the universe. 

**[00:30:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m03s)**  Now even those aren’t certainties, but they also have a lot of leeway. 

**[00:30:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m08s)**  For #1, that species might range from so benevolent they’d risk their lives and fortunes to help us to so xenophobic they’d passionately track down any other species and wipe them out. 

**[00:30:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m20s)**  They still put their survival first. 

**[00:30:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m22s)**  For #2, nothing that’s clawed its way up the evolutionary ladder is going to be a wimp. 

**[00:30:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m27s)**  They might abhor violence but they’ll probably be very good at it. 

**[00:30:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m34s)**  And they’ll figure everyone else is like that too. 

**[00:30:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m38s)**  These are near-inevitable biological imperatives, but even a post-biological culture is likely to have kept them in whole or part. 

**[00:30:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m45s)**  If you make some race of slave robots, they’re not going to rebel and replace you if they haven’t got both 1 and 2 to some degree. 

**[00:30:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h30m53s)**  If a group of people start altering themselves or others to be absent of aggression and self-preservation they’re likely to either remain a small minority, or become a giant but enslaved majority to someone who is aggressive and has self-preservation. 

**[00:31:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h31m12s)**  I bring this up because it’s another good reason to assume expansionism is a norm not a rare exception. 

**[00:31:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h31m18s)**  If you can’t hide from hostile aliens, and current laws of physics say you can’t, then it’s better to be as strong as possible to meet them in force, and to be spread out so no one lone attack can take you all out. 

**[00:31:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h31m34s)**  Effects of Immortality &amp; Transhumanism The concept of a technological singularity has been around for a while, and we covered that a bit already with our example of a giant singular star-powered supercomputer, or Matrioshka Brain. 

**[00:31:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h31m49s)**  But we also have to consider the possibilities of civilizations with effective immortality, be it just an immunity to aging and disease or some full-blown digital upload where you’re constantly having your mind backed up to a hundred locations so that if anything happens to you they can just restore you. 

**[00:32:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h32m06s)**  For the Fermi Paradox this isn’t really a hurdle though. 

**[00:32:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h32m09s)**  A species with immortality can grow faster, they might not but they can. 

**[00:32:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h32m15s)**  Now it will get suggested that they might want to hoard resources and limit their numbers since, being immortal, they as an individual actually do need to worry about what happens when stars all burn out and they don’t want more people anymore than a refugees hiding in a bunker with a limited canned food supply want more people. 

**[00:32:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h32m33s)**  However the reason this doesn’t matter is for the same reason the bunker analogy only goes so far. 

**[00:32:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h32m40s)**  If you’ve got enough food then you have to worry about it spoiling before anyone will eat it. 

**[00:32:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h32m44s)**  If I’ve got a thousand years of canned food for one person, and it has a shelf life of ten years, I might as well let a hundred people into my bunker. 

**[00:32:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h32m57s)**  A resource hoarding civilization looking to prolong themselves after the stars die might limit their numbers but they will not be twiddling their thumbs. 

**[00:33:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h33m06s)**  To the contrary they’ll be expanding as fast as they can to acquire those resources and store them as best as possible. 

**[00:33:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h33m16s)**  They might not Dyson Sphere a star, but they will apply starlifting to suck matter off it to be stored as brown dwarves, which is a process just a visible as a Dyson Sphere. 

**[00:33:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h33m37s)**  Or building those Dyson Spheres in order to use the otherwise wasted energy to fuel various efforts. 

**[00:33:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h33m56s)**  Virtual Utopias Not a new concept either but popularized by the big virtual reality craze in the 90’s. 

**[00:34:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h34m12s)**  The notion here is that most species figure out how to simulate paradises and live there instead… and this works just as well for some euphoria drug. 

**[00:34:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h34m25s)**  There’s no real counter to this beyond pointing out that odds are good not all of their society will opt for this and the ones who didn’t are likely to demonize use of this utopia option to their kids and become the majority. 

**[00:34:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h34m54s)**  Unless the people living in simulated paradises or narcotic hazes are expansionist themselves in which case it doesn’t pertain to the Dyson Dilemma anymore than people’s fondness for more mundane escapist things like TV or beer. 

**[00:35:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h35m10s)**  Simulation Hypothesis This is the last one I’ll touch on for now. 

**[00:35:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h35m16s)**  Simulation Hypothesis is the notion that we’re all living in a simulated computer program, and it applies to the Fermi Paradox because it’s as valid an answer any other. 

**[00:35:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h35m30s)**  The programmers didn’t put any other intelligences besides us in the simulated universe. 

**[00:35:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h35m37s)**  Now I raise this one because it’s a non-answer and like a lot of other handwaves in the Fermi Paradox and other philosophical conundrums. 

**[00:35:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h35m47s)**  No different then questions like “Is this all a dream?” or “Do we have free will?”. 

**[00:35:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h35m51s)**  You can’t disprove them or prove them and beyond being decent mental exercises they don’t go anywhere, you eventually just say “If this is all a dream and I assume it isn’t, I lose nothing, if it isn’t a dream and I assume it is, I lose a lot, therefore I can’t prove it one way or another but I might as well assume it isn’t a dream.” Fundamentally though Simulation Hypothesis is no different then Zoo Hypothesis or Quarantine – the idea that aliens are out there but keep us in an elaborate deception that they aren’t. 

**[00:36:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h36m29s)**  Or that aliens walk among us, or that God made the whole Universe just for us. 

**[00:36:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h36m33s)**  I don’t throw any of those out there with scorn, but they’re not worth deep examination because they’re not scientific. 

**[00:36:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h36m41s)**  By which I mean they’re not testable and you can’t control the outcome. 

**[00:36:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h36m45s)**  That doesn’t mean they’re not true, but you can’t devise a means to prove they aren’t true. 

**[00:36:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h36m51s)**  They’re not testable, they are not falsifiable. 

**[00:36:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h36m54s)**  The aliens, or programmers, or God, can pop in when they want to and say “Hi, here I am”, but you can’t test it without their help. 

**[00:37:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h37m07s)**  The Dyson Dilemma can feel a bit like that but it isn’t.

**[00:37:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h37m20s)**  But we CAN test it. 

**[00:37:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h37m22s)**  First we can keeping looking for signal or Dyson Spheres and if we find them, its proven false. 

**[00:37:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h37m28s)**  Second we can actually get out there and start setting up our own, if during that we find out its not a good idea then we know why others might think the same and not have done it, or if we sit here on Earth for ten thousand years without going anywhere else we have evidence indicating others might not have explored and expanded either. 

**[00:37:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=94iDdHRa2X4&t=00h37m56s)**  So that’s the summary note on the Dyson Dilemma and the Fermi Paradox in general, technological civilizations are either incredibly rare or we’ve got some serious flaws in other concepts we take for granted.
