Welcome. This video we'll be covering various types of megastructures and artificial worlds and constructs which you'll be familiar with from science or science fiction. We'll be covering everything from NEO low horizon orbital types which might have a dozen or so people inside it. Up to things the size of planets or even the size of solar systems like a Dyson Sphere. For that reason we have an ad-hoc classification system which will be using that roughly NEO stellar classifications. We'll go over that in just a moment. First though let me add a quick thank you and plug for Steve Bowers who provided the majority of the images will be using here and the Orion's Arm project. Orion's Arm is a shared sci-fi setting that is also a wonderful resource for looking into a lot of the other megastructures in detail and many of the sci-fi subjects which are covered in the encyclopedia Galactica. 

**[00:00:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h00m56s)**  They also have one of the most comprehensive collections of links for writers and sci-fi fans in terms of tools and maps that you can use for your own interests. 

**[00:01:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h01m06s)**  So that's a site definitely worth checking out - orionsarm.com. 

**[00:01:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h01m10s)**  So let's go ahead and move into our classification system. First type is types. 

**[00:01:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h01m16s)**  We have artificial gravity, situations where it's not applicable, rotational gravity, spherical or classical gravity and zero or microgravity. 

**[00:01:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h01m25s)**  Where artificial gravity is concerned this is the situation you're most familiar with from science fiction films that there is simply no way to produce films in zero gravity or microgravity so in TV and film they typically just have artificial gravity of some sort. 

**[00:01:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h01m40s)**  We won't be using too many examples of that but it is worth noting as a class that we'll see a few of. 

**[00:01:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h01m46s)**  We also have a lot of situations where it simply won't apply. 

**[00:01:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h01m48s)**  Like the Lofstrom Launch Loop. The gravity that's there is really not related to the object or there's simply no reason why we care about the gravity there, like a giant space gun or railgun. It has nothing to do with the purpose of the object. 

**[00:02:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h02m02s)**  The one we'll spend the most time on is rotational gravity. 

**[00:02:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h02m05s)**  This is a spin gravity case where the experience of gravity is felt by the fact that you're being pinned to the floor by centrifugal forces. 

**[00:02:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h02m14s)**  We have an awful lot of examples of that we'll be going over one at a time but it probably makes up the bulk of all cases. We are also going to try to avoid getting too math heavy but there is an equation that's relevant for rotating habitats that matters. The acceleration which for earth gravity be 9.8 meters per second squared that you would want to have to simulate gravity requires that you spin the station at a given velocity based on its radius and that's the velocity squared divided by the radius. Our next type is spherical or classic gravity this won't always be just a planet or an asteroid but it is the most well-known example this is straight real gravity that you're experiencing. 

**[00:02:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h02m59s)**  So this does not necessarily have to be caused by a classic planet. There are a number of situations you can create where you would have gravity from mass but the planet is not the same size as Earth or might not have a terrestrial natural origin. 

**[00:03:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h03m16s)**  These come in as nearly as many shapes and sizes as the ring spinning habitats do and we'll be looking at quite a few of these. 

**[00:03:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h03m24s)**  Then our last category which is simply zero gravity or microgravity. These are circumstances where the habitat, the space station or the artificial world just does not have any significant amount of gravity felt by the people inside. 

**[00:03:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h03m36s)**  Besides the space station you could have habitats full of a large inflated balls full of air. 

**[00:03:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h03m41s)**  Our next category that we'll be looking at ... classification system is size. 

**[00:03:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h03m46s)**  These things again can range from the size of the space station all the way up to things as big as the solar system. So we have a set order of magnitude scale to look at this. 

**[00:03:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h03m58s)**  We'll give a number N where N is ten to the nth power in terms of its width in meters. 

**[00:04:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=M8ryqjyLBL8&t=00h04m05s)**  So N equals 1 would be 10 meters N equals 2 would be 100 meters N equals 3 will be 1000 meters N equals 6 would be a million meters and so on. So type and size will be combined as follows: Z1 would be a zero gravity environment about 10 meters across like the space station a large rotating habitats several miles long would be a R4 something the size of the earth and almost all of the planets you normally associated as being a planet that you could live on would be a S7 indicating a spehrical gravity and is about ten thousand kilometers or 10 million meters across and then an A11 would be something with artificial gravity about the size of Earth's orbit around the Sun like a Dyson Sphere our last category is habitability now for all purposes we're just going to say that one hectare which is a 100-meter x 100-meter area about the size of a acre is about how much space you need for one person to grow all their food and have some forested garden area it's a very approximate figure but Earth has about 14 billion hectares of land including unusable stuff like deserts and polar regions and about 7 billion people or roughly ten to the tenth power this conveniently gives us the roman numeral X for 10 and we use that same ten to the nth system so X would be what it would be for earth and other planets and s7x would be your typical planet that was fully populated this shots our handy guide and we'll be using this classification only very approximately because a hunter-gatherer civilization for instance would be about too lower on the chart they don't need one hectare per person they need around a hundred alternatively with very intensive hydroponics or aeroponics and artificial lighting you can easily get a hundred people fed off of one hectare and you could have sci-fi settings for instance or futures of humanity where you don't even eat food you you run on electricity so it's an approximate scale and X conveniently is about the population of a planet we only be using this for when you'd expect that the place in question to be mostly self-sufficient as a kind of artificial planet even when they're not terribly huge themselves in a lot of situations the habitability index just doesn't apply for those where it does the classification will look a lot like this Z1i or Z1 one would be the space station it's got very few people on it the R4v or R4 five for example would be a situation about 100,000 people S7x again being earth would be an example of a place that could handle some billions of people and then the case for Dyson Sphere its tens of billions of billions of people who would live in that kind of circumstance with the same space that you would have on Earth so since the artificial and not applicable categories don't really have any kind of specific shape and come in so many different varieties we'll start with the rotating gravity ones as specific examples it's also important to understand that these things do not necessarily have to appeal from the outside as a cylinder when you're dealing with a ship or when you're dealing with a space station they are cylindrical in terms of parts that have gravity they can have a non-rotating shell outside them you can actually go ahead and embed them right into an asteroid for instance and the in thing that comes up sometimes with this is your hear people say let's hollow out an asteroid and spin it you would never actually do that the gravity that these things under gets higher the further you are from the axis of rotation most asteroids are loosely held together balls of gravel they have a very weak surface gravity and you actually spun the entire asteroid at speeds to produce artificial gravity for humans they were flying apart nor do you need to spend them you just need to make sure there was no few metres of room between the actual spinning object and some shell you've constructed inside the asteroid the other thing of note with these is that you can only build them as wide in terms of radius or diameter as something that can actually handle that force on earth would be able to handle it's like a suspension bridge that's as long as the circumference of the station many materials just cannot handle you know miles and miles long circumferences Now let's actually get into all specific examples this is Von Braun's space station from 1952 one the original designs and one that is pretty familiar looking it's not a very large object it's less than a hundred meters across and it's got room for less than a hundred people on it NASA did quite a few of these kind of mockups in late fifties and early sixties and this is a hexagonal rotating one, designed to be inflated from the early sixties it wasn't very long before people started envisioning much larger places places where people would actually live as opposed to tight confined spaces you'd find at a place of business a post in the Antarctic that sort of thing one of the first of these is the Standford Torus there's also the Bernal Sphere which is another one from that era and these are designed of the assumption that you're using steel to make them these are examples will generally known as O'Neill cylinders named for John O'Neill and work on an assumption that you're powering these things with the light of the local sun that they're some kilometers across or miles across and that they could be home to many thousands tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of people one example is a lot of people be familiar with from science fiction is the Babylon 5 space station and TV show these are work on the assumption you just cannot build a space station more than about 10 kilometers in diameter before it's going to start ripping itself apart from normal metals here's another example from the city of Enoch project you can check out their facebook page at this point we have to go into objects that are much bigger that can only be built out of things that could not be conceived of until the mid nineties when we discovered carbon nanotubes and graphene these are substance you put a lot about and what let us think about ideas like space elevators at this point in time you're no longer discussing things that a few thousand people can live on something the size of a city maybe a metropolis you're looking at things that are size of large countries there's a picture of Great Britain it is actually to scale there Great Britain is about a thousand kilometers from top to bottom this thing is about 500 kilometers wide it's about 2,000 kilometers in diameter so it is actually pretty close to the size of the eastern united states in terms of total land area but the bishop ring is just saw the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with graphene and nanotubes the McKendree cylinder is the next biggest one and it's actually several thousand kilometers long and as wide as the Bishop Ring here you have an object that's capable of housing potentially nearly a planetary population that have the i the ix the 9 population for habitability you could fit a billion people on this thing quite comfortably it's typically again several thousand kilometers long the thing is enormous and you can put multiple levels in there as well we typically picture these just having that one level open sky but they could be many many levels high and in this picture for instance that is not a close-up of the McKendree cylinder relative to a planet that's actually about the scale of a McKendree cylinder again its many thousands of kilometers long it does not necessarily need to have those light absorption discs by the way that's just the assumption that you don't have some power source that could let you simulate sunlight now no matter what you do there are certain limitations on how big you can make these things using classic materials as we said but you can still keep scaling up as one solid object an example of that is a Rungworld where each of those little rungs on that apparent ladder going around a circle could be something size of an O'Neill cylinder or a McKendree cylinder so that thing could be the size of several planets or can wrap around an entire star One orbital habitat that's of special note is the Banks orbital named for Ian M Banks the late and great author of the cultural series this is an orbital that specifically the necessary radius to produce Earth like gravity and have a day length brought by its own natural sun that it's in orbit around that is exactly the same as a day on there and for Earth that's several million kilometers across these things are typically the size of a couple hundred Earths when they are set up that way you can make them a lot thicker though but that's always going to be unique size for a given day length and a given gravity there's only going to be one exact size that can make that configuration next we have a very popular one the Ringworld first again popularized by Larry Niven in the book titled that this is an orbital habitat that is placed around a star typically at the distance from it that Earth is and it's going to be about the size of a couple of million Earths less well-known but from the same author is a Topopolis or a spaghetti world this is a thin rotating habitat that's simply very very long you can wrap it around a star several times and so long as it's much longer than it is wide it has no problem spinning even when you call it around just like a rope so you can spin around a star and these can be pretty much any length you want something like the Rungworld or the Topopolis example is a Polyhedral habitat which is sometimes called Bucky habitat these can be very very large wrapped around entire stars but they are essentially a long connection of cylinder habitats whether they're McKendree sized objects or the O'Neill cylinder type objects and again mckendree objects are usually thousand kilometers long whereas only $PERCENT or so on doors are usually in the tens of kilometers law a movie on to the next class vehicle gravity I want to talk about hybrid example a lot of times when you're walking with a moon base or emulsion base from someplace with a gravity exists and is significant but isn't what you want you to be stuck with that in fiction or examples but you don't actually have to be you can combine the rotational gravity and spherical gravity or classic gravity much like a washing machine when you put water it will spin and former parabola you can arrange to have the sides of your habitat slope like that so that you spend the habitat it will combine the gravity that's caused by the local man and by spinning to produce a gravity equal to that of off and if you're on a vacuum environment like the moon there's no real reason why you wouldn't do that a bit of a hassle little energy intensive but not actually all that bad on next major category is feel gravity classic gravity now this is a much build category that you initially think we're not just talking about large moons classic planets and we're also including shell wards examples of this would be where you construct the board around large object like a black hole which could be smaller than a planet or larger because it's not official black hole around the gas giant or even just compressed gas this isn't strictly limited to super-powerful material was that allow you to make a rigid shell the size of multiple planets this requires though that you use something called active support the easiest way to think of active support would be a garden hose that was connected to a pump at both ends once you turn the pump on the holes were immediately spring into a sachal even do this with magnetically propelled small particles moving mass stream so that you can create widget objects in a circular form that are just huge and size we call this active support because no matter how efficient you make this system there's going to be some energy last so you're going to have to constantly be adding power and assistant hold your plan together all that a hoarder polish so it doesn't fall together and this can be done it's probably scientifically possible it's a little bit ahead of us right now because it's just huge and energy consumption of but is one alternative space elevators you could make one of these rings that was hoping just above the atmosphere of the planet and just connect shortalls a few miles I to it another example of natural gravity would be a shell ward in this case a matryoshka doll time situation where it's just layer after layer of contention of concentric spheres around each other you have to unofficially like those and you have knowledge pillows that helped hold up the sky and a very atlas like example here each Leo either has a slightly higher gravity to get for them out or if you space them out phone off you can keep it at the same stable gravity by just having a different distance treats layoffs you want to take a moment to avoid confusing this with a matryoshka brain which is another type of contract will discuss later on your heel this time a lot more often than the shell for example come back to that later on another example would be a hoop war-torn swore don't ward call what you would in this example you have something knows about 10 times the size of Earth so long as the hoops diameter is much wider than that of the actual thing itself you're going to have perfectly normal gravity on this office our next category of microgravity habitats these can come in almost any type of sale no such as the space station with Space Shuttle all the way up to self-contained wards general just full of fail this another artificial ward that was popularized by lady Nevin him as well as dr. Freeman Dyson and Paul borch were some of the guys who came up with almost all these ideas very impressive the smoking example he actually has a large are loosely held together atmosphere around and I'll stall in another bulge donut shape but there's also self-contained varieties such as the at us feel we are the here it's got advertising on the outside of it but inside here you have a low-gravity environment where you can breathe and where it's a warm temperature but you'd have to have artificial lighting and again it's zero gravity some of our balls are more popular examples like discords here's an example one that's a couple thousand kilometers across this where you live on a flat off one side or both sides then big enough they could have their own gravity but we usually think this is something with artificial gravity probably the best-known fictional example of this is the discord by terry pratchett great series a fantasy parody novels as well as the outer sandisk now normally in addison disc is not considered a really great one to use we were just like it's very large armed it's surrounds and tile stone but it's pretty much always in a constant perpetual haze of twilight and does not get a lot of light you can get around this and the way that you would usually do that would be to float meals over your stall that will set up two cars a day and night cycle this is where we get into another one of those concepts will be using a little later on koristad ID that's short for a static satellite this is something that much like a solar sail is pushed on by sunlight nor to move in this case though it's hung exactly at the distance where the solar pressure and the gravity equal out for that object so that does not fall into the Sun or get for the way with statics you can float meals over the Sun one big one or hundreds of their tiny ones we're going to move on the class are called Stella of engines and the classic example this is a Dyson Sphere again a Dyson Sphere is a couple billion times bigger than Earth in terms of Lance office although a real one would probably be a little bit further out from the Sun and authors because of that day night cycle where you might have some static meals around actually mimic that but it has two sides one dark one light if you only get daylight the entire time as far away as authors from the Sun you're going to melt pretty quickly you need to be a little bit for them out than that fundamentally at dyson sphere's just not really a stable object and of itself it can even drift into its own star and needs artificial gravity so we usually talk about a dyson swarm instead this is identical to a Dyson Sphere except it's composed of unless millions and billions even trillions of rotating habitats or standards the other aspect of dyson swarm is it doesn't have to be complete and you can build up in stages so you could have a dyson swarm that only would say one percent coverage or absorption light and build that out of local materials a lot easier than you can actually dyson sphere where you're probably not going to have enough your matter to make good thick shells and Dyson swarms are also a little bit unstable so we also will catch you talk about a Jenkins swarm which is a sort of a very large donation amount of style of various swarm objects rotating bodies or Chapel these don't follow circular orbits though they follow a slightly elliptical path that brings up a little bit closer on for the way from the Sun and you'd probably use that to simulate your seasons we mentioned the matryoshka pain earlier this is an object it's basically a Dyson Sphere Dyson swarm well instead of it being for people to live on you're using all their collective power to bunny single massive supercomputer weird Isis viewers almost incomprehensible huge in terms of how many people can support a matryoshka brain is almost in comprehensive huge are even more so in terms of how many calculations can form especially cuz it's assumed to be done by computer much more advanced in terms of micro sizing than our current ones are you'd expect an object like this too it was treated as a human mind be one that was trillions of trillions of trillions of times faster than a human next category of stellar engine are the ones designed to remove mass from last all-star lifting swarm or start lifting ring and this is basically how you go about killing a stall but isn't really weaponize about this requires a lot of infrastructure to do basically it relies around using the magnetic field that a star has and setting up a ring around it or swim around at bet is going in the opposite direction to basically rip matter off and comes to admit at the northern and southern ports of the planet and the magnetic field is very intense and by by setting up of being around that spins and superconducting magnet you can turn off gigatonnes of matter from that style of potentially reducing it down to nothing eventually big stars are much better and live a lot less time they also bought a much smaller percentage of hydrogen so it's reasonable to say that you might take a larger star than all yellow sun and strip matter away from it so that lives longer or even a Yellow Sun to strip it down to be an event war which live for many hundreds of billions or trillions of years and used up almost all the hydrogen so they could be seen as much longer more efficient engines now if you actually want to move a stall or solar system you have what's called the Chicago Russell this is basically a half meal amount of stall and you often have a lot closer to the stall then you would have died since field because you just need to make sure it's not so close it doesn't melt this would be a state ID or swimmers tonight's like pushed on the from one direction and it pushed back in the opposite direction the light from the star goes out in one general direction and this causes a force to be pushed on the meal and the style and the entire solar system slowly accelerating up to high speeds it takes millions of years to move any significant distance billions of years to move in our galactic scale but this does actually work just fine it should be noted that the rate at which accelerates is related to the luminosity and mass the stall the right is the fast moves to have it is the slower moves but stars actually raise their luminosity or how but they are much faster than their mass an order of about the cube or fourth power so a very bright stall such as one could go supernova is an ideal candidate to hit with a shikara first because you can move it very quickly not really a red wolf will take a very long time to accelerate up this way those are your stellar engines now that's not the absolute end of things there are many contracts have been thought through even bigger on the galactic scale the only one I'm going to take a moment to mention is a one of the examples pub or given way are you take a galactic size black hole we're talking about black heel of many millions of stops of solar masses like the kind you find the center of the galaxy and you build a shell around that like the super Monday know shell Wars be discussed and then you put another shell around that and another shell amount that's and another shell around that obviously these have to be actively supported you can put in so many layers that you're not just talking about a Dyson Sphere hear you talk about something that's almost as big to a Dyson Sphere as a Dyson Sphere Liz to the earth and you can actually live inside this thing you could have endless layers of shell Wars of office trillions of or swath of area to live on and what's interesting is that the lowest levels time is actually running slower from the distortion effect though there's no title for sustaining your part then is the highest level so at the lower levels time runs slowly at the higher levels that runs the normal time and this is the best of my knowledge the biggest biggest construction could ever make that would have human habitability by normal people I'm a little posture it not just because it's a so immensely huge compared to a Dyson Sphere but because it's by the center of the galaxy and seems like would be an amazingly cool capital for galactic empire so that's we're going to go ahead and finish off there's a lot of arm megastructures we did not even touch on i would certainly encourage you to research more of those but these are almost the general one that you'd expect to ever really see used multiple times I'm a different settings or in science in general anyway I hope you've enjoyed this and thanks for watching
