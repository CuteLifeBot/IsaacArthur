Ah, Genetic Engineering, the field of science that will one day let us ride around dinosaurs &nbsp;throwing pokemon at each other. 

**[00:00:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h00m10s)**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our topic today is bioforming and gene-tailoring, both basically extensions on genetic engineering, and initially I had thought we would keep it pretty practical and down to Earth, discuss things like CRISPR and the ways it can be used to fix health problems. 

**[00:00:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h00m29s)**  We would look at ethical issues and potential benefits and concerns about this technology. 

**[00:00:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h00m34s)**  And we will get to those, but then I found myself thinking, lots of folks have discussed that and discussed it well, and this channel does not generally focus on ‘Down to Earth’. 

**[00:00:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h00m44s)**  Heck last episode I was talking about moving galaxies. 

**[00:00:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h00m47s)**  So yes we will talk about the near-term applications and the ethical issues but we will push the envelope out a bit and explore some novel, even zany, applications of this sort of technology, though we will keep it the realm of what is allowed by known science or at least not forbidden by it. 

**[00:01:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h01m06s)**  Which includes making dinosaurs, as in Jurassic Park, because honestly I can't think of many things cooler than riding around on a dinosaur and if you don’t think that’s awesome I think something is probably wrong with you, because that has to be ten times cooler than a horse or a Harley Davidson. 

**[00:01:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h01m22s)**  Of course it is not as easy as in Jurassic Park, because DNA does get preserved for millions of years, but we will see today how you could do it anyway. 

**[00:01:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h01m32s)**  How this technology can be used to recreate long extinct species and even engineer ones that never existed, like unicorns or chupacabra. 

**[00:01:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h01m40s)**  Or even things which probably could not naturally evolve, like dragons or multi-headed hydras or intelligent trees. 

**[00:01:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h01m47s)**  We also have potential practical applications, not just stuff like a species of corn that grows twice as much food or some algae that could tailored to be perfect for making biofuels and plastics but less obvious stuff like roads that grew and repaired themselves in ways similar to how coral reefs work or plants that could suck trace metals right out of the ground so we could harvest them rather than needed to mine them. 

**[00:02:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m10s)**  Or even plants that might replace solar panels and let you just plug in to the field or forest for electricity. 

**[00:02:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m16s)**  Stuff that just could not evolve naturally. 

**[00:02:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m19s)**  Which does bring up the question of how we do this stuff and if it is ethical to do it. 

**[00:02:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m25s)**  Yes it should be possible to make an intelligent tree or a human-horse hybrid, a centaur, or a human-fish hybrid, a mermaid, but is it ethical to do so? 

**[00:02:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m36s)**  And how do we do so? 

**[00:02:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m38s)**  For the ‘how?’ part there are a lot of options, but there are four approaches I wanted to look at briefly today. 

**[00:02:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m46s)**  One is CRISPR, an exciting new technology people have been talking about a lot. 

**[00:02:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m50s)**  Another is similar, use of retroviruses to go enact changes to DNA throughout an organism. 

**[00:02:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h02m56s)**  The third is straight DNA Printing, which gives us the option to make strands of DNA from scratch straight off a computer model. 

**[00:03:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h03m03s)**  And lastly we have the option of using nanotechnology, the Universal Assemblers we discussed some episodes back, to just get in there and make the changes at the molecular level if necessary. 

**[00:03:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h03m14s)**  Before we jump into those, and we will be keeping them brief, I did want to take moment to differentiate Bioforming from Gene-Tailoring and both from Genetic Engineering. 

**[00:03:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h03m24s)**  Bioforming we discussed in passing back in the Terraforming episode, as the alternative to Terraforming. 

**[00:03:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h03m30s)**  When terraforming a planet you are trying to make it more Earth-like so people and Terran Flora and Fauna can live there. 

**[00:03:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h03m37s)**  Bioforming, sometimes also called Pantropy, is the reverse, where you adapt Earth Organisms to live in Alien Environments. 

**[00:03:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h03m46s)**  This does not necessarily have to be all that high-tech or alien, if you are dealing with a world already a lot like Earth but devoid of life. 

**[00:03:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h03m54s)**  If it is not much like Earth, or already has life on it, you probably need to do some massive overhauling. 

**[00:04:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h04m01s)**  Outside of science fiction you cannot land on an alien world with alien plants and animals and start eating them or introducing your own plants and animals. 

**[00:04:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h04m09s)**  In all probability the best thing that will happen if you eat a bunch of alien fruits and nuts is that you will get very sick and spend a lot of time in the bathroom expelling those things from one or another of your orifices. 

**[00:04:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h04m23s)**  A lot our own plants can be quite toxic, heck, as I was reminded when watching a recent episode of Cody’s Lab, a lot of regular edible plants contain cyanide, just in low enough dosages that we have adapted to be able to survive eating them. 

**[00:04:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h04m36s)**  There might be some planets that work on similar enough biochemistry that you can eat the food, or some of it, but in all probability you cannot and if you introduce Terran Flora and Fauna either it will die out or it will wipe out the native life. 

**[00:04:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h04m53s)**  Most of us would say those would be bad things, so the alternative is a fairly massive overhaul of our organisms to mix in with those native to that planet. 

**[00:05:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h05m03s)**  This doesn’t necessarily mean tinkering with humans themselves, we might be able to make microorganisms we can introduce into our guts to helps us digest the food, but tinkering with humans themselves is on the table for today. 

**[00:05:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h05m16s)**  So, obviously, is the ethical issue attached to that. 

**[00:05:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h05m21s)**  Gene Tailoring is a bit different, it has no formal definition but it comes with an assumption you are making unnatural changes to an organism. 

**[00:05:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h05m30s)**  It would not just be replacing a defective gene in a person with the one of the other existing versions of it in other people but probably making up a new gene from scratch, which is where DNA printing comes in. 

**[00:05:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h05m41s)**  So for instance, color blindness tends to be hereditary and red-green color blindness, which affects a pretty large chunk of the male populace, could be fixed by taking the functional gene from someone without color blindness and sticking it in the color blind person. 

**[00:05:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h05m56s)**  This is controversial but not nearly as much so as the idea of taking some genes that let you develop cones in your eyes able to infrared light and putting them into a person. 

**[00:06:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h06m06s)**  Either adapted from some other critter or cooking them up in a lab from scratch, or just on a computer model and printing them. 

**[00:06:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h06m13s)**  So for the purpose of this video, when I say Bioforming I am talking about altering an organism to exist in some new environment, rather than altering the environment, though you could do both. 

**[00:06:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h06m24s)**  When I saw gene tailoring I am talking about alterations to people through genetics beyond the basic form. 

**[00:06:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h06m31s)**  So not so much replacing a defective gene which causes diabetes or near-sightedness, and more about giving yourself a body that can win Olympic medals without practice or eyes that can see infrared radiation or getting wings grafted on to your body or a becoming a horse from the torso down. 

**[00:06:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h06m48s)**  This also includes the mental aspects, improving or altering the brain or nervous system, as opposed to just fixing problems like Dementia or Alzheimer's or my own more benign neurological condition that makes my hands tremble and face twitch but otherwise leaves me sound in mind and body. 

**[00:07:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h07m04s)**  It would be nice if we could snip out the defective genes causing that sort of thing and by and large those are not considered particularly controversial. 

**[00:07:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h07m12s)**  There are folks who think even doing things like that is going too far, but too be fair there are people whose definition of natural would seem to exclude anything more advanced than sharp sticks and fire. 

**[00:07:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h07m26s)**  I’m never entirely clear why I often encounter these people on the internet, but I think maybe smartphones and tablets are exempted from their worldview of evil technology. 

**[00:07:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h07m36s)**  Of course that itself is a good example of bias since I am well aware that various primitivist approaches have wildly different technologies they disapprove of and reasons for doing so. 

**[00:07:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h07m48s)**  For some it is simply about self-reliance and personal challenge, and it isn’t like we mock mountain climbers for not taking a helicopter to the mountain peak. 

**[00:07:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h07m57s)**  We will be discussing the ethics of this stuff and trying for some neutrality, and indeed there are a lot of strong arguments against some applications of this sort of technology and a lot of others types too, but there is also a line between reasonable concerns and the ridiculous. 

**[00:08:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h08m13s)**  I can easily respect the opinion of someone who thinks engineering people for higher intelligence is dangerous, but while can respect a person who believes we should not use unnatural chemicals as medicine, in favor of all-natural approaches, I cannot respect their view on the matter. 

**[00:08:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h08m30s)**  Simply their right to have that view and their right to expect courtesy equal to what they offer me. 

**[00:08:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h08m35s)**  It’s a hazy line but I will try to keep on the proper side of it for today. 

**[00:08:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h08m41s)**  So let us talk about methods, and again I want to keep this fairly brief. 

**[00:08:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h08m46s)**  I outlined four a few minutes ago. 

**[00:08:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h08m48s)**  CRISPR, retroviruses, DNA printing, and Universal Assemblers. 

**[00:08:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h08m54s)**  Those are just some of the methods and I wanted to touch on certain aspects of each before we move on. 

**[00:09:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h09m00s)**  CRISPR has become a big news item and you can get details about how it works elsewhere, but essentially a CRISPR is a chunk of DNA where you get a repeating pattern, the pattern is the same forwards and backwards and is short, twenty to forty base pairs, essentially a sentence long snippet in the bookshelf that is your DNA. 

**[00:09:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h09m19s)**  That sentence keeps repeating but in between it are short bits, the equivalent of single words, called Spacer DNA, and those don’t repeat, each one is different and it looks like they are essentially identifiers for pesky viruses and such your body has encountered before. 

**[00:09:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h09m37s)**  When it encounters new ones it lays in another segment, a new bit of Spacer DNA and another repetition of that sentence. 

**[00:09:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h09m44s)**  That’s CRISPR. 

**[00:09:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h09m45s)**  But nearby that segment is an associated sequence, a CRISPR Associated or Cas gene. 

**[00:09:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h09m52s)**  These basically can unzip DNA and cut it up, and are a major part of our immune system. 

**[00:09:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h09m57s)**  What make it handy for genetics is that we can take the Cas and attach something else to it, a sentence of our choosing. 

**[00:10:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m04s)**  And if we stuck it in a cell it would go find anything that looked like that and can add or delete it. 

**[00:10:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m11s)**  So the CRISPR/Cas-9 stuff you keep hearing about is essentially hijacking an existing part of us, one that prevents viruses from hijacking our cells, and using it to snip out bad DNA. 

**[00:10:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m23s)**  And it shows amazing promise as a tool to be used to let us cut out or add or modify DNA. 

**[00:10:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m30s)**  Before this the popular talk was often of retroviruses. 

**[00:10:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m34s)**  In most viruses DNA is transcribed into RNA, then translated into proteins. 

**[00:10:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m40s)**  Retroviruses do that somewhat backward, their RNA gets transcribed into the host’s DNA which starts making copies. 

**[00:10:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m48s)**  Like CRISPR we have the option of hijacking this to be used to modify DNA. 

**[00:10:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m53s)**  Of course you could get into someone’s DNA with very tiny forceps and scalpels and change it. 

**[00:10:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h10m59s)**  The problem is that for any case where you are not working on a single cell embryo, like an adult human with trillions of cells, it is kind of hard to get at all those trillions of DNA helixes and alter each and everyone one. 

**[00:11:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h11m13s)**  DNA printing, which is just spitting out the chemicals that make up DNA one molecule at a time in the right sequence, is obviously handy for letting us make one copy of DNA, we can make anything our minds can imagine and which is chemically possible. 

**[00:11:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h11m28s)**  The problem, besides us needing a way to deliver changes to trillions of cells, is that DNA is very long. 

**[00:11:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h11m36s)**  And while we always show DNA as a pair of long strands, it generally is like a big ball of yarn, not like a long wire hanging between two transmission towers. 

**[00:11:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h11m46s)**  It’s got something like 3 billion base pairs for a human, and genes usually are made up several thousands base pairs and you’ve got several thousand genes in your DNA. 

**[00:11:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h11m57s)**  A normal ball of yarn might be a few hundred meters long, a few times longer than a football field, but our DNA yarn ball, if it were normal yarn width, would be thousands of kilometers long. 

**[00:12:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h12m09s)**  An individual gene would often be as long as a football field. 

**[00:12:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h12m13s)**  When the whole thing wraps up in a ball it would be about your size. 

**[00:12:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h12m18s)**  Needless to say printing something out, one hairbreadth at a time but thousands of kilometers long is pretty time consuming. 

**[00:12:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h12m25s)**  So DNA printing is awesome for making one segment, one gene, or even one complete set of DNA, but not for mass manufacturing billions and trillions of copies for every cell in a body. 

**[00:12:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h12m39s)**  That’s what CRISPR, retroviruses, and some other techniques are for. 

**[00:12:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h12m43s)**  What is cool about DNA printing is you do not need an existing gene, you can design one from scratch, so we do not have to find fossilized DNA from a dinosaur to make one, we can just make educated guesses about what it needs and compile it from scratch on computer. 

**[00:12:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h12m59s)**  We can then print it, stuff it into an egg, and proceed. 

**[00:13:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h13m03s)**  And if we like we can give them a temperament and intelligence more in line with, say, a horse. 

**[00:13:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h13m09s)**  Of course that is essentially turning DNA and RNA and viruses into machines, which they already are but I mean in the artificial sense. 

**[00:13:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h13m19s)**  We can potentially skip that by using the sorts of tiny little nanomachines we have talked about before, particularly the kind called a Universal Assembler, or specifically the Universal Molecular Assembler. 

**[00:13:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h13m32s)**  Which you can tell to build a copy of itself or tell to go find a bit of DNA and cut it up and assemble it how you want. 

**[00:13:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h13m39s)**  Now my main reason for mentioning this one is that I like to remind people that we do not have to use and either or approach with technology. 

**[00:13:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h13m49s)**  Fiction likes to show us futures where people are genetically engineered supermen or cyborgs, not both. 

**[00:13:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h13m55s)**  They tend to skip that such critters would probably be both, even from birth. 

**[00:14:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h14m00s)**  Same as we have mitochondria in us that is effectively an alien organism present in every cell in your body, you could have machine DNA equivalents that hung around doing jobs like replacing an organism's bones with hollow titanium or growing the various brain implants contemplated in Transhumanism. 

**[00:14:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h14m17s)**  There are no unicorns, or at least I’ve never seen one or met anyone who has, at least while sober, but a horse with a horn on it is not exactly a weird thing that could never evolve naturally. 

**[00:14:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h14m30s)**  Horns are handy and common features in nature so there probably is some planet somewhere that’s got them. 

**[00:14:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h14m37s)**  Alternatively something like a dragon, I mean a giant flying reptile that weighs more than elephant and breathes fire, well that is not too likely. 

**[00:14:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h14m46s)**  Dragons are also awesome so science fiction is full of plenty of examples of them where the author spends a lot of time fudging around with how they could exist with some gene-tailoring. 

**[00:14:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h14m55s)**  Maybe so, but they can certainly exist if you do not mind going a bit above and beyond genetic engineering to include either DNA that can make little machines too, or symbiotic passengers like mitochondria. 

**[00:15:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h15m08s)**  So your dragon is otherwise organic but it’s got hollow bones made of titanium or kevlar or graphene and maybe its wings and scales incorporate those features to make it very strong and light. 

**[00:15:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h15m20s)**  Maybe you include a photosynthetic element on the wings so it can feed itself partly on sunlight when it stretches out to subathe on the noon-time desert sands. 

**[00:15:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h15m30s)**  There’s no rule that says a genetically engineered plant could not suck metals out of the ground and weave them into its own structure to make it sturdier than what cellulose and lignin permit. 

**[00:15:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h15m41s)**  Maybe it is incorporated into their core structure or maybe they deposit it like coral into a long spire they grow up around. 

**[00:15:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h15m49s)**  So you can modify the existing organism or make one up from scratch, and a lot of time you will need to modify the brain for many of things I’ll mention in a moment too, you cannot just give someone cones in their eyeballs that are sensitive to infrared and ultraviolet light and expect them to see new colors beyond the rainbow, you need to get in the brain and do some re-wiring too. 

**[00:16:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h16m12s)**  Uplifting, the name for when you take an animal and give it a human-level intelligence, tends to assume the reverse case. 

**[00:16:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h16m19s)**  For better eyes that can see additional colors we need to tinker with the brain also, but for a better mind on a cat or dog or dolphin we might need to tinker with the physical form too. 

**[00:16:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h16m31s)**  Giving them different vocal cords or more nimble toes that can grasp tools. 

**[00:16:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h16m36s)**  Probably tinkering with its reproductive system too since a lot of animals reproduce much more quickly than us and with intelligence and tool use comes a much lower chance of natural death. 

**[00:16:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h16m47s)**  Not what we usually mean these days as a euphemism for old age. 

**[00:16:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h16m51s)**  In nature a natural death usually means ending as someone’s dinner and before you’ve reproduced, which you can do much younger than humans can which is important since humans live a long time and take a long time to develop during which we need a lot more parental care and attention. 

**[00:17:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h17m09s)**  So if you are uplifting animals to make them sentient and sapient you probably need to be thinking about a lot of other things you need to accompany with that. 

**[00:17:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h17m18s)**  Like longer lives, tool using hands, slower reproductive rates with single births not litters, and slower maturation rates. 

**[00:17:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h17m27s)**  So you can use it to make your pets smarter or maybe make entirely new pets like that cute critter from the old gremlins movie, or real life pokemon. 

**[00:17:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h17m36s)**  Now, what people might do to themselves doesn’t interest me all that much except in terms of pondering the ethics. 

**[00:17:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h17m44s)**  I honestly do not much care if someone wants to get their body tweaked, genetically or cybernetically, so they are ten feet tall and built like a linebacker with a souped up heart to support all that new mass. 

**[00:17:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h17m57s)**  Needless to say it could be used to let people switch genders or be both genders or neither. 

**[00:18:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h18m02s)**  Or if they feel like getting scales or fur or feathers or a third eye or extra pair of arms. 

**[00:18:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h18m08s)**  That could look pretty awesome or scary or disgusting, but again it is Halloween when this episode comes out so I’m content with scary. 

**[00:18:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h18m17s)**  What does interest me is useful applications, a type of corn that can use more light to grow with for instance. 

**[00:18:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h18m25s)**  Our plants mostly use red light for photosynthesis and don’t use much green or infrared, and most of what the sun emits is infrared light, and most stars in the galaxy emit even more of their light in that part of the spectrum. 

**[00:18:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h18m40s)**  Our yellow ‘dwarf’ star out masses about 95% of stars and is hotter than them, meaning that it produces much more of its light in the visible range than they do. 

**[00:18:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h18m51s)**  Needless to say a little tweak that let plants use that spectrum for growth could hugely increase the biomass on a planet or make terraforming planets around other stars much easier. 

**[00:19:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h19m03s)**  It would be pretty neat to be able to tinker with how plants deal with carbon and carbon dioxide to be able to use it to sequester carbon out of the atmosphere. 

**[00:19:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h19m12s)**  The strongest materials we have now are made out of carbon so it would be nice to suck the excess out of the air and maybe put it to use making those. 

**[00:19:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h19m22s)**  It would also be neat to have plants that could be planted on toxic soil full of heavy metals and not only thrive but maybe have fruits that grew on them full of those metals, so we could collect them for reuse or safe disposal. 

**[00:19:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h19m37s)**  We cold have vats of black algae that used the entire spectrum to grow very quickly and could be turned into biofuel or plastics, algae is already very promising in this regard but one tailored to use every ounce of energy it got shined on it would be even better. 

**[00:19:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h19m55s)**  Trees that grew meat… sounds kind of freaky, but if it’s identical to bacon in taste and chemistry, it’s nicer than killing a pig, I’d say. 

**[00:20:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h20m04s)**  So you could make a cow that produced more milk, which we’ve been doing through selective breeding for centuries, or you could cut out the middleman and have a bunch of bacteria that just grew milk. 

**[00:20:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h20m15s)**  And since apparently almost everything tastes like chicken I’d imagine we could find a recipe for growing that too, we have been making pretty good strides in lab grown meat after all. 

**[00:20:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h20m26s)**  So plants that could produce their own fertilizers, plants that can maybe suck the trace amounts of valuable minerals out regular soil and concentrate it for you, essentially plants that can be used as machines for specific purposes, in this case mining. 

**[00:20:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h20m41s)**  You might be able to grow computers, you might be able to have organic structures that grew according to blueprint and repaired themselves. 

**[00:20:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h20m50s)**  You might be able to grow solar panels as plants. 

**[00:20:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h20m54s)**  Maybe you could make roads that repaired themselves too, with some equivalent to how coral reefs work or critters that grow shells. 

**[00:21:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h21m02s)**  Maybe you don’t need vats of algae growing biofuel but can have a tree that you can tap for ethanol like we do for maple syrup. 

**[00:21:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h21m10s)**  Maybe you can make an organism that will actually grow plastic, shiny transparent plastic, in some nice dome form that you can use for greenhouses in the desert or domes on Mars. 

**[00:21:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h21m22s)**  Plants designed to live in toxic atmospheres or ones to dense or thin for life or ones designed from the ground up to live in the vacuum of space. 

**[00:21:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h21m32s)**  You could potential create entire ecosphere in a solar system. 

**[00:21:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h21m36s)**  Maybe ones that could migrate between solar systems and seed whole galaxies. 

**[00:21:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h21m42s)**  Lots of random ideas tossed out there, some probably are absurd, some others probably are not but sound that way. 

**[00:21:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h21m49s)**  Just some imagination fuel, when this topic got suggested it came attached with the request to offer out every crazy idea we might use it for and I think I just nailed that. 

**[00:22:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h22m00s)**  These are potential options for genetic engineering when you open the doors to full blown gene tailoring, especially if you are not just limiting yourself to the strictly organic. 

**[00:22:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h22m11s)**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so we’ve explored the basics of why and how, and we have talked about both some of the useful things we are doing now or might do soon, and a lot of quite zany ideas too. 

**[00:22:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h22m22s)**  So I suppose we ought to raise the ethical issues at last. 

**[00:22:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h22m27s)**  When I started thinking about the ethical aspects though, trying to lay out the arguments for and against, two common themes struck me. 

**[00:22:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h22m35s)**  The first was that almost all of them are not limited to just genetic engineering. 

**[00:22:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h22m41s)**  For instance the ethics of using gene tailoring to enhance human intelligence or strength or endurance is essentially the same as those for using cybernetics to do it or performance enhancing drugs. 

**[00:22:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h22m54s)**  The second is that these were not new arguments. 

**[00:22:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h22m57s)**  We have been using rituals and herbs to try to make people healthier or smarter since long before we had science, and we have been using selective breeding of plants, animals, and even people for a quite long time. 

**[00:23:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h23m10s)**  That science and technology make these things easier, and actually works, is irrelevant. 

**[00:23:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h23m16s)**  Or it would seem so to me. 

**[00:23:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h23m18s)**  In the past we have tried to do these things. 

**[00:23:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h23m21s)**  Sometimes it didn’t work, even if maybe we thought it did, like many of our folk remedies or superstitions, sometimes it did work but imperfectly, also like many of our folk remedies and superstitions. 

**[00:23:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h23m33s)**  Whether it worked or how well it worked does not change the ethics of doing it, for the same reason trying to murder someone with a stage prop sword and failing is still attempted murder. 

**[00:23:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h23m46s)**  So we can say it is unethical to modify children so they grow up to be geniuses with the bodies of supermodels and professional athletes. 

**[00:23:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h23m54s)**  We can say that it is doubly so because it pressures other people to do it to their own children. 

**[00:23:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h23m59s)**  For that matter, what right do we have to modify a person without their informed consent? 

**[00:24:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h24m04s)**  A thing which is impossible with a young child. 

**[00:24:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h24m08s)**  And yet, we already do these things, and have for a long time. 

**[00:24:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h24m12s)**  This does not make it ethical, we do a lot of things we probably should cease doing for ethical reasons and we certainly have tons of things we used to do and stopped doing because they were unethical. 

**[00:24:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h24m23s)**  And yet we can frame many of the ethical issues of genetic engineering in the context of existing ethical issues. 

**[00:24:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h24m32s)**  Throughout history we had tons of cultures that engaged in selective breeding for traits, and they knew they were doing it. 

**[00:24:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h24m40s)**  People often do make decisions for their children, someone has to, and often those are not ones we would applaud. 

**[00:24:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h24m47s)**  People already do feel pressured to do things to benefit their children which are questionable and do try to do things to give their child an edge, or to make sure they can keep up with the others. 

**[00:24:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h24m59s)**  The line between encouraging your child to succeed and pressuring your child to do so is decidedly thin and ill-defined. 

**[00:25:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h25m08s)**  Is it ethical to alter DNA? 

**[00:25:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h25m11s)**  I don’t know but we’ve been doing it, deliberately, for generations, and the only difference is we did not know what DNA was. 

**[00:25:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h25m20s)**  Is it ethical to alter someone’s DNA without their consent? 

**[00:25:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h25m23s)**  I don’t know but it seems to me that it is akin to any other situation where you would act without the target’s consent. 

**[00:25:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h25m32s)**  It may be wrong to force someone to have surgery to remove a brain tumor, even though it is clearly damaging their judgement and ability to make informed decisions. 

**[00:25:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h25m42s)**  But if that is not unethical, why would it be so to give gene therapy to correct a similar ailment, like Dementia? 

**[00:25:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h25m50s)**  Similarly, if is okay for people to refuse medical treatments for their children, then it would be for gene therapy too, I should think, and vice-versa if a parent can refuse a life-saving procedure for their child like a donated heart, then they can also refuse the gene therapy which might fix the defect. 

**[00:26:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h26m11s)**  If we cannot ban such things as organ donation, then on what basis would we ban the gene therapy equivalent? 

**[00:26:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h26m18s)**  If we can ban performancing enhancing drugs, can we ban performance enhancing genes, and what is the difference between the two which might make one bad but the other not? 

**[00:26:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h26m30s)**  It may be unethical to tamper with the genes of plants and animals, yet we have done this for a long time too and typically not with that organism's best interest in mind but our own. 

**[00:26:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h26m41s)**  I cannot say I always approve of such things, but regardless, be they right or wrong, they seem little different than intentional genetic alteration, except, again, that we are much more skilled at it doing it. 

**[00:26:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h26m54s)**  And when it comes to bioforming, altering organisms to live in alien environments, I am not sure what the difference is between altering a dog to live on the Planet Dune where it never rains, and altering the local wildlife to adapt to it raining, but it seems no more or less ethical to do that then to wipe out the giant desert sandworms that dwell there and are killed by water or to tinker with them so they can now live in oceans not just the seas of sand. 

**[00:27:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h27m24s)**  So, as is often the case when we talk about the ethics of this or that bit of technology on this channel, we do not come up with a yes or no, but we maybe come away with a clearer picture of what we should be considering. 

**[00:27:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h27m37s)**  I suspect almost every aspect of genetic engineering will have its own case-by-case problems. 

**[00:27:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h27m45s)**  So some food for thought, and I’d be curious to hear what you think about these matters in the comments section of the episode, or over on the Facebook or Reddit Groups, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, which are often more conducive to discussion if you want to talk with others about the ideas we looked at today. 

**[00:28:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h28m03s)**  Next week is going to be my collaboration episode with Joe Scott, where we will look at Dark Flow &amp; the Great Attractor. 

**[00:28:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1nZn3gMHPxg&t=00h28m09s)**  The week after that will be the Stellar Compendium, where we are going to look at the big zoo of star types, including the strange ones, and demystify some of the terms used to discuss them.
