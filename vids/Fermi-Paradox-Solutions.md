What we’ll be doing here today is reviewing some of the more common proposed solutions to the Fermi Paradox – which is essentially the question ‘if there are aliens, why can’t we see them?’ – and look over some of the strengths and weaknesses of those solutions. 

**[00:00:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h00m19s)**  There are a lot of them so we’ll be moving fairly quickly over each, and we’ll also loosely categorize them into some groups. 

**[00:00:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h00m32s)**  No grouping is really ideal but they are helpful so here are the ones I’ve selected: Category 1: Alien Civilizations are Incredibly Uncommon. 

**[00:00:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h00m45s)**  There are no alien civilizations, or they are so incredibly rare that most galaxies have never spawned one. 

**[00:00:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h00m55s)**  Category 2: They are common but hard to see. 

**[00:00:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h00m58s)**  There are alien civilizations but we can’t hear them. 

**[00:01:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h01m04s)**  Category 3: They exist and are not hard to see. 

**[00:01:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h01m07s)**  We interact with them routinely but most or all don’t realize it. 

**[00:01:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h01m13s)**  Category 4: Miscellaneous. 

**[00:01:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h01m15s)**  Or in more generalized form, Category 1, we can’t see aliens because they don’t exist, Category 2 we can’t see them because we’re not looking hard enough or in the right way, category 3 we can’t see them because we’re being tricked or tricking ourselves, and category 4 we have a massive flaw in our logic where this paradox is concerned. 

**[00:01:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h01m39s)**  Category 1 we’ll cover pretty quickly because first I recently did a lengthy video discussing it in enormous detail and second it’s the camp I loosely align to so I’m not great at criticizing it. 

**[00:01:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h01m54s)**  But inside Category 1 you basically have three subdivisions. 

**[00:01:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h01m59s)**  1A: The conditions needed to achieve complex life are much less common than we assume. 

**[00:02:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h02m07s)**  1B: Intelligence is not a common outcome of evolution, or Intelligence does not lead to technological civilizations. 

**[00:02:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h02m16s)**  1C: Intelligence in this Universe does not occur naturally. 

**[00:02:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h02m24s)**  Category 1A is fairly broad but essentially comes down to the notion of Great Filters and the Rare Earth Hypothesis. 

**[00:02:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h02m31s)**  In the Fermi Paradox a Great Filter is something which assumes a lot of steps on the road to becoming a technological civilization and staying there for long enough to be seen and heard. 

**[00:02:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h02m42s)**  Sometimes this is a single filter, like an assumption all or nearly all civilizations nuke themselves out of existence within a century of making a nuclear bomb, but just as often it can be a series of filters that each have a large chance of enduring the journey. 

**[00:02:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h02m58s)**  1 in 10 stars can host habitable planets, one in ten of those worlds develop life, one tenth of those get complex life, one tenth of those luck out on some cataclysm or change that wipes out complex life too frequently to go further or makes it so it can’t continue, one tenth develop life with significant brains, one tenth of those achieve intelligence, one tenth of those develop technology, and one tenth of those avoid wiping themselves out. 

**[00:03:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h03m25s)**  That’s 8 one tenths, or 1 in 100 million. 

**[00:03:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h03m30s)**  Which would still result in several thousands of civilizations in this galaxy alone but if the odds were one in a hundred each step that would be less than one per several thousand galaxies and explain why we hadn’t detected them. 

**[00:03:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h03m51s)**  There’s also potential criteria that might be uncommon but required for complex life, like having a large moon or Jupiter to vacuum up space debris so it doesn’t rain down on the planet regularly or that conditions on planets are very prone to toppling out of habitability. 

**[00:04:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h04m10s)**  Here are some of those, and again we won’t really be challenging these as much as we will in other categories: Planetary habitable zones are narrow and move as stars age. 

**[00:04:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h04m22s)**  We classify habitable zones basically as where liquid water can exist on something of near-Earth size but that’s a pretty big guess, and planets don’t move in circular orbits but ellipses. 

**[00:04:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h04m35s)**  Planets might ice over or tilt into runaway greenhouse effects far more easily then we currently assume. 

**[00:04:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h04m41s)**  Additionally, the luminosity of stars changes over time, they get brighter, that pushes the habitable zone outward. 

**[00:04:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h04m51s)**  Many also fluctuate in brightness much more than our Sun, and give off regular deluges of light, like XUV radiation, which is inimical to life, not just Earth life but any life based on regular chemistry. 

**[00:05:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h05m05s)**  Jovian planets are rare: The notion that a planet will get bombarded by asteroids without some other larger body around to pull those in is a fairly valid one but this idea has fallen out of favor as a strong filter because we’ve detected so many planets in other solar systems that parallel Jupiter in size and location to perform the vacuum cleaner function. 

**[00:05:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h05m35s)**  Large moons are rare: Earth’s own moon is very nearly a double planet and it has a huge impact on our environment in terms of tides, weather, our axial tilt, and so on. 

**[00:05:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h05m47s)**  It is usually assumed that early land life evolved from creatures that had evolved to handle tide pools. 

**[00:05:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h05m53s)**  No big moon, no tides. 

**[00:05:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h05m55s)**  Geological events have to be just right for complex life: A planet with no volcanoes or plate tectonics is going to erode away into a massive flat mudball or landless sea which is not well suited for diverse complex life let alone tool using life. 

**[00:06:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h06m14s)**  And we have many others. 

**[00:06:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h06m16s)**  Cells with nuclei develop rarely, specialized organisms with distinct organs are not common, galaxies are volatile place which often expose worlds to sterilizing blasts of radiation, and so on. 

**[00:06:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h06m29s)**  Individually one of these might be a Great Filter that fewer than one in a billion pass or they may each just be something that just drops the odds of life by an order or two of magnitude which adds up to making complex life rare. 

**[00:06:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h06m44s)**  The big ‘flaw’ here is that we really just don’t know the odds and none of them seem to work as a single Great Filter. 

**[00:06:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h06m52s)**  None of those really seem like one in a billion type things and many are not even indicated to be less likely than not, let alone highly improbable, so stacking them all into a sequence that makes complex life rare is sort of like assuming the worst case scenario has happened each step along the way. 

**[00:07:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h07m11s)**  Category 1B: That intelligence or technological civilizations are rare isn’t necessarily separate from 1A, since it can just be additional layers of filtering, but is distinct in that it argues that technological civilizations may be a freak anomaly and not an inevitable end goal of evolution. 

**[00:07:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h07m33s)**  Now, of course, evolutions does not have end goals but it does tend to produce increased complexity and sophistication and we often assume intelligence to be one of those and technology inevitable from that. 

**[00:07:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h07m48s)**  The other chunk of 1B is that tech civs might be uncommon because they inevitably take themselves out through nukes, biological warfare, runaway self-replicating machines, and so on. 

**[00:08:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h08m02s)**  1B is complicated because ‘intelligence’ is a bit hard to define. 

**[00:08:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h08m08s)**  Humans are the only ‘intelligent’ life on Earth but of course are not. 

**[00:08:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h08m13s)**  Besides other primates like chimpanzees we have cats, dogs, dolphins, elephants, pigs, raccoons, and many other creatures who we’re tens of millions of years away from in terms of common ancestors and yet have clear intelligence, problem solving abilities, and even tool use or building skills. 

**[00:08:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h08m36s)**  Many have had this level of intelligence for a very, very long time even on geological timelines and yet never carried it any further. 

**[00:08:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h08m46s)**  Now many assume humans just hit the complex tool use level first and that if we disappeared eventually one of them would get there but our brains, with the large, folded forebrain and cerebral cortex is a pretty big jump and there are a lot of little factors in our biology that probably contributed to our rise as a technological civilization which are peculiar or sometimes even harmful to us. 

**[00:09:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h09m18s)**  We have large heads with skulls that are soft so they can expand later, and this is very dangerous for live birth, additionally that soft skull probably is a big factor in the plasticity of our brains which is very associated to learning, and a need for learning since you don’t have as many wired instincts. 

**[00:09:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h09m36s)**  It’s not just that you can learn, it is that you must learn. 

**[00:09:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h09m42s)**  We are omnivores, cats aren’t, they can probably never develop specialist societies because they can’t support a dense population through agriculture and everything they eat is terrified of them making it probably fairly hard to get into tending livestock. 

**[00:09:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h09m58s)**  Even if you get the brain, and tool use, which we’ve had for hundreds of thousands of years, you might not use technology much. 

**[00:10:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h10m07s)**  We have fire, but that might not be popular. 

**[00:10:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h10m11s)**  We cook our food, which allows us store meat longer and also let’s us digest certain types of it better to derive more nutrient from it. 

**[00:10:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h10m20s)**  A given critter might hate the taste of cooked food. 

**[00:10:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h10m24s)**  Or the oxygen content of their world might be a little higher making forest fires the most dreaded bane and the very idea of someone keeping it around the tribe considered the equivalent of juggling hand grenades. 

**[00:10:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h10m44s)**  Fire’s dangerous as is, but its exponentially more so as oxygen concentrations rise and you need it for technology. 

**[00:10:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h10m55s)**  Some worlds, from different levels of tectonic activity or erosion, or just composition, might not have easy to find copper to make those first metal tools limiting you to flint and wood, which can not be used to make some tools well enough to make them better than employing old school methods. 

**[00:11:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h11m16s)**  Pottery will never develop if you don’t have fire either. 

**[00:11:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h11m19s)**  Planets with no seasons, or very mild ones, will not require means of preserving food. 

**[00:11:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h11m26s)**  Tidally locked worlds will never see the stars where life can live, so no astrology or astronomy, or the world might have thin clouds almost constantly. 

**[00:11:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h11m43s)**  The world might not have large deposit of fossil fuels. 

**[00:11:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h11m46s)**  And so on. 

**[00:11:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h11m50s)**  So essentially Category 1B challenges the idea that evolution will inevitably spawn technology, and throws in the caveat that technology might also inevitably kill a world too. 

**[00:12:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h12m11s)**  Its big flaw is that we while we know evolution we really don’t have a clue about the probabilities involved on given steps nor do we know if we might stumble across some bit of seemingly great technology that amounts to signing a suicide contract by employing it. 

**[00:12:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h12m29s)**  Self-replicating robots, a power source that makes fusion look shoddy but blows up a planet after a few years of operation, etc. 

**[00:12:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h12m38s)**  Category 1C, that Intelligence in this Universe does not occur naturally, covers more of the supernatural cases though also includes the extreme version of 1B that a freak anomaly had to occur, rather than an improbable but natural evolutionary jump. 

**[00:12:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h12m56s)**  If you’ve ever heard of Boltzmann Brain, essentially the notion that over a long enough time in a big enough place random events could make a computer assemble not through evolution but just freak odds, that’s basically the reasoning there. 

**[00:13:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h13m18s)**  But this category includes ‘God did it’, or ‘aliens in a prior universe with different rules made this one’, or the near equivalent, that we’re running in a simulation of a universe where the laws differ from the simulators and intelligence would not naturally develop so they tweaked us specifically so it would. 

**[00:13:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h13m38s)**  If we wanted to simulate a universe on giant computers where, say, the speed of light was 10% higher and found out that life could exist but just couldn’t naturally evolve, that the steps to get there were just too improbable to occur, we might just throw them in ready-made on one world to see what happened afterwards. 

**[00:13:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h13m59s)**  1C is not the scientifically popular realm but in truth many of the other solutions we’ll see are much akin so leaving it out would be unfair. 

**[00:14:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h14m11s)**  It has the obvious flaw that there’s no scientific evidence to support and that most versions are ‘internally unprovable’, meaning that while an outside force that did it can come on down and say ‘hi’ you can’t, inside the box, ever show that’s what’s going on. 

**[00:14:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h14m36s)**  Even in the case of a Boltzmann brain, one that assembled complete from particles with no evolutionary steps, it would be on sound ground to wonder if someone made it rather than assuming it was an astronomically improbable fluke event, even though it knows that is possible. 

**[00:14:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h14m55s)**  A clock can assemble naturally, the odds of this occurring are just very, very low so outside covert construction isn’t too absurd if you find one. 

**[00:15:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h15m10s)**  So that’s category 1, we don’t see aliens because they are super rare or don’t even exist. 

**[00:15:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h15m19s)**  Category 2, they are common but hard to see. 

**[00:15:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h15m22s)**  There are alien civilizations but we can’t hear them. 

**[00:15:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h15m26s)**  This is where most of the argument goes on and where we’ll spend most of our time. 

**[00:15:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h15m32s)**  It’s harder to break into sub-categories but here are the major ones: 2A: They’ve got mouths but we lack ears. 

**[00:15:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h15m41s)**  Typically that means they just don’t use radio for communication 2B: There just hasn’t been enough time for us to hear them. 

**[00:15:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h15m51s)**  2C: They don’t talk because they have no reason to. 

**[00:15:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h15m56s)**  2D: They hide, intentionally The biggest flaws going into category 2 are the Mediocrity Principle and the idea of Exclusivity. 

**[00:16:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h16m08s)**  Mediocrity Principle we know, when you’ve only got one example of something you should assume it’s probably a fairly normal, or mediocre, example of such things. 

**[00:16:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h16m18s)**  It comes into category 2 because frequently this category relies on choices and behavior of alien civilizations and they probably have little similarity to humans in many areas, they are, literally, alien. 

**[00:16:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h16m31s)**  However they also just as probably have that same alien-ness to each other. 

**[00:16:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h16m36s)**  A given alien civilization might act in some way, but others won’t. 

**[00:16:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h16m41s)**  Unless that behavior is exclusive. 

**[00:16:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h16m45s)**  As an example, we can assume that no species that ever explores the stars or settles other worlds hasn’t learned basic Newtonian physics, you need that to build rockets, you can’t avoid seeing it in action very simplistically in space even if you somehow got up there without it or evolved in an asteroid belt or deep space instead. 

**[00:17:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h17m06s)**  There’s no air friction interfering with the basic process. 

**[00:17:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h17m10s)**  So we can say that space travel is ‘exclusive’ to species who know Newtonian Physics. 

**[00:17:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h17m15s)**  However, while many people believe in the inevitability of social progress to some predetermined and universal system of behavior, and often have some good arguments to back that, it’s pretty obvious that just among humans it is possible to get up into space with many different types of culture. 

**[00:17:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h17m34s)**  So it is hard to argue that space travel is exclusive to democracies, or communist civilizations, or ones which have curbed population growth or given up war, etc. 

**[00:17:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h17m45s)**  Space travel would seem to be non-exclusive of democracy, or human rights, or unchecked population growth, or so on. 

**[00:17:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h17m51s)**  That last will come up a lot because as we discussed in the prior video, the Dyson Dilemma, if a species is prone to keep growing in numbers and territory, even if it’s a very slow growth, even if they are fairly rare they will soon become the super-majority of intelligent life. 

**[00:18:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h18m09s)**  So you’ll hear me reference Non-Exclusivity with a lot of Category 2 solutions. 

**[00:18:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h18m15s)**  2a: They’ve got mouths but we lack ears. 

**[00:18:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h18m21s)**  Again, this typically that means they just don’t use radio for communication. 

**[00:18:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h18m29s)**  This could include something faster than light or even instant, something like neutrinos that just go right through everything, or even just that they don’t use omnidirectional signals, which are pretty wasteful in most cases especially for long distance communication between two spots. 

**[00:18:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h18m54s)**  Even if you’ve got a hundred colony systems around your homeworld it makes more sense to send a tight beam to each system rather than one big omnidirectional signal. 

**[00:19:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h19m07s)**  They talk, but we don’t hear them because they’re talking in sign language and we’re listening with our ears basically. 

**[00:19:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h19m14s)**  This is a pretty solid argument but it suffers from a few problems. 

**[00:19:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h19m18s)**  First, if we don’t know what kind of new physics they are using to talk faster than light we’re not just assuming science we don’t have, we’re also assuming behavior based around something we don’t know. 

**[00:19:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h19m31s)**  We have light speed communication. 

**[00:19:33](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h19m33s)**  We have the internet but people still use fax machines and snail mail. 

**[00:19:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h19m38s)**  We have TV but AM radio remains strong. 

**[00:19:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h19m41s)**  The ability to send instant messages across the stars could be much more expensive, byte for byte, then radio and if so you’d still use that on your planet. 

**[00:19:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h19m52s)**  We don’t know how this thing which breaks known physical laws would operate so it’s a huge jump to say that’s what’s going on. 

**[00:20:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h20m03s)**  Second, this hits the problem in the Dyson Dilemma. 

**[00:20:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h20m06s)**  We may well not be able to hear signals from an alien homeworld, even if they were in mundane radio, but if they are expansionist we don’t need to listen for their homeworld radio, we just need to listen for their colonies. 

**[00:20:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h20m19s)**  Biological life tends to grow with time, when it has the resources to do so and no external pressure stopping them, over a long enough period you don’t need to look thousands of light years away for alien radio signals, you just need to look at any star nearby because they colonized it or someone else did. 

**[00:20:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h20m39s)**  Indeed, there’s no obvious reason you’d need to listen for radio to see those nearby worlds either because they will probably be tapping that star for energy by surrounding it with solar collectors and artificial habitats. 

**[00:20:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h20m55s)**  The Dyson Dilemma basically says it doesn’t matter if we can hear their phone, because any pro-growth civilization decently older than us is going to have surrounded their star and many nearby ones with Dyson Spheres or Dyson Swarms and just keep slowly expanding so you can’t miss them. 

**[00:21:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h21m15s)**  And this is where non-exclusivity comes in. 

**[00:21:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h21m19s)**  Unless one can show that the ability to engage in serious expansion of your own planet is exclusive to species which are no growth or destined to be no growth not long after, then it would only take one species, or even on sub-culture of a species, that was pro-growth to ensure this expansion happened. 

**[00:21:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h21m39s)**  Now, as we mentioned earlier, many people do believe certain behaviors are inevitable as a part of social progress, if you believe that includes no growth even when you can, then category 2A is quite reasonable, if you believe it is not inevitable for all intelligent life, then 2A, and most of category 2, is shot down. 

**[00:22:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h22m06s)**  And again watch the other video if you want that explained in detail. 

**[00:22:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h22m10s)**  This also discusses the problem where civilizations kill themselves off in short order, which again hits the idea of Non-Exclusivity unless you subscribe to that being an inevitable event by any technological species. 

**[00:22:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h22m23s)**  We will assume here that inevitable no growth or inevitable extinction are NOT the case, if you feel otherwise category 2 is a good Fermi Paradox Solution. 

**[00:22:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h22m36s)**  Category 2b: There just hasn’t been enough time for us to hear them. 

**[00:22:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h22m41s)**  This theory holds that technological life is a very recent development, there just hasn’t been enough time for aliens to develop and signals to reach us, and we haven’t been listening long enough to pick up some of the weaker signals. 

**[00:22:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h22m54s)**  Indeed we might be the first intelligent life form, or if they’re a bit rare, the first in this galaxy and the guys in Andromeda beat us to the punch by a hundred thousand years but no signal or sign of mega-engineering like Dyson spheres would have gotten here, two million light years away, yet. 

**[00:23:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h23m12s)**  Life couldn’t evolve to intelligence until relatively recently. 

**[00:23:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h23m17s)**  Now the problem here is just scale. 

**[00:23:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h23m21s)**  There is good reason to believe that complex life might be something that could only exist relatively recently. 

**[00:23:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h23m28s)**  It takes several generations of stars to produce metals, many supernova events, and those same events can sterilize nearby worlds too. 

**[00:23:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h23m36s)**  The problem is that ‘relatively recently’ generally means ‘in the last couple billion years’. 

**[00:23:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h23m43s)**  There are over a million stars within five hundred light years of us, the whole galaxy is within a hundred thousand light years of us, and there a many galaxies a few million to maybe ten million light years from us. 

**[00:23:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h23m59s)**  Those are immense distance with correspondingly immense times for signals to travel or an even larger for ships that can’t go faster than light, or even a good percent of light, to travel. 

**[00:24:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h24m12s)**  But the problem is, as we said, scale. 

**[00:24:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h24m15s)**  A thousand years, or million years, or even ten million years, the often cited figure for colonizing a whole galaxy without any major new physics being discovered, is just a tiny, tiny number compared to even a billion years which based on what we know of the Universe and life ought to be the conservative and late timeline for technological civilizations to have arisen. 

**[00:24:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h24m38s)**  By the Mediocrity principle we must assume that, barring evidence to the contrary, even if no worlds that gave birth to life are older than our star that roughly half will have beaten us to technology by several million years at least, and again there’s no reason we know of why stars a billion years older but otherwise identical wouldn’t have gotten technology a billion years ahead of us. 

**[00:25:04](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h25m04s)**  So if we’re not assuming self-destruction or zero growth are inevitable results of technology and social progress we just have not justification for the idea that there’s not been enough time for signals to have gotten to us yet because they’ve had a billion years of broadcast time and a billion years to expand outward from their homeworld toward us to make those signals easier to see and with less time lag. 

**[00:25:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h25m31s)**  2C: They don’t talk because they have no reason to Examples here would be that they just don’t see a benefit to talking to other aliens, and maybe consider it harmful. 

**[00:25:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h25m47s)**  Maybe they’ve become some single machine intelligence that gains little from going elsewhere and sees nothing to gain by chat except cultural knowledge which it doesn’t value. 

**[00:25:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h25m57s)**  Maybe they’ve all retreated to a simulated universe, a virtual reality utopia, and its much more interesting to them then 1000-year long phone conversations. 

**[00:26:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h26m06s)**  Lots of options here for why they wouldn’t want to talk. 

**[00:26:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h26m10s)**  This one encounters the same problems raised in the Dyson Dilemma, that we don’t need to hear their phones to see they are there if they’ve been expanding. 

**[00:26:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h26m20s)**  But it also double-dips into Non-Exclusivity by assuming none of the aliens, who should all have as radically different behavior from each other as from us, don’t feel a reason to chat with other aliens, even just to broadcast over and over – “This area of space is ours, stay out, we don’t want to talk to you, this is ours, stay out and we will leave you be, come in and we will blow you up, message repeats”. 

**[00:26:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h26m45s)**  It’s already stretching a point to say all aliens aren’t talkative, but to assume they don’t even broadcast to deter accidental invasions is stretching common sense. 

**[00:26:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h26m57s)**  Animals routinely mark their territory and vocally discourage incursions because fighting if you don’t have to is dangerous and cost time and resources. 

**[00:27:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h27m07s)**  Mediocrity principle tells us that animals on at least some other worlds probably do the same and non-Exclusivity would suggest some aliens ought to have giant omnidirectional broadcast arrays just screaming ‘stay out’ even if they are otherwise not chatty. 

**[00:27:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h27m23s)**  There’s also a reverse example of non-exclusivity here, of exclusivity, because while we can’t say that intelligence is exclusive to creatures with curiosity, common sense would indicate that curiosity is not likely to be a rarity among technological civilizations. 

**[00:27:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h27m40s)**  It is hard to imagine they wouldn’t be curious by nature, let alone that this would be the universal rule. 

**[00:27:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h27m47s)**  And unless they are afraid, then it doesn’t have to be the whole species, just a handful of them. 

**[00:27:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h27m52s)**  We’ve no reason to think aliens are more homogenous in behavior and outlook then we ourselves are. 

**[00:28:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m01s)**  So category 2D, maybe they are afraid. 

**[00:28:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m05s)**  Aliens don’t talk, just listen, and actively hide, because they are afraid of being seen and heard. 

**[00:28:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m13s)**  This makes a lot of sense. 

**[00:28:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m15s)**  We have a term called METI, the version of SETI – the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence – which focuses on Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, also called active SETI or positive SETI. 

**[00:28:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m28s)**  METI, in which you intentionally broadcast to aliens, is unlike SETI which passively listens. 

**[00:28:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m34s)**  It is not popular. 

**[00:28:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m38s)**  It is very controversial. 

**[00:28:40](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m40s)**  Many SETI backers outright condemn it, will not support it, and I’ve even heard people suggest it should be considered a Crime against Humanity as its telling potentially hostile aliens how to find us. 

**[00:28:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h28m51s)**  It wouldn’t be too hard to imagine other aliens do exactly that, ban transmission, and maybe even hide more so their world looks uninhabited. 

**[00:29:01](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h29m01s)**  Problem here is that this also hits non-exclusivity. 

**[00:29:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h29m05s)**  Now one can argue that all aliens will come to the conclusion that passive listening rather than broadcast is the path of wisdom but this breaks down over time even if true. 

**[00:29:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h29m16s)**  Again it has to be every member of every species doing it, since it would only take a few people with broadcast equipment. 

**[00:29:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h29m23s)**  But worse, they have to keep doing it. 

**[00:29:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h29m26s)**  How long do you have to wait before you say “Look, we’ve been listening to silence for a million years, hiding here on our one planet for fear of drawing attention. 

**[00:29:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h29m35s)**  Either no one is there or they are like us, just paranoid and hiding, let’s expand.” And if someone replies “Well, what if there is some galaxy-spanning species of xenophobes waiting to see us and jump on us, or killer robots in space quietly waiting for intelligence.” You’d just reply “Then they must be beyond stupid, because they could easily have investigated every single planet in the galaxy by now and even insured no life ever came to be on them in the first place. 

**[00:30:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h30m07s)**  It just isn’t that hard for a determined species capable of wiping us out to have found us in the first place.” And this is pretty solid logic. 

**[00:30:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h30m15s)**  Killer xenocidal species or robots make for good science fiction but also make just about no sense. 

**[00:30:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h30m22s)**  If you were such a species, and could design long lasting and self-repairing robots to purge the galaxy of alien life, why would you settle for leaving a few million outposts all within a hundred or so light years of every world to listen for radio? 

**[00:30:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h30m36s)**  Why not just sterilize every single world that could support life, and rinse and repeat every hundred million years? 

**[00:30:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h30m42s)**  Or if it’s just intelligent life, why even wait for radio signals anyway? 

**[00:30:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h30m46s)**  Why not just leave satellite telescopes near habitable worlds that would sit and stare at those worlds looking for any patterns at all. 

**[00:30:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h30m54s)**  Pull up Google Earth sometime and zoom out till you can see many miles at once. 

**[00:30:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h30m59s)**  Look at a natural area, like a national park, then look at any area settled by man, city or farmland, that is very obvious and requires no radio signals to see, and you’d be able to detect civilizations that way long before they got radios. 

**[00:31:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h31m14s)**  Now in the face of that logic, it is hard to imagine a civilization, having thought of that, just staying hidden at home for millions of years especially considering that by expanding they’d have more resources to deal with an aggressor. 

**[00:31:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h31m30s)**  More scientists to research weapons, more worlds to build weapons, multiple worlds to be safeguarded against natural disasters or surprise attacks. 

**[00:31:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h31m41s)**  So while the idea that aliens just listen and don’t talk is reasonable, the notion that they all do that and keep doing it for hundreds of millions of years is not. 

**[00:31:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h31m55s)**  That’s it for category 2, again fundamentally the problems with category 2 is that unless you believe extinction inevitably results from technology or that all societies evolve to act the same, category 2 suffers from Non-exclusivity. 

**[00:32:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h32m15s)**  There’s just no reason to think they’d all act like that especially when there’s many obvious downsides to doing so. 

**[00:32:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h32m23s)**  Category 3: They exist and are not hard to see. 

**[00:32:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h32m30s)**  We interact with them routinely but most or all don’t realize it. 

**[00:32:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h32m34s)**  We’ll break this into subcategories as well: 3A: Aliens walk among us but hide themselves. 

**[00:32:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h32m44s)**  [X-files] 3B: Aliens used to walk among us and helped us get technological [Alien Astronauts] 3C: Aliens are here, but are so unrecognizable we can’t see them for what they are 3D: We are aliens ourselves Big flaw in #3 is just lack of evidence, but as we discussed way back in category 1C, just because something is very hard or impossible to prove internally doesn’t mean its wrong. 

**[00:33:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h33m13s)**  Many of course believe we do have evidence of aliens walking among us and while I think they’re wrong this wouldn’t be complete if we left out one of the most popular groups of solutions to the Fermi Paradox nor am I going to sit around heaping scorn on them. 

**[00:33:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h33m28s)**  It’s enough, in my book, to say there’s no hard evidence to back these solutions with the caveat that, in fairness, most of the solutions have the exact same problem, only difference being that we can actually gather evidence of stuff here on or near Earth, we can’t get to other worlds yet to examine them. 

**[00:33:47](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h33m47s)**  Decent logic with a lack of evidence because you can’t get it yet get a little more respect tin my book than those where you can obtain evidence. 

**[00:33:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h33m56s)**  So 3A: They walk covertly among us. 

**[00:33:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h33m59s)**  It is impossible to have been raised in modern times and not know a bunch of TV and movie examples of this, and again the evidence for it is either absent or considered by many to be dubious. 

**[00:34:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h34m10s)**  Nothing else to say. 

**[00:34:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h34m13s)**  3B: They used to walk among us. 

**[00:34:16](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h34m16s)**  Ancient Alien Astronauts helping us build the pyramids and similar has shown up in lots of fiction and again we’re all familiar with it. 

**[00:34:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h34m24s)**  For this subcategory there’s tons of evidence, such as the pyramids, but that evidence itself is disputed by arguments that we could and did build such things on our own. 

**[00:34:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h34m35s)**  My only add on to this is two fold. 

**[00:34:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h34m37s)**  First, if they were willing to involve themselves then, what changed to make them stop and why are all the examples here things we could have done without any inclusions of stuff beyond us, like a lighthouse run on passive nuclear reactors or advanced alloys we couldn’t have made period? 

**[00:34:56](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h34m56s)**  Second, and its not an evidence argument, I don’t like 3B because it demeans, in my eyes, the accomplishments of humanity and of individuals who’s efforts were a testament to themselves and humanity, because they didn’t happen in a vacuum. 

**[00:35:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h35m13s)**  That’s not a logic or evidence based argument, but I think it is one worth mentioning anyway. 

**[00:35:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h35m18s)**  3c: Aliens are here, but are so unrecognizable we can’t see them for what they are This sub-category would generally include both aliens who are so non-obviously thinking entities that we overlook them, like a big sentient rock that just parked itself here millennia ago to watch us. 

**[00:35:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h35m38s)**  Or an intelligent gaseous entity that floats around as a cloud and communicates over the course of days by raining or emitting lightning bolts in a pattern we just haven’t seen. 

**[00:35:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h35m49s)**  It might even think it is talking to us and getting responses because it rains on drought-struck areas and we raise around altering that place to grow plants in certain patterns and it’s busy trying to figure out what those are supposed to say. 

**[00:36:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h36m02s)**  When we’re talking about really alien life, physiologically or psychologically, it’s not that hard to imagine we just don’t even see each other as alive or it sees us but cannot figure out how to chat. 

**[00:36:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h36m18s)**  The problem with this is that once you abandon biology or logical behavior as means of detection you haven’t got much of anything to work with and maybe never will. 

**[00:36:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h36m31s)**  There’s no evidence for or against and you’re basically left just shrugging and saying ‘Could be, maybe” 3d: We are aliens Its often been suggested that human intelligence is the result of alien tinkering with early primates or that maybe we’re a lost colony of aliens, and for that matter the idea – called Panspermia – that original simple life might have originated in space and rained down on planets billions of years ago remains popular even with many scientists. 

**[00:37:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h37m08s)**  The problem with the lost colony notion is that we share a ridiculous amount of DNA with other animals and plants on Earth, so we’re obviously not direct descendants of there’s except in a near panspermia case, where they came to a desolate Earth a billion years ago and left behind some microbes which replaced life or started it and we descended from them. 

**[00:37:32](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h37m32s)**  The intentional tinkering with smart monkeys option is essentially the ancient alien astronaut option, category 3B, over again. 

**[00:37:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h37m41s)**  It’s possible but you have to wonder why, where’s the evidence, and where did they go. 

**[00:37:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h37m49s)**  As to panspermia itself, even if true, of which there’s no real evidence, one would have to say ‘so what?’. 

**[00:37:59](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h37m59s)**  If simple life hangs around space raining down on planets then life ought to be all over the place and constantly reseeding itself if a planet gets sterilized by supernova and gamma ray bursts. 

**[00:38:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h38m12s)**  It doesn’t change the Fermi Paradox except to maybe make it worse. 

**[00:38:17](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h38m17s)**  Like faster than light space ships, if true it only exacerbates the problem of where all the aliens are, not solve it. 

**[00:38:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h38m29s)**  So that’s category 3. 

**[00:38:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h38m30s)**  In category 1, alien civilizations are rare, we mostly encountered the recurring problem of there not being any good evidence to support any given Great Filter or series of Filters being so effective at preventing life from moving from basic self-replicating proteins up to interstellar technological civilizations. 

**[00:38:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h38m49s)**  In category 2 we kept tripping over the Mediocrity Principle and Non-Exclusivity of behavior. 

**[00:38:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h38m54s)**  Here in category 3 it was always a lack of evidence from the one place in the Universe we can actively gather evidence from. 

**[00:39:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h39m03s)**  Each had its strengths and weaknesses, and you probably have a favorite or ones you think are especially absurd and unlikely. 

**[00:39:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h39m13s)**  Before we finish this video though we’ll do some miscellaneous ones, some of which are pretty decent, and many of which are fairly absurd, at least in my view. 

**[00:39:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h39m26s)**  And if you’re wondering what my view is, or my bias, I haven’t personally locked on to any of these as my official stance but I favor Category 1B, that technological civilizations are just absurdly uncommon. 

**[00:39:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h39m39s)**  I don’t think technological civilization wipe themselves out much, because I consider that terribly pessimistic, I think to go from inanimate lifeless rocks to modern human civilization has a huge number of hurdles in the way and they really do add up to make technological civilizations so uncommon that even most galaxies have never had one yet, but I also figure there are probably a lot of worlds out there with life on them so I’m not a Rare Earth supporter. 

**[00:40:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h40m08s)**  So let’s do Category 4: 4A: Technological civilizations hit singularities: A technological singularity originally just meant an ever more rapidly increasing rate of technology till you hit a point where you had so much of it that your behavior was unpredictable. 

**[00:40:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h40m28s)**  This has tended to get used just as frequently these days for describing some truly super-intelligent computer mind a trillion times smarter than us. 

**[00:40:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h40m37s)**  By intelligence that’s basically godlike it is assumed its motives are unknowable. 

**[00:40:42](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h40m42s)**  Problem here, and I discuss this in the Dyson Dilemma video in more detail, even if this does occur we can still guess a couple motives. 

**[00:40:52](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h40m52s)**  It will want more energy and raw material to achieve faster processing and more memory storage and this should result in interstellar expansion too, even if it’s just remote resource mining being brought back to the original homeworld. 

**[00:41:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h41m09s)**  The other problem is non-exclusivity again. 

**[00:41:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h41m13s)**  We already have way more computer power than we need to do interstellar travel and while computer modeling plays a huge role in discovering new science and technology that would help us do that travel it probably isn’t absolutely necessary. 

**[00:41:27](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h41m27s)**  So non-exclusivity wins the day, we already know many of us consider Artificial intelligence or human all cyborged up and transhuman-ified a bit unnerving. 

**[00:41:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h41m38s)**  The Frankenstein complex its sometimes called. 

**[00:41:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h41m41s)**  And those fears are not dismissed as superstition by experts but rather considered very legitimate concerns. 

**[00:41:48](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h41m48s)**  Presumably some other species will be, by the mediocrity principle, more or less concerned then us and some might ban any computers that could run anything like a human level intelligence. 

**[00:42:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h42m00s)**  So beyond the fact that synthetic minds are not eliminating an intelligent species but just replacing them, there’s no reason to think this always happens and in such a way as to make them non-talkative or non-expansionist. 

**[00:42:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h42m18s)**  Again unless you subscribe to the notion of social progress to a single inevitable type of behavior. 

**[00:42:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h42m26s)**  4B: The Zoo Hypothesis or Quarantine: These are basically the same thing except the motives are different. 

**[00:42:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h42m35s)**  In the Zoo hypothesis Earth is, surprise, a giant zoo, they don’t talk to us so as not to interfere with our behavior and have wrapped some cloak of deception around the world so we don’t see them. 

**[00:42:46](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h42m46s)**  In Quarantine they view us as dangerous. 

**[00:42:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h42m49s)**  What’s wrong with these? 

**[00:42:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h42m53s)**  Well they are a lot like category 1C in that they have us perceiving a false reality where a group or individual with vastly more resources and intelligence is feeding us a line of bullshit. 

**[00:43:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h43m05s)**  We can’t prove it internally. 

**[00:43:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h43m07s)**  The other problems are, for the Zoo Hypothesis, we actually do interact with animals at the zoo, that’s the whole point of zoos originally. 

**[00:43:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h43m15s)**  Rare animals brought from faraway you can see up close. 

**[00:43:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h43m19s)**  Note that this is not necessarily benevolent behavior. 

**[00:43:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h43m22s)**  The other point is preservation of those rare animals and appreciating them, and we do interact with them and don’t consider it automatically harmful. 

**[00:43:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h43m31s)**  Humans don’t need preserving, we’re not rare. 

**[00:43:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h43m38s)**  For Quarantine, one might ask what thing, biological or psychological, they would be so afraid of us for that they would need to quarantine us, and why they couldn’t fix it, and why if they couldn’t fix it they would risk us continue to exist and develop more  and more technology. 

**[00:44:02](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h44m02s)**  This comes back to the problem I sometimes call the ‘Dumb Alien Theory’, where it assumes behavior by aliens which on examination is either absolutely stupid or beyond evil. 

**[00:44:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h44m14s)**  It is one thing to say ‘well they might be watching us till we reach a certain technology level, preventing us from outside harm by others’. 

**[00:44:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h44m22s)**  Sort of like the Star Trek Prime Directive. 

**[00:44:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h44m25s)**  Only problem is, if you’re on the receiving end of that Prime Directive, you have very good cause to be beyond angry at the people enforcing it. 

**[00:44:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h44m36s)**  Once the shock wears off you’re going to think of all the members of your species who died from resource scarcity, disease, old age, and other things the aliens could have fixed by just saying ‘hi, here’s some clean energy and all sorts of engineering and biological knowledge.’ And if they say ‘well, if you didn’t discover it on your own you would appreciate its dangers you could point out that you did not personally discover the atom bomb, nor in all likelihood did that particularly alien you’re talking to, and yet you are quite aware, as are they, that they are dangerous. 

**[00:45:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h45m15s)**  Space elves, or space hippies, who don’t want to talk to use because we abuse our environment would likely end up at the end accused of the worst hypocrisy since they obviously have figured out how to do so themselves and could have spared us, and our planet, a lot misery and extinction but giving us a hand. 

**[00:45:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h45m41s)**  4c: Interdiction This is like Zoo or Quarantine but a little more plausible. 

**[00:45:49](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h45m49s)**  In Interdiction various alien empires exist and enforce a no-contact policy with primitive worlds because xenocide is frowned on and they do not trust each other not to try to either exploit primitive civilizations or try to turn them to their side. 

**[00:46:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h46m05s)**  It’s fairly plausible to believe that emerging alien civilizations on bumping into each other setup treaties of how far each can expand that include leaving territory for other civilizations that will emerge and voluntary accept limits on their expansion in exchange for that same limit on everyone else. 

**[00:46:26](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h46m26s)**  There’s a lot of parallels in human history for that sort of behavior. 

**[00:46:38](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h46m38s)**  In such a case its plausible that emerging civilizations are interdicted from contact for those reasons but while this is a bit better than zoo or quarantine solutions it still suffers from all the other problems in sub-category 2D, the one where aliens are afraid to talk. 

**[00:46:58](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h46m58s)**  4d: Self-imposed Quarantine: This is the notion that they don’t quarantine us, or even really hide from each other, but all agree to stay on their homeworlds or not expand much out, because they’ve come to realize they have massive destructive potential and almost any interaction with any alien could spark wars. 

**[00:47:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h47m22s)**  This suffers from a lot of the same problems as our similar cases but its big flaw is in it’s strength. 

**[00:47:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h47m29s)**  This theory assumes that aliens definitely do not socially progress towards an inevitable behavior system, that they do things that absolutely disgust each other enough to spark wars when in proximity, and yet by giving that nod to non-exclusivity it also requires they all still engage in an exclusive behavior… of staying the hell away from each other, rather than, say, some of them being enthusiastic about genocide. 

**[00:48:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h48m00s)**  It also requires the notion of irreconcilable differences between aliens but ones not bad enough to initiate crusades to wipe an alien civilization out. 

**[00:48:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h48m19s)**  Just as an example though, it is entirely possible you might encounter a peaceful and benevolent species which had a high breeding rate and routinely killed 90% of their young off, the equivalent of butchering everyone in fifth grade who didn’t make the honor roll, and them being just as disgusted by use because we actually allow kids who show any signs of self-destructive behavior or psychopathy to live even though we have doomsday weapons they could conceivably get their hands on. 

**[00:48:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h48m57s)**  In such a situation, even though neither species wants war, they know that clashes or war might easily happen if they have to interact much rather than ignore each other from afar. 

**[00:49:13](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h49m13s)**  4e: Intelligent Life got wiped out relatively recently, replacements have genuinely not had time to expand much. 

**[00:49:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h49m23s)**  This is popular solution in fiction but its big flaw, besides no evidence, is that it really couldn’t be limited to just this galaxy. 

**[00:49:34](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h49m34s)**  The Universe does not end at the edge of the Milky Way and even if some natural or artificial catastrophe had occurred to recently for other galaxies to see it and move in on the fresh territory, we ought to be able to see them too, especially if they are engaging in multi-system Dyson Swarm construction. 

**[00:49:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h49m57s)**  One would also have to ask what natural phenomena just killed intelligent life or why someone would go around killing intelligent life and not bother leaving mechanisms in place to continue that process after the purge and why they even let it get to a technological level if they are continuing the purge. 

**[00:50:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h50m18s)**  Why not, as we mentioned earlier, leave telescopes on every system staring at planets looking for any patterns emerging like roads or canals or pyramids etc. 

**[00:50:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h50m28s)**  4f: Rim Migration It’s been suggested that if most civilizations eventually go totally digital, then in order to deal with all their waste heat they’d migrate away from the inner galaxy to the rim where it’s colder. 

**[00:50:43](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h50m43s)**  This would usually imply they built a huge supercomputer around their sun and moved that whole star system out to the edge of the galaxy… this doesn’t even require much technology, all Dyson Spheres are capable of being modified into interstellar vehicles by definition, this is called a Shkadov thruster and we discussed this in the Dyson Dilemma video. 

**[00:51:03](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h51m03s)**  You just let some light out one side and it pushes you in the other direction. 

**[00:51:08](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h51m08s)**  Now this isn’t even vaguely covert, you don’t hide a Shkadov thruster form the inhabitants of the galaxy it is leaving because it’s about as realistic to hide that as to hide an ICBM launch from the farmer living next to the silo, and since it takes a very long time, hiding daily launches for millions of years. 

**[00:51:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h51m29s)**  But to be fair, we could easily have missed that, with our current level of detection ability, but if this was a regular thing it is one of the types we’d be able to see in the not too distant future. 

**[00:51:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h51m41s)**  This also has the expansion problem, unless they’re only doing it to their home system meaning they don’t colnize other stars then we ought to see millions of stars constantly heading out of the galaxy and we wouldn’t miss that here and we’d see it even in other galaxies which we actually considered a realistic possibility for Ring galaxies like Hoag’s Object for a while. 

**[00:52:09](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h52m09s)**  4g: “They’ve ascended” A popular idea in science fiction, and not too dissimilar to technological singularity models, is the idea that intelligent life eventually goes post-physical becoming beings of pure energy or taking off for higher planes of existence. 

**[00:52:31](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h52m31s)**  There’s really not much to say about this, it works just fine as a solution to the Fermi Paradox especially if you get there before you go interstellar, but there’s no scientific basis for it and to me at least it sounds like options from category 1C, or basically it’s a bit heavy on the mysticism for my tastes. 

**[00:52:53](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h52m53s)**  I told myself I wouldn’t go through this video mocking any of the ideas so I’m not going to say that it’s basically new age crap for people who didn’t like any of the legion of perfectly serviceable religions already around and went in for one produced by a sci-fi author instead. 

**[00:53:14](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h53m14s)**  Of course that’s absurd since no one would ever convert to a religion some author just cobbled together one day. 

**[00:53:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h53m21s)**  4h: We haven’t picked a long distance carrier yet This one was funnier back when people had long distance carriers for their phones and we had long distance phone calls but it also goes by ‘we need to put a deposit down to get the signal unscrambled’. 

**[00:53:44](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h53m44s)**  Really just a variant of 2A, they have mouths but we’ve got no ears, except that by embracing the idea that we’re not getting reception because we haven’t picked a carrier or paid to get the signal unscrambled it gets the stamp of ‘Dumb Aliens’ from me because if you’re selling a product you have to be an utter moron not to advertise it. 

**[00:54:06](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h54m06s)**  Though it matches up decently with the Interdiction or Self-Imposed Quarantine solutions, it’s out there, you can get it, but they don’t advertise because they’re not allowed or think it’s bad manners. 

**[00:54:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h54m18s)**  Still has all the other problems associated to Non-exclusivity or mediocrity principle though. 

**[00:54:24](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h54m24s)**  4i: Made out of meat. 

**[00:54:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h54m28s)**  If you’re a big Fermi Paradox follower you’re probably wondering when I was going to mention Terry Bisson’s short story “They’re made out of meat” since I’ve just mentioned a lot of the other popular ‘weird ones’, and the answer was nearly no, that was covered in category 3C, aliens are unrecognizable, and I always considered that a very stupid one anyway. 

**[00:54:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h54m50s)**  The notion that aliens couldn’t recognize humans as intelligent because we’re made out of meat trips right on the starting line by assuming they obviously know what the hell meat is, a material used to allow animals to move that implicitly requires a functioning nervous system. 

**[00:55:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h55m10s)**  If they didn’t know what meat was they wouldn’t call it meat, they’d call it bundles of proteins and be shocked things used it for locomotion. 

**[00:55:21](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h55m21s)**  It’s also implied they’ve encountered plenty of other aliens before and you really would expect locomotion to be a common trait of intelligent life and doing it by causing contractions via electrical stimulus to be one of the more normal routes. 

**[00:55:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h55m37s)**  I saved this one for last because while I get that any attempt to impress an audience with the sheer alien-ness of a given alien can fall flat on deep examination I really have no idea why this one seems to make so many Fermi Paradox solution lists. 

**[00:55:54](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h55m54s)**  And yeah, we’re done, I’m sure I missed a few in their but if you’re newer to the Fermi Paradox that covers most of the bases. 

**[00:56:05](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h56m05s)**  The companion video, the Dyson Dilemma, is also worth watching if you’ve made it this far with being bored to death. 

**[00:56:12](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Z4snQS1QGD4&t=00h56m12s)**  I hope you enjoyed this and thanks for watching!
