Leo Tolstoy said “The two most powerful warriors are patience and time”. 

When it comes to interstellar warfare, he couldn’t know how right he was. 

So today we will be looking at interstellar warfare and the dynamics involved between how two ships would fight while traveling in interstellar space, how you’d move fleets around, and the sorts of weapons people might shoot from their home system to an enemy star system, the interstellar equivalent of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, ISBMs rather than ICBMs. 

This won’t be one of our longer episodes but you might still want to grab a drink and snack, because there’s also a companion episode talking more about the science fiction and worldbuilding aspects of interstellar warfare which I’ll mention again near the end. 

This episode itself is focused more on the known science angles and how it affects the concept of Interstellar conflicts. 

That’s a tricky concept too. 

As I mentioned back in the original Space Warfare episode, predicting the future of the battlefield in terms of tactics and strategies is almost an exercise in futility because the dynamics of combat can change massively with a single minor piece of new technology. 

I’ve seen that first hand too, my own unit got in a ton of new gear prior to our deployment to Iraq, a lot of lasers and optics, so unsurprisingly my unit’s leadership decided the guy who’d been working on a doctorate in physics before jumping ship to enlist was well-suited to figure out how all the new toys worked and train the others with them. 

New gadgets, no matter how good, are useless if folks don’t know how and when to use them, indeed they can do more harm than good, but of course used properly even a seemingly minor bit of technology can let you dominate a battlefield. 

That’s the first rule of warfare too, know how to use your equipment. 

Anyway I wanted to be upfront about that for today, that we are playing a very big guessing game. 

To add to that my own background is in artillery and infantry combat too, not ships, but then modern sea-going navy ships will likely have far less in common with spaceship warfare than sci-fi tends to portray. 

Or short form, I don’t really know what I’m talking about here but odds are nobody else does either. 

All we can do is look at basic physics and military history and try to see what does and doesn’t make sense. 

And of course the short answer is pretty much nothing we ever see in sci-fi makes sense, though with some weird exceptions. 

For instance one of the classic complaints against a lot of old shows is how both ships would just park and shoot at each other at short range. 

That image is mostly incorrect, though forgivable since spaceship engagement ranges are so big you could never see the ships fighting if portrayed realistically. 

However the parking part is partially accurate. 

Two ships approaching each other at interstellar speeds will only get one short pass with an engagement window that might be as short as milliseconds. 

They can’t loop around for another pass even if they have the fuel as at 1G of acceleration or deceleration, they’ll need a week for every percent of light speed they were traveling, to slow down and speed back up in the opposite direction. 

However the opposite case, a stern chase where one ship is slowly catching up on another, would actually seem like a stationary battle, especially out in deep space where nothing seems to be moving. 

Even at decently relativistic speeds the stars don’t go zipping past like in Star Trek, so you’d still need pretty precise equipment to even measure a shift to them over one day. 

In that case too we have to remember this is space, not sea or ground. 

Ships can flip over and even move around side to side or up and down while still carrying that forward inertia, so that to the two vessels involved in the chase it will just seem like both are mostly parked or just moving around to maneuver. 

But it is the range of things, even over and beyond what we saw in interplanetary warfare, that makes interstellar combat different. 

Let’s go back to that head-on attack example. 

Two ships moving toward each other at, say, 15% of light speed from their home systems, we’ll say Earth and Epsilon Eridani, about 10 light years apart. 

Either of them would take 70 years to cover that distance, but 35 years into things they’d run into each other halfway between with a combined speed of 30% of light. 

The distance between them is going to shrink by 100,000 kilometers a second. 

Now most modern ships and fighter jets weapons have an engagement range of less than 100 kilometers, especially for anything not guided, so if that was their window to shoot at each other they’d have exactly 2 milliseconds to shoot as they enter that window then exit on the other side. 

That’s about 1% of the time a typical human reaction takes place during, and a millisecond is so short it is below the human threshold to recognize. 

Add to that if the two survive that first pass, with human crews, and want to make another, they both need to slam on the break at 1 gee, and if they do, 15 weeks later they can re-engage for a second pass, which is a lot longer than the 15 or so seconds that it tends to take in a sci-fi space duel. 

Obviously, a human can’t handle much more than a G of acceleration for prolonged periods, and a human can’t handle millisecond engagements, but a computer can be built to do both. 

There are realistic limits on how much G-force any complex machine can handle, and it will depend on the weakest link in the ship, but even 10,000 Gs might be plausible. 

Suddenly a second pass doesn’t require 15 weeks, it requires 15 minutes, a ten-thousandth the time. 

Incidentally there’s just over 10,000 minutes in a week. 

Having said that, the amount of power required to generate a 10,000 G turn in a ship of any significant mass will be staggeringly impressive. 

And again, that would seem to be obvious, what a lot of folks say, that manned spaceships make no sense, and that we only even see it in fiction because stories not centered on humans are boring to many people to read or watch or play, so we stick crews on ships and pilots in fighter craft to give them a human face. 

But that’s something we’ll be challenging a bit today too, at least for a larger vessel acting more like a carrier. 

Fighters, at least the classic single pilot variety manned by a regular human, are not realistically viable. 

There are a few things we can say with near certain confidence about interstellar warfare. 

Direct engagements will be terribly fast and likely lethal to at least one if not both parties, overall battles and wars will be terribly slow, and the energies involved will be terribly massive. 

Nobody aims for pyrrhic victories so those close direct engagements are likely to almost always involve at least one of the combatants only using expendable drones and munitions, while their major assets stay far further back and try attacks and maneuvers that are far less likely to succeed, but also far less likely to get them killed in the process. 

That’s the first rule of warfare after all, try not lose while winning, Pyrrhic Victories aren’t. 

Such direct engagements at speed also leave you no room to follow up if it doesn’t go according to plan, all assuming you even survived it. 

Just as an example, if we assumed some 100 kiloton space vessel from the examples we just looked at, something of a mass and size parallel to a modern aircraft carrier, and remembering that energy goes up with the square of speed, then that ship was carrying about 10^23 Joules of energy, about the amount of energy in all the sunlight hitting the whole planet of Earth over a weeks time. 

So the human crewed one needing 15 weeks to slow down will be turning on an engine at least powerful enough to light a whole continent while it slows down. 

Or alternatively, the energy release of shooting out several megaton-yield atomic bombs every second. 

This goes with something I’ve said before in other episodes, that there is no such thing as an unarmed spaceship, and this is certainly true of an interstellar one. 

When you think of a classic sci-fi manned starship unleashing an orbital bombardment, don’t think of it leveling a city, think more like it was using a machine gun on a planet with H-bombs as the bullets, and probably more realistically, it likely has several of those it regards as secondary weapons. 

This is something sci-fi author Larry Niven dubbed “The Kzinti Lesson”, for a militant alien race called the Kzin in his Known Space series, or rather the lesson they learned, that “a reaction drive's efficiency as a weapon is in direct proportion to its efficiency as a drive.”, which can be re-stated in a more generalized and simplified form as “Whatever energy a ship has to move itself around represents the minimum destructive power it has available to it”. 

Meaning, if that ship in our example rammed Earth, it would hit with a force comparable to the asteroid that is assumed to have ended the dinosaurs, which had thousands of times the total explosive yield of every warhead in existence during the height of the Cold War. 

Now alternatively, the 10,000 G robot ship will be turning on an engine 10,000 times as powerful, able to light up thousands of planets simultaneously, releasing as much energy every second as our whole planetary economy uses in a year. 

That’s an important thing to consider too, because if you’re assuming folks have these kinds of energies to give a single ship, then try imagining what their actual economy and population look like. 

On those rare occasions science fiction remembers the kind of kinetic energy a spaceship has in terms of planetary destruction, it tends to forget the kind of fortifications a planet could build if it had access to a power source able to run one of those engines. 

This would not be dozens of defense satellites each carrying a big particle beam and dozens of atomic warheads, but potentially millions of titanic defense installations each able to obliterate virtually anything we’d normally think of as a spaceship in fiction. 

We’ve talked about deploying entire stars as weapon systems before, the Nicoll-Dyson Beam episode covers that, both the idea of a mega-laser able to turn the full fury of a whole star on a distant system and the alternative, of having it use that beam to shove missiles with guidance systems up to relativistic velocities able to arrive as volleys. 

This is the preferred approach usually as you can use the solar output for many months or even years to push missiles launched separately, all at slightly different speeds timed to arrive simultaneously. 

These devices, generally known as a RKV or RKM, Relativistic Kill Vehicle or Relativistic Kinetic Missile or a few other names, essentially the interstellar version of the ICBM, and can include fairly elaborate guidance a laser can’t have. 

What’s more, as you get closer to light speed the kinetic energy no longer rises with the square of velocity, but even more sharply, so they carry an unbelievable punch. 

Also, while there is no stealth in space, a RKM is very hard to see and moving so fast that even when you see it you have little time to react, as the light from it is only reaching you just ahead of the missile. 

You either detect it during launch or have to detect it by the slight glow of collision radiation with the interstellar medium, which will brighten as it goes faster. 

The faster something is moving, the less time you have to react to it and the more energy it has to do damage, but you can also see it further out and it’s even more vulnerable to destruction by some small object just waiting in standby to flick into its path. 

They can also be manned since they aren’t necessarily accelerating very fast. 

That seems pretty dark, the notion of a manned missile, but suicide missions are hardly uncommon in war and finding volunteers generally isn’t as hard as one might wish it was. 

Add to that, high-tech civilizations, even if they regard AI as just as human as a human, can presumably find volunteers even more easily, since they can offer to backup or copy the mind of the individual involved. 

That also has some disturbing implications that get explored in our book of the month, Richard K. Morgan’s “Altered Carbon”, that we’ll discuss more in our episode on Teleportation in two weeks. 

Using the example of the energy in the dinosaur-killing asteroid that hit the Yucatan Peninsula 65 million years ago, it’s worth noting that the Sun releases that much energy every millisecond, so a Kardashev-2 Civilization with full access to their Sun’s total energy could be launching such a RKM a thousand times per second and would have no problem hurling literally a billion of them to hit a neighboring system simultaneously. 

That’s just two weeks of solar output. 

A billion missiles each massing around a thousand tons, all shoved up to 99% of light speed by giant lasers. 

All presumably with an advanced guidance system capable of splitting the missile up into thousands if not millions of sub-munitions, enough to strike every single square meter of a planet with the explosive output of an artillery shell. 

And again, that’s just one of them, they can hurl a billion. 

This is assuming no new technology either, such a weapon requires huge energy but is very simplistic. 

And these are thus the minimum kinds of attack you need to prepare against. 

Not a single enemy mothership, not even a decently sized-armada of maybe hundreds of ships, but the full and virtually incomprehensible might of a civilization using a whole star to fuel their war machine. 

Folks often ask me why you’d make a Dyson Swarm, since its seems a ridiculous amount of energy and people, but while I think you would fill such a thing up with people eventually, I suspect tapping all that energy would be a high priority even when you were barely at the population needed to fill a planet. 

Such energy can be stored too, possibly in kugelblitz black holes, possibly as manufactured anti-matter and, even using a steampunk technology, as trillions of tiny flywheels spun up with that energy just spinning around in space waiting for use, after all the problem with flywheels as power storage is that air and friction spin them down, which is obviously not a problem in space. 

We’ll be talking about various energy storage options later this spring in Portable Power, but the key thing is that you can store energy in huge quantities to use. 

You also, in a high-tech civilization, probably have virtually unlimited effective manpower, since you can not only have robots do most of the work but tell them to build more of each other instead, then build whatever you need. 

So when trying to consider K2 or near K2 civilizations, the only kind likely to have most of the normal motivations for war, like resource shortages or border disputes, at the interstellar scale, don’t just picture vast amounts of rotating habitats or computers or solar power collectors, think massive factories, many potentially just sitting there doing self-maintenance on an army of robots, and huge energy storage depositories ready to feed those into defense or production. 

You also probably aren’t arriving to attack such a system after years of uninterrupted flight for a final day of encountering resistance. 

Such civilizations probably have their whole outer solar system, even deep into the Oort Cloud, loaded with defense installations hunting for attacks, signs of attack, and potentially ready to respond or retaliate. 

You also don’t want an enemy using the material in your own outer solar system to establish a beachhead. 

Your weapons hardly have to be sheer power either. 

Odds are good interstellar civilizations are effectively immune to biological and chemical attacks. 

It’s just that the nature of space habitats would make infecting or gassing one very tricky, but even without considering weapons relying on new technology, we have that army of robots issue. 

If they can build themselves, then they can build ones that can build more and so on. 

A single tiny bot covertly deployed somewhere could fairly rapidly build up quite an army, one that grows stronger with each victory. 

Fighting self-replicating machines in space is a lot like fighting a necromancer, you don’t ever want to engage unless you can win, because your lost troops stand right back up again and join in the attack. 

Now of course, the first rule of warfare is to not fight battles you’ll lose, but a common caveat to that would be that it’s the war you don’t want to lose, so throwing in on battles where you might lose, or even are sure you will but will delay or distract the enemy, are often okay. 

Again not so in this sort of case. 

You’re just feeding them. 

However they do need a constant supply of energy to manufacture and replicate, so it’s a good idea to have all of those resources bottled up and defended. 

Energy not only provides a potential bottleneck but a means of easy detection. 

As I mentioned back in Space Warfare, there is no stealth in space, but you can get a lot closer before being seen so long as you aren’t doing things that require power, once you start using power you will light up like a beacon signal. 

And these same civilizations who can build billions of relativistic missiles can build billions of telescopes and detection devices, so don’t expect to sneak up on them. 

Now a rebuttal to that would be that this sort of thing only applies to K2 civilizations or those decently near that, but that’s pretty much the only kind who will be fighting interstellar wars. 

Or at least one of the two or more involved parties will be. 

You have to consider the motives to get into such a thing in the first place. 

Obviously you need none but survival to be attacked, but someone has to do the attacking. 

So what were their motives? 

Were they low on space or resources in their home system? 

If so that can only be because they chewed through them or see themselves doing so in the reasonably near future, which means they are a K2 civilization, probably bigger since it’s unlikely they have neighbors to fight who aren’t their own colonies. 

Perhaps they want to exterminate all other life? 

If so they must be pretty passionate about it to plan out multi-century or millennia purges across huge volumes of galactic space. 

Presumably more than enough to decide to grow their numbers and resources into a K2, but they don’t actually need to grow their own numbers either, just tell their robots to grow their numbers. 

Nothing says a K2 civilization needs to contain a billion, billion people, just that it has the energy and infrastructure able to do so if that was their intent. 

Maybe they just love war, like the Klingons? 

Okay, if you love it, you probably make it a focus for your civilization, meaning you probably always want more soldiers and ships, which means you want more people and factories, which means you become a K2. 

Or maybe they’re not aggressive but just want to be safe against attack… in which case they become a K2. 

Any interstellar conflict, particularly if you are limited to light speed or slower, is only happening if at least one of the parties involved is very passionate about it and in a sustained way. 

They won’t be folks prone to half-measures or easily bored and we have to contemplate that as part of their motives and behavior in a potential conflict. 

Fundamentally high-tech civilizations are unlikely to be composed of wimps or idiots, they’re unlikely to have ever gotten any technology if they were either after all, and again they don’t have to be numerically expansionist. 

They could, if they like, just stay living mostly on the homeworld but have a bunch of self-replicating robots stowed away in various asteroids ready to exploit those raw materials in an emergency, and a fair amount of solar collectors and raw materials to build more, with more robots near those, all just patiently waiting for some deep space detector to send the signal of an incoming attack and go into a flurry of self-replication and manufacture. 

They’ve got millions of detectors seeded out in the depths of their Oort cloud ready to give advance notice to turn those factories on and pump out whole planets worth of defensive gear. 

An armada approaching an undefended system, detected early, might find that by the time they arrive in system those robots have converted whole moons into defensive stations and ships. 

Of course if you’ve got a swarm of a billion, thousand-ton RKVS heading in at 98% of light speed, your signal is only going to arrive a week in advance of them for every light year out you detected them at. 

So it pays to have a lot of defenses ready. 

You might ask how the heck you deal with a billion, thousand ton RKVs, each smart and guided, each able to hit with extinction-level force. 

And the answer is with a billion one kilogram balls able to smack into one, at those kinds of speeds they’d be obliterated. 

This presumably leads to countermeasures and counter-countermeasures with various point defense systems on the RKVs trying to nail such devices with anti-collision lasers or even smaller anti-anti-RKV devices, but one advantage the attacker has is that they can do a lot of damage just by the sheer amount of relativistic shrapnel and secondary debris left over from their missiles. 

The sooner out you can intercept that, the wider the cone that debris will cover and the more time you have to try to clean up that nebula-like wave of deadly space trash headed your way. 

We discussed the basic concept last week in Orbital Infrastructure, in regard to Kessler Syndrome around Earth, and how a scaled up version is a massive threat to a Kardashev 2 civilization. 

And like Kessler Syndrome, this doesn’t require an intentional attack, one interstellar spaceship cruising in a system and exploding from some engine fault could shotgun a solar system. 

Such threats are manageable but only if you’ve got the infrastructure lying around to handle it. 

Now all these concerns only apply if there is some parity in size and technology, which in general won’t be the case if it’s say, Earth and one of its new colonies, or rather the Solar System versus one, not the entirety of some interstellar empire due to the huge lag times required just to decided to attack and how. 

So it’s probably more likely to be colony-on-colony conflicts, potentially just two factions in two seperate systems, neither of whom is the only nation in that system. 

In either case rules might apply, so as to avoid drawing in neighbors who might take sides or intervene. 

Or two technologically maxed out civilizations who originated thousands of light years away from each other and the defender gains an advantage as they get pushed back towards their more built up core systems and have more time, relatively speaking, to figure out the enemy’s technology and build defenses, while the attacker is increasingly slowed by time lag for new tech, reinforcements, and general coordination from their own home systems. 

Such interstellar empire on empire wars must take thousands of years both from the space involved and the need to bring along or build your infrastructure in newly conquered systems to progress to attack the next. 

In-system conflicts we covered in Interplanetary warfare and one-sided curbstomp battles we discussed in the Alien Civilizations series, which takes considerably longer to watch than such conflicts would tend to last. 

If an Armada from a K2 civilization shows up in Earth orbit tomorrow looking to tussle, we’re going to lose, and very quickly, unless they’ve got some weird sense of honor where they refuse to land more forces than we have. 

In which case we’d probably still lose, because they’re probably all genetically or cybernetically enhanced death machines. 

I wouldn’t like our odds even if they just landed one ship with a single dude that walked out naked with a sharp stick. 

That’s a thing to remember and which we’ll explore more in the Planetary Invasion episode, an enemy invading some planet or space habitat might have marines composed of genetically or cybernetically enhanced super-soldiers who don’t fear death because their minds are backed up somewhere. 

However, those civilian targets, composed of normally peaceful inhabitants, might also be cyborg’d up transhumans suddenly pumped up with rapidly manufactured weapons and combat software, all with their minds backed up somewhere else too so they are less worried about death. 

That same paradigm applies to big classic manned ships too. 

You have that acceleration issue and reaction time issue, but you could use transhumans instead of AI, and moreover you shouldn’t be engaging at hundred of kilometers but more likely at hundreds of millions of kilometers or further. 

And you probably aren’t engaging with one ship or hundreds of ships but possible hundreds of thousands of ships. 

You potentially have large capital ships too, each of which might have thousands or millions of little drones they deploy for the equivalent of fighter attacks and defense screens. 

Back on those capital ships though, standing off a potentially many millions or even billions of kilometers, in order to be able to dodge incoming directed energy fire moving at light speed, the real concern on maneuvering is fuel, far more than how fast they can maneuver is how much total delta-v they have for that. 

The further off you are the less delta-v you need to apply to make sure your ship isn’t where an enemy beam was aimed. 

We discussed the details of that back in space warfare, but in short form it makes classically manned and large ships more plausible again because their constraint is still more about ensuring fuel conservation than how fast they can burn it. 

That said, the more G-force that ship can handle, either accelerating or turning, the closer it can be and dodge laser or particle beam fire as it randomly jinks around. 

Of course that’s assuming your ship is solid, it could be composed of lots of smaller bits acting more like cells or a liquid. 

At the end of the day, an AI or cyborg run ship is still the better option but the disadvantage is no longer as huge for a manned capital ship essentially acting as a carrier and command and control for a swarm of drones. 

Most likely you use lots of ships, big fleets, engaging over huge distances, slowly coordinating and maneuvering and inflicting some damage until one side realizes it’s odds of victory have dropped and peels off to retreat, rather than decisive engagements where both sides take huge casualties. 

In cases like that you wouldn’t really have Ships of the Line, our classic term for a line of capital ships engaging another fleet, but more like Ships of the Wall, a 2D screen, something David Weber uses in his Honorverse series, probably one of the best military sci-fi series for discussing sublight battles and how those might occur, though he’s got FTL in there and a type of shields. 

Any given fiction setting with made up technology is going to need an entirely different approach to realistic combat and sadly most don’t think a lot of it through. 

Understandably so, we’ve barely touched on the topic today and even then only in the context of known science, we aren’t including options like opening a wormhole right on top of your enemy’s planet, not to dump soldiers through but to dump the other end in a sun or black hole. 

Thinking through what a given hypothetical technology can do is a big aspect of sci-fi worldbuilding and we’ll talk about it in the companion video. 

It’s pretty challenging too, and fun. 

I mentioned back in the Interstellar Empires episode a few months back that one of my side projects to the channel was working on developing the tech and lore for an upcoming video game, Hades 9, and basically to help forge the setting, and said I’d discuss it more down the road. 

It’s also where a lot of graphics for this episode and some others have come from. 

That’s been progressing and I suggested we do a walk up to release by setting up a channel and doing some short videos about not just gameplay but the setting, its story, and the making of the game. 

They liked the idea and we decided to roll a few out to start and add as we go, and they talked me into doing one of them. 

Not that it was a very hard sell and I suppose it’s really more ‘we’ these days, but we’ll look there more at the concept of realistic worldbuilding, especially in the far future, not so much keeping to known science but making those necessary departures from science minimal and plausible and mesh well together without obvious loopholes. 

That’s what I aimed to achieve with Hades 9’s tech and backstory, set 4000 years in the future. 

As I said, that’s for the companion episode and I’ll leave a link to it in the video description, on an in-video card, and in the end screen with the credits. 

Next week we’ll be going even further ahead in time, not four thousand years but 4 billion years and further, back to the Civilizations at the End of Time series for Dying Earth. 

The week after that we’ll discuss the concept of Teleportation and see what options there might be for that under known science. 

We’ll then close out March with a look at Advanced Metamaterials and some of the potentially world-changing applications they have.

Outward Bound: Colonizing Alpha Centauri
---
  
2018-02-22  
https://youtu.be/JkeLIAd2Nd0

The sunrise is one of the most beautiful parts of our day. 

One of the cool things about Alpha Centauri is you get to watch the sun rise three times a day. 

So today we are back to the Outward Bound Series, to look at Colonizing Alpha Centauri. 

Our interest today deals with binary stars or multiple star systems and how these will influence our ability to colonize them. 

As we will see today, Alpha Centauri has some special complications to it which might actually make Alpha Centauri not the first one we’d want to colonize. 

We’ll get to those problems in a bit. 

This episode is longer than usual so you might like to get yourself a drink and a snack before we begin. 

Let us make things more interesting today and as a thought experiment make it imperative that we colonize Alpha Centauri within the near future. 

Let us say that we detect a rogue stellar mass black hole about 10 times as massive as our Sun heading towards our Solar system that will not just graze past us, which would be bad enough, perturbing orbits, possibly ejecting planets, and ensuring constant hails of comets and asteroids, but is going slow enough it will actually settle into a binary orbit with our own Sun, and drag it out of this area of the galaxy in the process. 

It may even start eating it. 

The only silver lining is that it is going slow enough that we can contemplate an evacuation over the next couple centuries. 

Despite the problems with Alpha Centauri, we decide to colonize it. 

The main reasons for this are that there is not just one but three stars in that system. 

Humanity has learned the hard way not to put all of its eggs in a single basket, and in the Alpha Centauri system we have 3 star baskets for our precious humanity. 

Another reason is that the system is the closest to Earth, being an average of 4.37 light years away. 

When the date arrives to pack up all of humanity and move them in bulk, the most economical way is going to be a combination of stellasers and the interstellar laser highway system we’ve previously discussed. 

Normally you’d have to build one for each system, but another advantage of going to Alpha Centauri is you could service all three stars with just one, and shorter is better for such a highway. 

If multiple colonies are established around those stars, even the furthest ones will be able to receive radio messages transmitted from each other within two months. 

Now two months sounds like a long time, but empires did very well here on Earth with year-long communication delays back when the only way to get around the world was by sailing ships. 

We know it is doable, so we can keep the colonies relatively cohesive for at least a time. 

We also know we can evacuate Earth and I recommend watching our recent episode on that. 

We decide to evacuate and send out colony ships, an initial vanguard to set things up and a vastly larger armada to follow in several waves later. 

As is the case throughout the series, it’s not the journey that interests us or the spaceships that get us there. 

We’ve looked at those before in the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium and the Interstellar Travel Challenges episode. 

We also looked at what life on an interstellar ark ship would be like in the Life in a Space Colony series, episode 2, Life on a Colony Ship. 

However, as I said earlier, our preferred mode of transport to get there is a combination of stellasers and the interstellar laser highway. 

Now Alpha Centauri is a star system, not a star. 

Alpha Centauri consists of two large stars, one a bit brighter and one a bit dimmer than our own, which orbit each other every 80 years and get as close to each other as Saturn and the Sun do and as far apart as Pluto and the Sun. 

The larger is Alpha Centauri A, the smaller, Alpha Centauri B. However there is also a third star, Alpha Centauri C, more commonly known as Proxima Centauri, which is actually the closest star to Earth. 

Each planet orbits its closest star in that system, not all of the stars at once. 

There is a debate whether Proxima Centauri is a visitor to the Alpha Centauri system or a permanent member. 

If it is a permanent member, it is right on the extreme edge of being part of the Alpha Centauri system. 

If we use the analogy of the A and B stars as being a city centre, Proxima is at the very outer edges of the rural outer suburbs, almost completely independent from A and B at a fifth of a light year away from them and only very weakly gravitationally bound to the system. 

At 13,000 AU distance from the other stars, Proxima orbits the A and B system only about twice every million years. 

Now, while Proxima Centauri is the closest star to us, we can’t see it with the naked eye. 

Alpha Centauri A is just 10% more massive than our own Sun, but 50% brighter, and B is 10% less massive than our Sun and half as bright, a third the brightness of its partner. 

Proxima, on the other hand, is only about an eighth of the Sun’s mass and 600 times dimmer than our Sun. 

After an epic 4.24 light-years journey, our colony ships arrive in the Alpha Centauri system at its closest star, Proxima Centauri. 

The star is a red dwarf. 

Its habitable zone or Goldilocks zone, where water can exist in liquid form, is much closer to the star than our Sun’s. 

We already knew it has a planet in its habitable zone, called Proxima b, something we confirmed by sending probes out ahead of the colony ships. 

We suspected that the planet was rocky and one would like to think that it would be likely we could find life there or at least make that planet habitable for us. 

To our relief, the probes show that the earlier remote observations from Earth were correct and Proxima b is indeed a rocky planet with 1.3 times Earth gravity. 

Also in its favor, Proxima Centauri will survive much longer than Alpha Centauri A or B or even our Sun. 

Its expected lifespan in its main sequence is four trillion years, about 300 times the current age of the Universe. 

Being so weakly gravitationally bound to A and B, it is also likely that it will leave that system some time in the future and well before A or B go nova at the end of their lives. 

For humans at Proxima, from a system longevity standpoint, we are trading up in a big way! 

So far, so good; this is a place we want to settle. 

However, we have to come to terms with several big issues. 

Firstly, Proxima b is only 0.05 AU (7.5 million km) from its star. 

To put that in perspective, it is 8 times closer to Proxima Centauri than Mercury is to our Sun. 

While that is a perfect distance to get temperatures that allow liquid water to exist from the much reduced light from Proxima Centauri, the problem is that Proxima Centauri is a variable star. 

That means convection in the star’s body creates magnetic fields that result in random and frequent flaring, generating not only very bright outbursts but also a total X-ray emission similar to that produced by our Sun, even though Proxima Centauri is much smaller and dimmer On Proxima b, this will cause massive random increases in deadly X-ray radiation as well as UV, visible and infrared light. 

To give you an idea of the scope of the problem, in August 2015 the largest recorded flares of the star were recorded, with the star becoming 8.3 times brighter than normal. 

Imagine standing outside on Earth on a warm sunny Summer’s day when the Sun suddenly gets 8 times brighter and hotter and you start to understand the problem. 

That amount of radiation is more than enough to fry and sterilize a fledgling colony that close-in to the star. 

Another problem is that Proxima b was expected to be tidally locked to Proxima Centauri, meaning the same face always points at the star. 

Yeah, our probes confirm this too - there is no day, night cycle. 

We have long suspected that red dwarf planets in the habitable zone will lack atmospheres. 

The solar wind is expected to be more than a thousand times that of our own sun, which should be more than enough to blast the atmosphere off any rocky planet that strays too close. 

In Proxima b’s case, this is made worse by the star’s regular flaring too, which causes even more solar wind in short bursts. 

Our probes confirm our suspicions, Proxima b has little to no atmosphere. 

The spectrum of the red dwarf also means that it puts out more infrared radiation for the same amount of visible light as on Earth, even when it is not flaring. 

This means that if we want the same amount of visible light as on Earth, we are going to be receiving much more heat. 

Alternatively, if we want the temperature to be cooler, we have to put up with less visible light. 

We have regularly taken on the persona of a character we call our traveller at various times in our Outward Bound series. 

This episode is a thought experiment and therefore, not strictly canon, but we’ll re-introduce our traveller here too to get a human perspective on all this. 

This time, he is a senior engineering crew member on the colonizing ships. 

We huddle around and ask how we can colonize the system without getting fried, irradiated or living in perpetual light or darkness or even twilight? 

Now we’ve discussed space habitats quite a lot on the channel and you will know they are a favorite of mine for colonization because we control every aspect of the environment and can fully customize it to our needs. 

As we discussed in the Life in a Space Colony series, it’s an interesting backwards aspect of colonization that you build your basic space stations before you colonize your planets, and of interstellar colonization that you’d also start with space habitats before colonizing planets. 

This allows us to circumvent the lighting problems of Proxima Centauri, as we can internally generate lighting by fission, fusion, solar power, or the use of mirrors to reflect in Proxima’s starlight, but coated to reflect away harmful or unnecessary waves with the remaining useful wavelengths entering a window in the habitat. 

As well as being able to rotate off axis so we can simulate a night phase or avoid reflecting too much light in during a flare. 

Each of these designs is very different in its requirements and internal environment, which compounds the issue of figuring out which design is optimal to build. 

Tempers flare and tensions run high, so in the end, no one design wins and, instead, a variety of designs are proposed and adopted for a swarm of habitats to be constructed to surround the star at various distances. 

That’s all very well and good but we now need the materials to actually build these habitats. 

There are other small, cold planets, asteroids and comets around, but they are not as easy to get to compared to Proxima b. 

Proxima b is a great candidate for mining as it is higher than Earth gravity and could stand to lose some mass as a result to make it more Earth-like. 

The extra gravity is not particularly difficult for fit people to live with either, even with the apparent increase in weight. 

We set about creating a mining operation supported by a planet-based colony for those who prefer living on a planet instead of living on a space station. 

We initially establish a small colony and nearby mining facility facing the star with direct overhead sunlight. 

This maximizes the solar energy collected using conventional solar panels but exposes the area to random deadly radiation flares. 

As a result, the colony and mining operations are installed into lava tubes under the surface that provide protection from the radiation and micrometeorite bombardment. 

As the lava tubes are mined, the empty space created is converted into living space. 

Our probes showed that Proxima b turns out to be an iron-rich planet similar to Mars in geological makeup. 

This is good for making structures, but it is lacking sufficient quantities of other elements vital to life, so we send out small spacecraft to locate smaller icy bodies orbiting Proxima Centauri further out that have trapped Carbon, Nitrogen and water ice. 

We wrap these bodies in insulation to prevent them from boiling away as they approach the star and sling them towards Proxima b. 

When they arrive, we process them into water, atmosphere and other materials for our future colonies. 

Mined minerals are mass driven from the planet’s surface into orbit. 

Even with the increased gravity, the lack of an atmosphere means mass drivers are a good way to get the mined materials off the planet, at least in the beginning. 

After we have mined enough material, we use that material to build an array of space mirrors and we build a second larger colony on the permanently dark side of Proxima b, away from the hellish radiation bursts. 

We dome this over and supply power to it using the array of orbital mirrors that reflect the light from the star to solar panels on the ground. 

We even reflect light from a special group of mirrors in the array that have the selective frequency reflection technology we designed for the habitats directly into the domed colony. 

The mirrors mean that little of the damaging radiation reaches the colony. 

It also means that we establish light and dark cycles on demand so we create day and night and can control the light levels, even during a flare, by quickly rotating the mirrors so that less light falls on the domed colony. 

Even on the dark side of Proxima b, our design ensures that the colony is not in perpetual darkness. 

Point defence systems take care of any space debris that would hit the domes. 

We build orbital rings and skyhooks and this helps to get materials off the planet a lot more easily. 

We also build nuclear power plants to help supply the increasing population and energy needs of the colonies. 

Now Earth’s Sun is 600 times brighter in all spectrums, but it is 200,000 times as bright in the range we can see than the light hitting Proxima b. 

This means that on the day side of Proxima, it is still not be very bright to our eyes, though it would still be bright. 

The Sun is 400,000 times brighter than a Full Moon on Earth, for instance, and certainly doesn’t seem that way as our eyes are logarithmic in their sensitivity. 

As a result, since we are filtering the frequencies of light hitting our mirrors, we actually reflect more visible light from Proxima onto our nightside colony domes on Proxima b than normally hits the day side of the planet. 

The dark side now seems brighter than the day side, at least those parts the mirrors are lighting. 

The second colony and its infrastructure allows us to really ramp up mining and we are soon producing the smaller O’Neill space habitats. 

In short order, we have enough habitats to offload our colonists into, those who came with us and the billions soon to begin arriving from our home solar system. 

It will be a constant squeeze and strain on the life support systems and food reserves as each new arrival is almost immediately tasked to mining or habitat construction, but as time goes on, there will be ample room for the population as more habitats are produced and humanity spreads out into the mix of habitats around the star. 

That is the cue for the colony ships to gear up for the next leg of our journey. 

Proxima Centauri is only the first of the stops on our journey. 

We have two more destinations ahead. 

It’s time to leave, but before we go, we take the opportunity to visit the colony on the dark side of Proxima b. 

The dome inside looks very much like Earth with plants, animals and arcologies living under a domed roof that receives what appears to be perfectly reproduced sunlight supplied by the orbital mirror array, and we are invited to step out from the dome in a spacesuit by an astronomer friend and walk on the barren rocky surface of the dark landscape. 

We gaze up and, even though we are in an alien system more than 4 light years from our home world, we are surprised that the stars look the same as those from Earth and we see all of the familiar constellations and stars we would see from Earth with one exception, a bright new star near Cassiopeia, which is the Sun from our home system. 

We can’t see it with our eyes, but we know even as we build here, vast stellasers are being built in orbit of the sun to push new and giant ships our way at high speeds, and we will soon need to build our own around Proxima Centauri to slow them down. 

40 trillion kilometers from us, the most massive construction project in history is working to build a laser highway and the ships which will venture onto it. 

We are told by our friend to gaze at the horizon. 

As we do, we see an even brighter star begin to rise. 

It is easily the brightest star in the sky and noticeably brighter than Venus was at its brightest from Earth, which was only barely visible during the daytime. 

The star we see is our next destination, the binary pair of Alpha Centauri A with a magnitude of -6.6 and B with a magnitude of -5.3. 

They are so close together at this distance that we see them as one blobby star. 

Our friend says they are so bright she has seen them with the naked eye from the surface of the day side of Proxima b. 

They are brighter here than Venus is on Earth, and the days here much dimmer in the visible range of light. 

This raises an interesting point in terms of my introductory remark about getting to see the sunrise three times a day. 

Proxima b has no natural days or nights and the stars rise because of the 11 day orbit that Proxima b has around Proxima Centauri, meaning we would see these stars rising and setting in an 11-day cycle. 

To be honest, though, this is a bright star in the night sky, not a sun, so this is not a sunrise the way we were expecting it. 

Technically, there are no sunrises here and any that exist are courtesy of our orbital mirror array. 

Our friend points out that Proxima is actually at its farthest point in its orbit from the binary pair, A and B. Proxima will get four times closer and as it gets closer, the A and B binary will get brighter in the sky and we will probably be able to tell them apart too, even with the naked eye in about a quarter of a million years. 

That experience spurs our interest to move onwards in our journey and we leave Proxima excited to visit humanity’s first binary pair. 

The somewhat depleted colony ships head off for a 0.2 light year journey to the Alpha Centauri A and B binary pair with the remainder of humanity’s vanguard. 

The 0.2 light year journey is nothing compared to the journey that the ships made to get to Proxima Centauri and this will be a much shorter trip. 

So, what awaits humanity in its first visit to a binary pair? 

You’ve probably heard that most stars are binary or multiple star systems, but that’s actually wrong. 

The bigger a star is, the more likely it is to have a companion, which makes sense when you think about it: more mass to pull things into orbit and more mass in that area to have formed another star. 

It was a lot easier to spot bigger stars and their companions in early astronomy, so it skewed our figures. 

According to current data, about two thirds of star systems are singular red dwarf systems. 

Due to their low luminosity, we couldn’t detect many red dwarfs until fairly recently and even Proxima was only discovered in 1915 in spite of being nearer to us than any other star. 

We normally classify binaries into two types, close and distant, but they can be anywhere from barely bound together, like with Proxima, where residents wouldn’t even know they lived in a binary till they developed advanced astronomy, to so close together they were literally touching and sharing a column of gas between them, akin to the Rocheworlds we discussed in the Double Planets episode way back. 

For our purposes today, we will define 3 kinds that are reasonably habitable. 

Close, medium, and far. 

For colonization, we really aren’t interested in ones where two binaries that are practically touching or one that is a short-lived supergiant. 

So we will say close is where the stars are close enough together that a habitable planet could orbit both in something vaguely approximating a normal orbit, medium is where the planet would orbit one, but the other is so close it seriously impacts the weather and biology, and far is where it’s just a very bright star if that, no more impacting life on that planet than Mars or Saturn impacts us. 

For this last case, Proxima is an example. 

Stable planetary orbits are a major issue for close binaries and still there for the medium variety, but let’s start with the first type, a planet orbiting both stars. 

This is known as a circumbinary planet, and we’ve found a fair number of these around stars as old as our own, so we can say they can be stable long enough for life to evolve. 

Orbital stability is only guaranteed for a planet if its distance from those stars is significantly higher than their distance from each other, which means circumbinary planets are outside of the habitable zone for all binary systems other than close binaries. 

You can’t have a habitable planet that orbits two stars who don’t have overlapping habitable zones. 

A planet orbiting both those stars will see the stars orbiting each other much more often than the planet completes an orbit around both, which might make for some weird calendars and those sun-orbits replacing your month or seasons, and indeed they will have big tidal and climate effects. 

That’s not the only weird calendar issue either. 

Earth technically does not orbit the Sun, but rather the common barycenter of the solar system. 

Since the Sun is 99.8% of the mass of the solar system and half the remainder is in Jupiter that barycenter is usually between the two but much closer to the Sun, either inside it at times, or just above the surface. 

The Earth/Luna barycenter is in our planet’s mantle, but regardless, the Earth spins every 24 hours and the Sun is pretty much in the same place. 

In fact the Earth spins 360 degrees every 23 hours and 56 minutes, a Sidereal Day, and we need to spin a bit more to see the Sun rise again, an extra four minutes. 

Around a close binary, this is not so. 

Your planet will still have a Sidereal Day of fixed length, but neither of those stars is going to rise at the same time throughout the year or even reset once a year. 

Sometimes they’ll both rise at the same time, sometimes hours apart. 

Meaning even if your planet wasn’t tilted like Earth is, your day length is going to vary over the course of a year and your shortest days, your winter solstice, where both suns rise and set about the same time, will also have your brightest noon, with both directly overhead at the same time. 

And this will happen multiple times throughout the year as they orbit each other much more quickly than the planet does, so again, a good alternative to months or classic seasons. 

Of course your planet can have axial tilt too and likely will, and it can also have a moon. 

That moon will be a bit weird too. 

Our Moon orbits us once a month and appears full when it is on the opposite side of Earth as the Sun is, and a new moon occurs when it is between us and the sun, or nominally between, when it actually intercepts the Sun-Earth orbital plane you get eclipses, every solar eclipse is also a new moon and every lunar eclipse a full moon. 

Needless to say, just like shadows cast in a room with two lights, having two suns changes all of this. 

Again though, the stars need to be closer to each other than to the planet for a circumbinary planet, so full moons won’t be a single moment of maximum illumination, with a night or two where the moon appears basically as a circular disc, but rather will last several nights. 

Alternatively a new moon with no visible disc at all would only ever occur if those two stars were eclipsing each other, and even when they are lined up the same east and west, they are likely to be a bit up and down from each other, not actually eclipsing, in which case your moon might show a decent crescent on top or bottom. 

Depending on the specifics of a system such a new moon might happen fairly regularly or so rarely it’s a major historical event, and solar eclipses where both stars and moon are all lined up ought to be super-rare or impossible. 

For a circumbinary planet though, there are still decently long night times. 

Just as we have places where the sun doesn’t set for months at a time - up near the poles - they would too, only lower and longer. 

While those two stars will both be very bright and visible, even if one was only a red dwarf, they still will both appear white to the eye, but there will be noticeable variation in coloring of objects on the planet based on which suns are up, much as clothing colors are more or less vivid in daylight, incandescent bulb, flourescent, or LED. 

You might also expect some changes to plants too, as they not only have to adjust to light changes over the day and year but intermittent changes of day length and brightness over periods of maybe a month or two. 

However, Alpha Centauri is that other type of binary system I mentioned, the medium case, and that is very different. 

Here, the stars are far enough apart no planet could orbit both and be habitable or stable, but also far enough apart that a planet could be stable and habitable around just one. 

There’s a gap by the way, where a pair of stars are too far apart for a habitable circumbinary planet but too close together for a stable orbiting planet around just one of them. 

Non-circumbinary planets orbit just one of those stars, also called S-type orbits, and they need to be at least five times closer to their primary than the other sun or be disrupted, and that value is very dependent on the relative mass of those stars to each other and their orbital eccentricity. 

Alpha Centauri A and B are 11 AU apart at their closest, 11 times farther apart than Earth and the Sun, and have a mean distance of double that, so habitable planets are viable here. 

A is bigger so a hypothetical planet around it would need to be a bit farther away from its sun than Earth is, as it is half again as bright and would provide illumination comparable to Earth’s at 22% farther away, and would have an orbital period of 470 days instead of 365 at that distance and that sun’s mass. 

Needless to say it could be closer or farther, or very different in mass, and we hardly have to abandon it if it is, we already discussed colonizing places like Venus, Mars, or various gas giant moons and we have just successfully colonized a hostile variable star’s planet, Proxima b, that makes those others look like child’s play. 

So, we get back to our story at this point. 

We send out probes again to both stars, A and B and confirm the existence of a rocky planet exactly where we want it in that habitable zone in orbit around A. We name it Aurora and we find a similar planet around B that we name Boreas. 

Both are around the same mass as Earth. 

Needless to say we are overjoyed by this lucky coincidence. 

We are not too likely to find life on any planets or moons in the Alpha Centauri system, at least not if we don’t find it in our own solar system first, which would imply it pops up and sticks around virtually anywhere, but making life there is actually quite viable. 

We confirm that there is no life on either Aurora or Boreas, but both planets have thick atmospheres similar to primordial Earth that makes terraforming them relatively easy. 

Alpha Centauri B is dimmer than A, and its closest approach to Aurora is 10 AU, about the same distance as Earth to Saturn, while its farthest is farther than Pluto, and it changes over an 80 year cycle, or more like 60 Auroran years. 

We land on Aurora and gaze up at the night sky. 

We see B at its closest is still less than a percent as bright as A, but even at its furthest, it is far brighter than a full moon. 

It will noticeably move around the sky over the years like planets do, but again its whole progress is over 80 years not a month like our moon or a year for the sun. 

From Earth, Proxima was 13,000 times farther from us than our Sun is from Earth and only a six-hundredth as luminous, and indeed it’s not even that bright to our eyes as it gives off far more of its light proportionally in the infrared spectrum we can’t see. 

That 600th is its bolometric luminosity, its total brightness in all spectrums. 

So 200,000 times dimmer and 13,000 times farther away means it appears to the naked eye some 30 Trillion times dimmer. 

Now, we can definitely see that on a dark night, but it has an apparent magnitude of about a 4 or 5, about as dim as we can see. 

Remember, while it was the closest star to us, we can’t see it with the naked eye, and it’s only 20 times closer and 400 times brighter to A and B. So we see it just as a regular star, and it is invisible during the day time. 

We were disappointed at Proxima b because we did not see a triple sunrise and we are again disappointed - no triple sunrises here either. 

On the bright side, though, there are two sunrises. 

Over the year that we work on the surface, we notice B circling around the planet relative to where A is. 

When Aurora is passing approximately in between them it has a normal day and a very bright night, when B is closest on its 80 year progression, nights are like an overcast day, while at its furthest in 80 years’ time, night will appear very overcast to twilight. 

At the full opposite, when both A and B are aligned with the planet on their far side, the day is just a little brighter than normal, barely noticeable. 

However, we get a fairly rare event when we get to the nights there where the twilight is replaced by a true night sky. 

In between that we experience extended days, with B rising before or setting after for prolonged periods of light in the twilight to overcast range, followed by a genuine but shorter night. 

As we move around the planet on our various tasks, we experience a lot of places with periods of extended light, tall mountain peaks and the poles experience protracted periods of having at least one sun up. 

This is of more than academic interest as photosynthesis can take place, if weakly, and we speculate that this is likely to mess around with all sorts of biological cycles, everything from seasonal growth to the hunting methods and anatomy of eyeballs in species as they evolve on the planet. 

Life here will evolve along its own path and species that adapt to the conditions best will thrive and survive. 

Those that stick to what they did on Earth will decline in the face of those adapters and die out. 

We are called away to the other planet to be terraformed, Boreas around Alpha Centauri B. As I said, this is hypothetical, except we don’t have to be too hypothetical when it comes to B. 

We detected a planet around B in 2012 that was later shown to be an error, we did find one around B in 2013. 

Unfortunately both the ghost planet and the new one are worse than Mercury in terms of heat, and while we have discussed colonizing hot planets before, or even stars themselves, planets like these would likely only be colonized in the temporary sense of mining them for raw materials to make space habitats instead. 

Fortunately Boreas is an Earth clone around B for this, and has an orbital distance of just 0.7 AU, like Venus, to be the same temperature as Earth, and orbits it every 225 days. 

That 80 year binary orbital period, which appears as 60 local years on Aurora is going to be 130 local years on Boreas. 

One would hope that our progress in colonizing star systems will be onward and upward, but history has shown that societies can lose technology and revert to pre-technology civilizations. 

If that happens here, we will hopefully have terraformed the planets sufficiently for them to exist without technological intervention. 

Assuming we did regress and then start re-establishing ourselves technologically, natives to either planet are going to have some calendar equivalent of a century that corresponds to that period. 

Amusingly, its duration would be the same for both even though we’d say it was 80 years, the Aurorans would say 60, and Boreans 130. 

I stress the calendar aspect as civilizations tend to ingrain astronomy and numerology into the mythology, mathematics, and early traditions. 

Not to mention we have a lot of authors here or folks who just enjoy worldbuilding so if you’re putting together some hypothetical devolved society, alien race or fantasy planet those are points to know. 

Incidentally, if you want to figure these out for yourselves on hypothetical stars, just check that star’s brightness relative to our Sun, use the bolometric value, take the square root of that and that’s how many AU away it would orbit. 

Then you need to calculate its orbital period based on that, classic Kepler method but don’t forget to change the star’s mass. 

This is harder for a close binary case but still works fine for our medium, non-circumbinary case where the planet only orbits one star. 

Or at least, it will most of the time anyway. 

Alpha Centauri A is about three times brighter than B but conditions on Boreas are fairly similar to Aurora. 

Those protracted twilights or very bright nights are about three times brighter, though to the naked eye, will seem about the same, and any plants adapted to make use of that light will fare much better and be more likely to thrive. 

Similarly, while A won’t seem nearly as bright in the sky as B when sharing it during the day, it’s a lot closer and a period where A was at noon while B was setting or rising would have A brighter in the sky than B. 

That might make for an interesting protracted dawn because A might only provide twilight or overcast lighting but it will still be blue sky when it’s directly overhead, while you get that red outward rainbow from B, so you’d get some strange color bands across the sky. 

You’d have those on Aurora too but not as pronounced. 

On the biology of the planets, tides on Earth play an important role in ecosystems. 

There is some compelling evidence that life could not have evolved on Earth without them. 

On Earth, we have tides thanks to the Moon, but in Alpha Centauri, to bastardize a quote from Back to the Future: “Moons? 

Where we're going, we don't need Moons!” On an ocean-containing world around Alpha Centauri B or Alpha Centauri A, we would get tides from the presence of the binary star tugging at the water. 

The stars are much further away than our Moon is from our planet but Alpha Centauri A is 30 million times as massive as our Moon and Alpha Centauri B is 25 million times as massive. 

The effect of gravity drops off with the square of distance. 

At the closest, they are about 10AU away from the planet, compared with a paltry 0.00257 AU for our Moon from Earth. 

This means that for an ocean world orbiting Alpha Centauri A, tides caused by Alpha Centauri B would be 60% higher than here on Earth and for such a world orbiting around Alpha Centauri B, tides would be double that experienced on Earth. 

Usually, when we want to communicate with other worlds orbiting other stars, communication times are upwards of years, but not in Alpha Centauri as communicating with our friends on Aurora, they are able to receive radio messages transmitted from here on Boreas in just over an hour, even though they are technically orbiting a different star! 

We ultimately achieve the same level of colonization in the A and B systems, including the space habitats that we perfected when colonizing Proxima. 

Humanity is certainly in a different place now and has come a long way from those early days when we were going to be snuffed out by that black hole. 

We are now getting excited about using Alpha Centauri as launch point to colonize the rest of galaxy now that we have a colony fleet and lots of experienced colonists sitting around, but that is a different story. 

If you’re curious about some of those propulsion systems that might take us to the stars, try out the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium, and if you want to look more at the journey through space or those early colony days far from Earth, see the Life in a Space Colony Series. 

However that is the end of the Outward Bound Series, at least chronologically. 

We might revisit it to add some episodes looking at Mercury or Neptune or one of the bigger asteroids but this is as far out as we’re going. 

We’ve been to the planets, many a moon, and even out to the Oort Cloud, we headed back to colonize the Sun and then out again today to colonize other Suns, and from here it would continue on to our other series looking at interstellar colonization and travel. 

When I first started this series, I faced the dilemma, a good one to have no doubt, of choosing between providing a brief overview of the science that is focused on relevant portions, or diving deep into the science but covering much fewer ideas in each video. 

Neither approach felt right to me, and I didn’t know how best to appeal to my varied audience. 

I was then contacted by Brilliant, which has courses that explore the underlying physics and astronomy for many of the concepts we needed to properly look at here, about a sponsorship opportunity. 

This made me feel comfortable in covering just what is relevant for a solid understanding of the video, while recommending folks that wanted to explore and master these concepts to check out Brilliant. 

The first message on Hohmann Transfer Orbits was such a perfect fit for the channel, and many of you appreciated the deeper insight that Brilliant offered. 

We can draw on their quizzes, to help us stretch our imagination and discover what else is possible. 

For instance if you want to be able to calculate out stuff like how long a planet’s year would be in the habitable zone of an alien sun, they’ve got a great course on Keplerian Orbits and when you’re done with it, along with what we’ve discussed today, you’ll be able to create any solar system you like and know all its specifics. 

Isn't that amazing?

And also, if you're ready to expand your mental toolbox, the first 42 people will get 20% off the annual Premium subscription. 

That's the subscription I've been using to entertain myself with thought-provoking puzzles. 

We might be done for now with the Outward Bound series but next week we’ll return to the Upward Bound series to continue our look at orbital development, and look at some necessities we’ll have to have in order to do that. 

We will also look at Kessler Syndrome, the possibility of a runaway destruction of orbital platforms that could leave space littered with dangerous debris, and what we could do about it. 

In the event of a war in space destroying such equipment you could close a planet off for generations just from the wreckage. 

The week after that we will jump back into interstellar space to look at Interstellar Warfare, and find out what the #1 rule governing space warfare will be, and the week after that we will return to the Civilizations at the End of Time series for Dying Earth, and what civilizations will do when the planet and sun they’ve always depended upon begin to perish.

Orbital Infrastructure
---
  
2018-03-01  
https://youtu.be/HkU85zKxK-s  

---

Many people commute as much as a hundred kilometers to work every day. 

Interestingly, this is also about how far it is to low orbit. 

If we ever want to have a truly serious presence in space, we are going to need a lot of infrastructure in orbit. 

Today we are going to try painting a picture of what that would look like, and review some of the challenges we have to overcome to achieve it. 

Many of those challenges get far easier as you get more and more infrastructure built up there, but one, the danger of orbital debris, increases as you get more potential sources of debris in orbit. 

You can also have a runaway chain-reaction of destruction we’ll discuss later today known as Kessler Syndrome which has the potential to cut you off from space altogether. 

So how do we start building up that infrastructure and what should it be? 

There are many approaches and since last time in the series we discussed spaceports in terms of the Gateway Foundations’ design, I thought we’d just pick up from there. 

This concept of building in space is hardly new, but in recent years there has been an increasing focus on the use of robots and drones for doing the work, so we’ll spend some time on that too. 

Whether new plans or old, what they all seem to have in common is a big problem of what exactly you are manufacturing up there and what the infrastructure and factories would be for. 

As I mentioned in the Interplanetary Trade episode, in the long term Earth really has nothing it needs to import besides precious minerals like gold and platinum and rare earth elements, and Earth’s obvious exports are people and information. 

The latter doesn’t require much infrastructure in space. 

Earth churns out endless volumes of science, movies, TV shows, etc and can export them by simple radio or laser broadcast. 

I made those statements in the context of interplanetary trade and, in so-doing, I lumped Earth’s space-based industries in Near Earth Orbit with ground-based manufacture. 

Instead, today we will separate the industries on Earth from those in Orbit around Earth. 

We actually don’t need much infrastructure to receive precious metals from asteroid mining. 

It takes a lot of fuel to move materials at interplanetary speeds so by and large you’d do your refining on location and send it to Earth in a pod to aerobrake in our atmosphere and be picked up by a ship. 

You wouldn’t send it to Earth orbit for smelting and transport it down. 

However, the value of refined metals like Aluminium and Steel in LEO cannot be overstated. 

The budding space construction industry created by a project like building a spaceport will be very hungry for raw material inputs, and launching all of them from earth is expensive. 

Many folks will be aware of the recent successful Falcon Heavy launch that put Elon Musk’s Tesla into a solar orbit that will pass by Mars. 

I have to admire the publicity stunt of that launch, especially the inclusion of “The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams in the glovebox, as well as a towel and a sign saying "Don't Panic" and, of course, the data storage device with Isaac Asimov’s classic space trilogy on it. 

Importantly for our purposes today, though, the Falcon Heavy will allow us to put payloads of up to 64 metric tonnes, a mass greater than a 737 jetliner loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel into low Earth orbit in a single launch. 

It is the most powerful operational rocket by far and it can deliver more than two and a half times the payload that the Space Shuttles could. 

We could actually carry the million pound mass required to recreate the entire International Space Station in only 7 launches of the Falcon Heavy. 

We haven’t seen something that powerful since the Saturn V rockets last flew astronauts to the Moon in the early 1970s. 

Unlike the Saturn V rockets, though, the Falcon Heavy is reusable and that should significantly lower the cost of launching materials into space. 

SpaceX aims to have up to 2 launches a day. 

That’s not to say it will be cheap, but it will mean that we can more cheaply bootstrap a space-based industry from Earth to start mining the materials we need in space from asteroids and the Moon. 

Orbital infrastructure to accommodate those activities would mostly be places like our Spaceport for processing all the people coming and going. 

For other infrastructure, we have to ask, what you would actually benefit from building in space. 

What products are better built there rather than on Earth? 

Or in-situ on whatever planet, moon, or asteroid that either needs them or extracts the raw materials for them? 

Not to mention the things than can be done in space or zero G which can’t be done here on earth. 

To manufacture anything up in space implies that it has some advantage over doing it on Earth first then shipping it to space. 

That could be something like a large spaceship or station that couldn’t be built on Earth and shipped up, 100 meter plus telescopes, or something like a water recycling plant, because it’s cheaper to recycle water than import it up from Earth. 

Similarly, for anything wanted far from Earth, like asteroid mining equipment, being able to make it near Earth, but not having to drag it out of our full gravity well is quite advantageous. 

However, there are features of space that are beneficial to some manufacturing. 

Solar Power is vastly more reliable in space, where there are never any clouds and where night time is very short. 

The higher your orbit the less of it is in Earth’s Shadow, and while low orbit satellites spend a lot of time in Earth’s shadow, it’s still less than an hour, not many hours of twilight and night like on Earth, meaning you don’t need as much battery capacity. 

Similarly, micro-gravity has significant manufacturing advantages. 

There’s no pressure in the hard vacuum of space either, so many materials typically go straight from solid to gas, and there are some manufacturing techniques that use vacuum and would use them more if getting a near perfect vacuum wasn’t such a pain as it is here on Earth. 

One example is solar panel manufacture, which often includes a step that needs to be done in a vacuum and this is an expensive part of the process to achieve here on Earth. 

Many crystals form best in microgravity too and those have applications in industries like medicine, optics and electronics. 

Another technique that is much easier in microgravity is microencapsulation, which has applications in adhesives, anti-corrosive coatings, pharmaceuticals, self-healing coatings, DNA protection from degradation and sample storage. 

Interestingly, many of these applications will not only be useful as export products back to Earth but will also be very useful to the space infrastructure itself. 

We are already aware, though, of a technology that we can only make in high quality and quantities in microgravity that will be the next iteration in fiber optics and lasers. 

These are called heavy metal fluoride glasses, the best known of which is a family called ZBLANs, named using the first letters of the chemical symbols for the metal atoms that they are composed of: Zirconium, Barium, Lanthanum, Aluminium and Sodium, that last one has the chemical symbol Na, so that’s where the N comes from. 

They make the silica-based fiber optics we currently use look like a horse and cart compared to the sports cars of ZBLANs. 

They would solve many of today’s problems we have in spectroscopy, sensing, laser power delivery and fiber lasers and amplifiers. 

Given that they also have military applications, there is a strong economic and political push to manufacture these. 

On Earth, ZBLANs are difficult to make in high quality because gravity causes the formation of crystals in the structure and these crystals disrupt its desirable optical characteristics. 

Doing this manufacturing in microgravity avoids this problem because crystal formation is all but eliminated. 

A kilometer run of ZBLAN fiber optic cable was 3D printed on the International Space Station last year and this was returned to Earth last month. 

We will probably hear more about that industrial experiment in the coming months. 

The importance of this experiment is that it is arguably the first one to test true industrialization in space and this shows we are on the cusp of our move into space industrialization. 

We are only at the beginning of our understanding of how to do space-based chemistry and how we can perform industrial processes in a vacuum and microgravity, but based on results so far, there will be many more useful and innovative processes and products that can be produced more easily in space than down on Earth. 

Now I noted at the beginning that orbital space isn’t much further than many folks commute daily, and as we saw in the Orbital Rings episode it is possible to get huge amounts of people and material up to space fast and cheap enough for daily commutes, but more importantly the actual commute time to low orbit is about one millisecond. 

That’s because you don’t have to have equipment being run in orbit by people on site, and unlike robots sent to other planets and asteroids, they don’t have to be smart either. 

They just need to be something a human can decently control by remote. 

So you don’t even have to commute to work, you just log in at home, and even time lag when the drone is on the other side of the planet is short enough you’d barely be able to notice it. 

However if your robot has even a small amount of AI built into it, one person may be able to control many drones, Bots or PODs performing the most simple to complex tasks. 

This addition of AI also makes large scale unmanned robotic missions much more viable than they are today, because an AI can compensate for communications lag. 

Needless to say we don’t have many drones and interfaces quite up to that quality yet, but when it comes to telepresence surgery, we have been doing that since the Lindbergh Operation back in 2001, when a surgeon remotely removed a patient’s gallbladder. 

The surgeon was in New York directly controlling a robot operating on the patient in France. 

Nearly two decades later, many other examples of this telepresence surgery have been performed, but it is still not the norm because the need for it is marginal, meaning it is not widespread or cost-effective. 

Having said that, though, the technology is proven and available for when we need it. 

Also needless to say that would alter a lot of Earth-based mining and manufacturing too. 

Even ignoring manufacturing dangers, we have a lot of factories that would benefit from being remotely operated in conditions that are rough on humans. 

A pretty big chunk of infrastructure in space is going to be centered around humans, again why we began our look at this concept last time with spaceports, and why we’d probably see a surprising amount of space based hotels or even private homes. 

It’s not something we tend to think about much but your big issue with a private home in space is the size needed to supply decent artificial gravity by spin, and that can be gotten around by having many such homes on the ends of tethers like pods on a carousel wheel. 

On top of those we have 4 major sub-categories of early infrastructure we’d expect to see. 

The first is power generation. 

As I said, solar is more reliable in space and also very easy to beam around. 

You can have panels on a given installation but you can also beam it from more specialized power collectors as they don’t need to worry about the atmosphere getting in the way and keeping a beam on target and focused to a spot a few hundred or thousand kilometers away in space is pretty simple. 

However we can also beam that power down and out. 

The down part is familiar, instead of using up useful space down on Earth you collect power up in space and beam it down in concentrated fashion to collectors on Earth. 

Likely you’d use several collectors as the satellite moves around the planet and can re-divert the beam if you’ve got problems from clouds or breakdown or whatever. 

The beaming out part is a little less familiar, though we’ve talked about that before here and the new Project Starshot has helped familiarize folks with it too. 

You can push things with light, up to truly high speeds, like the Laser Highway we’ve discussed, but you can also heat or power things with such beams and that’s handy for spaceships too. 

The notion of an Ion Drive is one that accelerates slowly but to a very high speed, by pushing propellant particles out at very high speed, and that’s very appealing for interplanetary travel or moving around things already in orbit where you don’t need a high thrust, just a long slow and steady one. 

It still takes fuel though, both for the propellant and whatever is giving it the energy to heat that propellant up, and it’s common to want to run an ion drive either on a nuclear reactor, which has a fair amount of problems attached to its use, or on solar, which isn’t terribly dense, particularly as you get further from the sun, and means a ton of panels you have to drag along and protect from micrometeors. 

A beam going to a ship though, be it a ship or satellite in orbit or something moving between planets, can provide the energy to superheat that propellant, saving you a lot of mass, and this actually works even if you are trying to approach the beam, which is shoving on you, because the beam carries less momentum than the propellant it will energize does. 

And while some materials are better than others, you can pretty much use anything as that propellant if you have to. 

A large percentage of the energy an ion drive uses is for ionizing that propellant, some being much lower energy to do, so if your power is coming from an external source you can consider propellants that are easier to obtain economically or in an emergency. 

Short of us developing a viable commercial fusion reactor, solar power in space is going to be a huge chunk of the orbital infrastructure. 

Indeed it might still be preferable over fusion in many cases. 

To power things in orbit, to send power down to earth, to beam power out to ships or installations far from Earth. 

It also has the dual advantage of being handy for vaporizing space junk and meteors or giving them a shove. 

Of course it’s a little problematic in that you can also vaporize things down on Earth, so you want to design all such beams to have a maximum focus spot that can’t blow things up fast down on the planet or for ones where we need a tight focus, like for hitting distant spaceships, use those frequencies of the spectrum that are most disrupted by our Atmosphere, or use enhanced adaptive optics to jumble the spectra when not pointing exactly where desired. 

Such solar arrays would be a huge chunk of the orbital infrastructure but look like an even bigger portion as they’d generally be slim and wide. 

Now you might be thinking that if we did enough of them they might block sufficient light getting to the planet, but you would need a lot of those and you can also place them in higher orbits where they get blocked by the earth’s shadow less anyway, and you can always have them with a counterweight so they can tilt on their axis when directly between the Sun and Earth to let light pass uninterrupted. 

Though you might not want to. 

A problem every technological civilization is likely to face is their planet getting hotter. 

Not just from greenhouse gases but by sheer energy needs. 

A few hundred terawatts of fusion power might be totally carbon neutral but it still puts out heat. 

So you might actually want to introduce solar shades to block some of that light, or some of its less useful frequencies like infrared, from hitting Earth. 

A millimeter-thick chunk of aluminum foil as big as a football field would not be big enough to be seen obstructing sunlight to us on the ground, is pretty cheap per unit of area, and could presumably be mass manufactured up there far more easily than anything else, meter for meter. 

They are also fairly immune to micrometeor damage for much the same reason it’s hard to destroy a sheet on a clothesline with a pistol, the bullet goes straight through without really doing functional damage. 

Done properly you get a mirror, with which you can bounce light into a close collector dish which can then spit that radiation out as power too. 

A solar panel doesn’t have to be as wide as all the light it collects, if it’s got a mirror and dish concentrating that light for it instead. 

So you can handle concerns about a warming planet while increasing your power supply for beaming down to the planet, using up there, or beaming off to distant objects. 

These same kind of giant mirrors can be used for huge telescopes too, though you’d want to ratchet up the quality of the mirrors a lot. 

I want to save ridiculously big telescopes for its own episode down the road but once you are up in space, building in space, you can make things that make the Hubble Telescope look like something you’d buy in a toy store, and able to directly image exoplanets. 

Indeed you can make planet sized telescopes, thinner than paper, again something we’ll discuss another day. 

Another big part of that early infrastructure is going to be fueling stations. 

As I said last time, you can predict a lot of things you’d want on or near a spaceport by looking at what we keep near airports, seaports, train stations, and truck stops here on Earth. 

You’d expect to see these as parts of spaceports but you might prefer to keep your fuel in the same orbit but a couple kilometers forward or behind, and anything automated, be it automated spaceships or just satellites with fuel for station-keeping, have no need to dock at a full blown spaceport unless they need hands-on maintenance. 

They wouldn’t necessarily need to dock either, those fuel depots might have bots that could fly out with fuel to them directly then come back. 

You also don’t necessarily need fuel for station keeping either, you could shove them around with beams but we also have the electrodynamic tethering approach we discussed in the Skyhooks episode, where by using a long tether with power running through it we can magnetically push off Earth’s magnetosphere. 

All of which means you’ve got an awful lot of stuff in space. 

Not just ships and stations but huge solar arrays and long tethers. 

Space is big. 

Really big. 

Even just around Earth it is hard to believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. 

However that stuff in orbit is spinning around the planet several hundred times faster than a car on the highway, and so each bit covers a lot of ground and even a very tiny bit can smash into things with all the kinetic energy of a car on the highway. 

That screwdriver you lost working on the outside of a space station, that floated away at walking speed, can slam into another orbiting object on a different trajectory like a cannon shot, and in the process throw out more debris that scatters everywhere smacking into more things, which shoot out more debris and so on. 

We see an example of this in the film Gravity. 

If you’ve got a lot of material in orbit, it’s potentially possible for a single small piece of trash to set off an apocalypse in orbit. 

Down on the ground too, since a lot of the bigger items we might put up there could have bits and pieces fall down big enough to survive re-entry and leave a crater somewhere, possibly someone’s home. 

So even infrastructure on Earth probably wouldn’t survive unscathed but up in orbit you could potentially have a total wipe out of all your equipment and personnel. 

To make this worse, while a lot of that scattered debris would fall down and burn up, a lot of it would persist in orbit for potentially many years. 

This Collision cascade, or ablation cascade effect, is also known as Kessler Syndrome, for Donald Kessler who noticed the possibility in 1978. 

Forty years later it’s still a serious concern. 

Right now there are a couple thousand satellites in orbit, and nearly a million pieces of space junk a centimeter across or larger floating around. 

That junk kills about one satellite a year. 

The more objects you add, the higher the probability of a strike, and the higher the number of secondary debris you’d get from that collision. 

At a certain density you can get a feedback runaway process that ends in everything up there obliterated. 

When it’s over, everything is wrecked and you can’t put anything new up for a long time, as all that debris is still up there. 

Low orbit, the place we most like to put stuff and have to pass through to get to higher orbits, would have the most initial debris but also the shortest dwell time as the very thin atmosphere up there causes enough drag to slowly de-orbit debris to burn up in the atmosphere. 

The higher you go, the thinner that is, and the longer it lasts, potentially persisting millenia in the higher orbits. 

You can’t launch through that, it would be like jogging through a minefield. 

So until it clears out, either naturally which could take generations, or artificially, your planet is grounded, nobody is going anywhere. 

Now if this happens, there are some approaches we can take to speed up clearance of debris. 

You can also potentially armor your spaceships up like tanks but needless to say that takes a lot of mass, something that’s always to be avoided with spaceships, especially ground-to-space varieties as opposed to space-to-space. 

However ideally you want to be able to stop the cascade before that domino effect begins. 

There’s many ways to do this, either clearing it afterward or stopping it before the runaway. 

Figuring out the best approach based on your technology is going to be a high priority for any spacefaring civilization, be it us in twenty years or some Kardashev 2 civilization building a Dyson Swarm, for which Kessler Syndrome at a solar-system wide scale would be absolutely terrifying. 

This starts with detection. 

You have to start by figuring out what the minimum size is that you need to intercept, based on your standard shielding and armor and how much pounding your paper thin solar shades can absorb. 

Now in space you can use pretty much any wavelength you want for radar, so you want something most material is going to reflect and has a wavelength smaller than that minimum size you need to intercept. 

Then you need to flood orbital space with that wavelength with a ton of emitters and receivers picking up every little fragment. 

As I mentioned there are quite a few ways to deal with space junk but one of the preferred ones proposed is called a laser broom and this can be deployed in space or from the ground if you are cleaning up the mess afterwards. 

A powerful laser could flat out vaporize the debris but the laser broom just heats one side of the object up. 

This causes ablation, where the material evaporates a bit, which produces a little thrust. 

Knocking the material out of its current somewhat stable orbit into one which decays faster. 

That’s a good way to deal with a cloud of debris, post runaway collisions, but you can also use it to nudge a bit of debris on a collision vector with an object, preventing the runaway effect in the first place. 

By embiggening the laser, we could provide a bigger shove or outright vaporize it; it’s not a good and efficient approach when you have a ton of debris but good for stopping that from happening in the first place and another reason to have lots of power collectors and power beaming stations in space. 

It’s also a good reason to include point-defense systems on a station. 

Other approaches for mass clearance would include everything from shooting debris with aerogel bullets to de-orbit them or launching a big nuke up to explode and clear a sector right before a ship passes through, but ultimately we want to prevent the cascade from ever starting. 

The general approach would be to recycle everything you can, blow what you can’t into a fast-decaying orbit to burn up, tether every piece of external equipment and tool to the ship or station, and have little drones to run off and grab things that get lost. 

One of the Gateway Foundation designs is just that, the Errant Object Retrieval Program or EOR. 

The current design for the ISS has an Observer Drone that heads over to an active work area when an EVA begins, and is packed full of object recognition software and knows to look for telltales of lost gear, like when it begins spinning around its own center of mass. 

There’s no air in space so stuff almost always tumble when it gets loose. 

Later generations of Observer Drones in many different sizes will see extensive use in space construction offering numerous viewpoints to Construction Control. 

Small Observers will get in tight to inspect welding and big ones will survey the whole worksite. 

The second part of that is the amusing but aptly named “Frog’s Tongue” Drone because it roams around the station hull with the EVA astronaut and extends an armature to knab loose gear. 

This wily but versatile drone will later become the mule that carries astronauts tools and parts in tool boxes to a work site. 

Right now an Astronaut has all this gear attached to their spacesuits, very cumbersome. 

And last of this trio is the Retriever Drone which has its own jets for chasing after something that’s gotten out of range of the Frog’s Tongue lash, be it lost gear or even an Astronaut. 

These specific designs are intended for the current ISS but represent the basic concept of drone we will want with all our orbital infrastructure to minimize space junk, and of course with more sophistication they could form automated repair for smaller installations, either remote controlled or via AI. 

As we do more construction up there we will need to worry about entire structural segments getting lost too, if we’re talking about a piece of truss like from Tethers Unlimited’s SpiderFab and Trusselator or Gateway’s Segment Assembly Line, you don’t want a big truss whirling through orbital space, those don’t even need to be going orbital speeds to ruin your day, and you need to be looking at a large detection and retrieval or elimination system spanning orbital space if you’re doing a lot of construction and manufacturing in orbit. 

With space manufacture though we are worried about more than just lost or broken tools and equipment causing debris, we also have to worry about space pollution. 

The problem is that if we allow say, water, to escape, it could freeze into hypersonic deadly hail. 

The same is true of welded metals. 

The technology needed to capture that debris at source is probably relatively simply but has yet to be tested and it is probably well past time that we got going on preventing this type of problem before it gets to Kessler Syndrome levels. 

Another option is to reuse your old infrastructure by recycling it. 

3D printing will form a big part of space infrastructure for several reasons. 

Firstly, it is easier and considerably cheaper to ship a printer and the raw materials up into space and have it print parts on demand than it is to ship up every conceivable item you might need. 

Secondly, and more importantly from the Kessler Syndrome point of view, 3D printing materials generally allows them to be recycled. 

This is being taken seriously by the various space agencies and is actually being tested early this year. 

The Refabricator Experiment is a 3D printing experiment scheduled for immanent launch to the International Space Station. 

It will process plastic feedstock through multiple printing and recycling cycles to evaluate how many times the plastic materials can be re-used in the microgravity environment before their polymers degrade to unacceptable levels. 

Skip on any of these preventative measures and your very expensive and valuable orbital infrastructure could go crashing and burning down into the atmosphere. 

Needless to say, intentionally spraying a planet’s orbit with a billion pea-sized metal spheres is a pretty good way to cripple their orbital infrastructure and defenses, something we will talk about more when we get to Planetary Invasions later this year, in continuance of our series on Space Warfare. 

First though we will look at Interstellar warfare next week, and contemplate how you might actually go about fighting engagements that could take centuries and some of the over-the-top weapons systems Kardashev 2 civilizations might employ against each other. 

The week after that, we’ll contemplate the end of civilization when our Planet and Sun die, and how to avoid it, in Civilizations at the End of Time: Dying Earth. 

And the week after that we’ll contemplate circumventing space travel entirely with teleportation, and ask if such a technology could ever exist and how we might do it. 

We’ll also look at some creative approaches and examples of its use in fiction, such as our book of the month, Richard K. Morgan’s novel “Altered Carbon” For alerts when those and other episodes come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel. 

I also wanted to thank the Gateway Foundation and Orbital Assembly for their help with this episode and the last one in the series on Spaceports, they have a kickstarter for their drone development just starting up, and are looking for volunteers to help on their projects.

Fermi Paradox: Sleeping Giants
---
  
2018-02-15  
https://youtu.be/v9sh9NpL4i8  

---

We often look up at the stars and ask, “if the Universe is so big and ancient, why aren’t there big and ancient civilizations spanning the galaxy?” But what if there are, and they’re just asleep? 

It’s been a while since we visited the Fermi Paradox directly on this channel and it’s probably overdue. 

In the past, we’ve looked at almost every solution folks have presented about the Fermi Paradox, but there’s one group of solutions we’ve mostly skipped. 

A variation known as the Aestivation Hypothesis has developed within that group since the last time we discussed the Fermi Paradox. 

So now seems like a good time to look at these solutions more in depth. 

Interestingly, this also happens to be a category of solutions that predates the Fermi Paradox itself. 

The Fermi Paradox is fundamentally a response to our deepening understanding of the antiquity of our world and the evolutionary path of life on it, coupled with the realization that our galaxy hosts hundreds of billions of stars, which make up less than a billionth of all stars in the visible universe. 

That took a long time to sink into our collective consciousness and it really wasn’t until we were taking our first steps toward designing spaceships that it slammed home. 

Yet, many years before that happened, some folks were considering it. 

One of those was H.P. 

Lovecraft, best known for his Cthulhu Mythos, but not very well known in his time, probably because these ideas hadn’t really had time to sink in. 

This brings us to our Audible Book of the Month, H.P. 

Lovecraft’s “At the Mountains of Madness”. 

This is one of the best known stories that began that mythos, focusing on the discovery of a truly ancient and alien civilization found in the depths of Antarctica, whose existence covers vast amounts of space and time. 

This is one of the earliest examples in fiction of trying to come to terms with the idea that if life can arise naturally, with all the countless billions of worlds, many predating us by billions of years, there has to be a reason why they aren’t seemingly everywhere. 

You can pick up a free copy of the story today and also get a 30-day trial of Audible, just use my link, Audible.com/Isaac or text isaac to 500-500. 

A regular aspect of Lovecraft’s work is that these ancient beings share nothing of our own worldview. 

They’re not so much evil as operating under totally alien outlooks. 

That’s important to the Fermi Paradox because our broadest group of possible solutions invariably revolve around alien behavior and motivation and we don’t want to make too many assumptions in that regard. 

Even just reading material written by fellow humans only a century or two old can reveal some huge differences in perspective and ethics, and I’ll throw that in as a warning about our book of the month too. 

Anytime you read a classic, and many of our books of the month tend to be, you can encounter some shocking views and that’s especially the case for Lovecraft. 

For our purposes today though, that’s actually a bit of a benefit because it serves as an example of just how much of a change a few generations can make to a single culture who shares the same traditions and biology. 

A truly alien mindset might easily be incomprehensible in its motives, though as we’ve discussed in regard to Artificial Intelligence, it will probably tend to be internally fairly logical and consistent. 

An AI might be more human than an alien, for having been made and raised by humans, or even more alien than actual aliens, since those should presumably share the same basic biological motives evolution would tend to pressure a species towards. 

However, I’ve often noted that classical evolution makes little sense once you get technology. 

If you extrapolate that out onto geological timelines rather than just envisioning a species a few centuries ahead, you can end up with something just as detached from evolutionary roots as an AI would be, from centuries of genetic or cybernetic alteration. 

You can expect that they will be sufficiently logical, but in truth folks already are and we can see how irrational that often seems. 

As best as I can tell, just about every human who has ever lived has been logical, their personal assumptions, training, experience, and worldview just flavor where that logic starts, how well it is performed, and where they subconsciously tend to steer it. 

If you begin with very alien biology and motivations, that can end at some very logical but mystifying behaviors and opinions. 

I wanted to stress that point because the Fermi Paradox has a vast number of suggested solutions, as we detailed in the Fermi Paradox Compendium, but most tend to fall into three broad categories. 

The first being that they don’t exist, the second that we can’t detect them, and third that we can’t recognize them. 

Even most of our solutions we had to classify as miscellaneous, arguably weren’t outside those three, but more of a hybrid between two of three categories. 

The first, that they don’t exist, only relies on motivation of the alien in a very minimal way. 

It’s the category for solutions ranging from life being very uncommon to intelligence evolving very rarely, but it also includes that we might be unnatural in origin – an extreme fluke of probability like a Boltzmann Brain, any scenario where we were created by a god or aliens or computer programmers – or that we are natural enough but prone to killing ourselves off with our own technology. 

Both of those, unnatural origin and suicide by technology, do have a motivation component, though for the former it is the creator’s motivations that matter, not ours, and for the latter it’s more of a lack of clear perspective, you assume the folks wanted to survive so they did not detect the threat, or could not bring themselves to recognize it. 

I’ll get to the second category shortly, but first let’s deal with the third category, that mostly contains similar examples. 

It’s the one for things like aliens walking quietly among us while we are unable to recognize they do, either through outright denial or that we lack the context to even see it, as we could walk right past a sentient tree or stone and not realize they had thoughts. 

We don’t see them doing anything to indicate intelligence, but we have to acknowledge that maybe their motives are simply so different that their actions appear as simple random noise or coincidence to us. 

A big swarm of mosquitoes that was actually a hive mind might, very logically, be motivated simply to gather blood and reproduce. 

Now that example can be rebutted by pointing out that any sort of intelligence or network requires maintenance and resources, so if it isn’t providing an obvious benefit it probably should not exist, and since a big swarm of mosquitoes ought to act that way anyway, they derive no benefit from a hive mind directing them to do just that. 

When we get into the second category of solutions to the Fermi Paradox, that we can’t detect them, we do a lot of those kind of rebuttals. 

Someone says the Universe is full of aliens but they all keep small civilizations and hide them, and we examined that in the Hidden Aliens episode and concluded that it was not a very logical survival strategy based on known science, hence it would be very weird for EVERY alien species to do that. 

The alien civilization series differs from the Fermi Paradox episodes mostly in that it is entirely likely, even probable, that lots of civilizations do try to hide, so in Alien Civilizations episodes we can look at them, whereas in Fermi Paradox episodes we aren’t interested in such civilizations unless they offer a solution to the Fermi Paradox, and they don’t, any more than an entire village hiding does, if one member instead stands up on a hill with a beacon fire and megaphone shouting out town gossip and census data. 

We call this exclusivity or rather non-exclusivity and it tends to poke holes in virtually every category two solution, and indeed today’s case of sleeping civilizations is not entirely an exception. 

Maybe we can’t detect aliens because they don’t use radio in favor of something better. 

Beyond radio being the detection method the SETI Institute likes to suggest, it’s just one of many methods which would not be interfered with by better communication systems. 

This still ignores that you’d expect at least one civilization to maintain a classic radio beacon just to say “Greetings, new species, welcome to the Galaxy”. 

Exclusivity is simultaneously a tricky concept, and a simple one. 

Interstellar travel should be exclusive to species that understand basic math and physics, since it’s hard to make rocket ships - let alone fusion or antimatter drives without it. 

Alternatively, we could not say space travel is exclusive to democracies, or a particular economic system, since the entire space race was essentially a proxy war between two ideologies with polar opposite views on such matters and both achieved great successes. 

We can say space travel ought to be exclusive to folks who understand algebra, but not that it is exclusive to capitalists or communists, democracies or oligarchies, benevolent dictators or military despots, theists or atheists, and so on. 

We might be able to say it is exclusive to folks who value technology, as we’d not expect Luddites to do space, but even that’s kind of dubious. 

One only needs to embrace the technologies specifically necessary for travel and even then, just the blueprints, not the science behind them, and a civilization might embrace science, and then turn against it. 

Similarly we couldn’t completely rule out something evolving in space, big space squid that hatch from small asteroids and go floating around sucking up sunlight and asteroids and space dust for fuel. 

Or say a race of critters with mystic mind-powers who could teleport to other worlds but couldn’t do trigonometry. 

This mostly doesn’t matter to the Fermi Paradox though, because such routes seem improbable enough that odds are even if they maybe do exist somewhere in the Universe they are rare enough not to impact the solution. 

So our example for today is civilizations that go to sleep, and at first, from the groundwork we’ve just laid, this seems as easily dismissed as most other category two concepts. 

If civilizations sleep, what the heck is their motive for doing so? 

And why would all of them do it? 

And we would say there isn’t any and move on, simply saying some might but most wouldn’t and thus it’s not a good Fermi Paradox solution. 

However we recently had a solution provided that does provide a motivation for going to sleep, called Aestivation Hypothesis, which we’ll discuss in a moment. 

It’s not a good Fermi Paradox solution itself - we’ll go ahead and murder it shortly, but it is an interesting approach and got me challenging my assumption about sleeping civilizations in general. 

But first let’s discuss Aestivation Hypothesis. 

It came out in 2017, a year after both the Compendium episode was done and the first Civilizations at the End of time episode, and appropriately the paper by Anders Sandberg and others on this is titled “That is not dead which can eternal lie”, which is a quote from H.P. 

Lovecraft’s Necronomicon, a fictional work mentioned in some of his stories and popularized a lot nowadays. 

The basic assumption is simple enough, a lot of futurists tend to assume that thinking processes will eventually shift from neurons, or whatever an alien might use, over to a computer substrate. 

Don’t confuse that with artificial intelligence, an AI might run on a computer but so can a game of solitaire or your brain. 

The basic reasoning is that whether you are using a physical deck of cards or one on the screen, you are still playing solitaire, and so too, whether your brain runs on neurons or computers as its substrate, it is still a human brain. 

Build a house of stone or brick or wood or LEGO and it still a house, same reasoning, not everyone agrees, but that’s the concept. 

Now a neuron doesn’t work better when you make it cold, it eventually dies and freezes, but computational processes generally do better when it’s colder and we actually have something called Landauer’s Principle which shows the maximum processing a computer can do with a bit of energy is inverse to temperature. 

This adds nothing new to the discussion of the Fermi Paradox and it’s often been suggested civilizations might migrate beyond the galactic rim to where things are cooler to take advantage of that, indeed that was one of miscellaneous solutions we discussed in the compendium. 

Such civilizations are obviously hard for us to see, they’d be tens of thousands of light years away and might be fairly covert. 

They might have ridden out there on suns converted into Shkadov Thrusters and then into Matrioshka Brains, they might be decentralized with each spread out to a small asteroid to help with cooling or even built up into a big centralized Birch Planet, but we’d have problems seeing them now regardless. 

Back in the Civilizations at the End of Time episode, Black Hole Farming, done just a bit after the compendium, we pointed out that while the period after all the stars had died off would be the era of the Universe with the most entropy and the least free energy available, the expanding and cooling Universe would permit computation at such cold temperatures that you might run entire civilizations off what you need to run a light bulb in our time. 

There will be very little energy available, but you can do so much more computing, or thinking and simulating with it. 

The Aestivation Hypothesis – and Aestivation means to hibernate or enter torpor – works on this same reasoning, you put your whole civilization to sleep until temperatures cool down so that you can take advantage of those super cold temperatures and live then, when there’s less free energy but you can do far, far more with it. 

Now that is a great motivation from the Fermi Paradox perspective. 

It is very easy to argue that most civilizations tend to shift to the computer substrate, it’s way more efficient and way better for colonizing space too. 

It also offers simple immortality as you can easily repair and replace everything. 

You can also run your brain faster to experience whole days in mere seconds or slow it down to experience a mere second over a whole century. 

This un-glues you from classic time, and I want to emphasize that because it’s what hit me later on, when I was pondering this more. 

If you live this way you only have two relevant calendars, your internal one of experiences and your civilization around you. 

For the most part, the natural world and Universe are not dominating how you experience time anymore. 

So you can just slow down – I don’t think you’d stop completely, since you’d need to monitor the rest of the Universe – and wait until the Universe cools down to more effectively use your energy. 

It sounds like a solid theory, as everyone should have motivation to do this, and while doing it would appear non-interactive and quiet. 

However as I said we were going to murder it and that’s because it has three big flaws. 

First, the whole point of waiting till the end of time to use your resources is you’ll get vastly more bang for your buck doing so, but that implies you’d like to have a stockpile of resources. 

If you are aiming for hyper-efficiency, you should be resource hoarding and that should result in the same basic Dyson Dilemma we so often discuss. 

Whether you are using every rock and planet and star for resources and power, or simply storing them away, it should look more or less the same. 

A Dark Universe where there are no stars because they waste energy and indeed inhibit processing speed, that’s the very reason you consider migrating to the galactic rim, because galaxies have a lot more heat in them than the intergalactic void on account of all the bright stars illuminating it and all the collisions going on. 

Nor are those resources static, they are getting used up while you wait. 

So by default such a civilization, before it goes to sleep, ought to spread over its galaxy and grab everything to store it securely for the aeons to come, as they’ll actually get to those lower temperatures faster by doing so and ensure more energy and resources to use when that time comes. 

That’s a fatal kill to the Hypothesis right there - we would notice what is effectively a K3 civilization with the lights out. 

But there’s also our second flaw, which is that you have to worry about alien civilizations arising and taking the galaxy while you sleep. 

It does no good to wait to harvest space, if you wake up and find somebody else already has, and even if you had all the resources you want, that doesn’t mean that they do. 

You could leave triggers in place to wake up, or more likely just keep at least some of your civilization awake or just slowed down, but you would have to deal with that new civilization in some way, and even if its a peaceful accord to divide up resources, all those leftover ungathered resources are presumably spawning new civilizations you’d need to wake up and deal with too. 

Then there’s our third, which is exclusivity. 

We don’t know that every species will converge toward this just because it seems logical, and more to the point, we shouldn’t assume every member of a species does. 

That’s just as important for any exclusivity issue with the Fermi Paradox, not just “Will all species do this?” but “Will every piece of their civilization feel the same?”. 

A trillion aliens in an empire who all believe it’s wrong to contact a primitive species might not do so, but it only takes a handful of them, maybe even just one, to send a hello signal or maybe even visit in a ship. 

Similarly, most of a planet’s inhabitants might feel colonizing space is wrong, but if some faction is very expansionist and does so, in a few centuries they won’t be a small minority anymore, but the true new civilization of which the non-expansionists are a tiny minority of antiques. 

So if 99% of a civilization goes to sleep while 1% does not, and instead goes around colonizing, it will be only a millennium or two before that sleeping 99% has become just 1% of some vast new empire, and millions or billions of years later, just some forgotten relic. 

On astronomical timelines any pro-growth section of a civilization will utterly erase no-growth sections of it, all things being equal. 

So on first inspection, the Aestivation Hypothesis seems dead on arrival. 

Indeed, in its default form, it mostly is. 

However, the Lovecraftian title of the paper nagged at my mind, and I started thinking about some of the other Late Filters we’ve discussed. 

Late Filters being solutions to the Fermi Paradox which hit a civilization after they’ve reached our stage, like killing yourself off by artificial intelligence or inventing a brainwashing technique that a unified empire uses to discourage colonization so as to ensure they create no external threats, or a convergence to a hive mind that does the same, never breaking itself up to colonize far away where communication lag time would prevent the extension of that mind and again create potential external threats. 

Let me talk about that galactic harvesting though really quick. 

I say harvest everything now because it gets you maximum energy, but in truth, if you’ve got a civilization with the tech and inclination to use black holes for energy, not all that much is lost by stars burning, and it does take a lot of effort to acquire it all now. 

If you were locked into the idea of having a static population of, say, a billion minds, all kept near at hand to avoid serious mutation from the normal, creating more and sending them out around the galaxy is potentially spawning enemies. 

Over time, those galaxies in the local group bound to us gravitationally will all fall together without losing much mass to radiation and collapse into various black holes. 

You’d still have to go retrieve them or set up shop around them, but as we discussed in Black Hole Farming, in such eras you are already running so slow that while it takes thousands of years for a signal to reach between two such spots, it would seem like real time. 

That epoch is so long that even running at such slow speeds you will experience a total subjective time that makes the entire lifetime of the current Universe seem like an eye blink, so it doesn’t matter to you. 

I pictured thousands of black holes scattered across the remnants of the galaxy, each home to either a civilization or a single supermind slowly experiencing a near eternity but able to speak to each other in what seemed no delay at all. 

Now that doesn’t help with alien civilizations arising and taking the resources, but let’s consider another scenario. 

It’s billions of years ago and they are the first on the galactic scene, these Old Ones. 

Ethics vary and we’ll say they are rather repugnant in that purist and genocidal kind of way, but they firmly believe their civilization is essentially perfect and should tolerate no threats or distorted imitations. 

They know that if they go out and colonize the galaxy those splinter civilizations will likely eventually become every bit as alien as actual aliens. 

You don’t trust anything smart enough, be it one of your own or some AI you’ve made, to go harvest the galaxy and bring it back, so anyone you send out is either dialed down to near-stasis, experiencing virtually no time at all, or too dumb to do much. 

No self-replicating machines or clever members of your species sent out to harvest the stars and decide to keep resources for themselves while they are busy, awake and harvesting and contemplating. 

So you opt to only gather up resources from nearby, to live only nearby, and to mostly sleep until the day comes that you can enjoy the benefits of super-slow, super-cool, ultra-efficient computing, where anyone sent out would be forced to experience time slowly anyway, because it’s the nature of such ultra-cool computing that you actually have to wait a long time between each use of circuit so it can cool back down again on its own. 

Nobody left around is thinking that fast, with a huge energy penalty paid to run hotter, and communication lag time is eliminated by everyone experiencing time slowly. 

Which helps with isolation mutation. 

Yes, you are losing a lot of resources to time marching on and stars burning out or getting ejected from the galaxies, but not that much and if it means you maybe only get a tenth the total resources in the end, but only need a billion people to gather them, you are still ahead of the game, proportionally, by a hundred million fold. 

To them, the Old Ones, it doesn’t matter how many resources their civilization has, but how many each of them individually gets and can use, and having to share with or fend off many others is not beneficial to that cause, because all they really care about is how long, subjectively, they can experience life. 

It doesn’t really matter if this is a billion individuals, or a hive of a billion minds, or a thousand supercomputers, or even just one big one, just so long as all share the motivation of their continued existence for as long as possible as the most important thing, and that any threat to that must be eliminated. 

That’s important because it gives them the motivation to eliminate such threats. 

To kill off any emerging new species elsewhere or to shoot down their own colony ships from deviants seeking to colonize the galaxy. 

They police the galaxy with very stupid probes, ones just smart enough to detect civilizations emerging anywhere in the Local Group of galaxies. 

Then they deal with them. 

There’s many ways to do this, we’ll discuss some in the upcoming Interstellar Warfare episode, but maybe the probe carries a copy of one of their minds forced to sleep, who can only fully awaken when it either gets a go ahead signal from home, or the conditions of that discovered civilization reach a specific marker where if it waits longer it won’t be able to handle them. 

Thus decreasing the risk of a rogue agent doing its own thing. 

Any interstellar-capable vessel could easily wipe us out right as we are now, all on its own, it’s inherent to either the power levels needed for interstellar trips or the automation needed. 

But the key notion is they don’t want that sleeping giant to wake up until the last minute or one drop more than needed because they view it as just as nearly as big a threat as an enemy. 

They don’t want it experiencing, thinking, contemplating, and acting far from home, going native to protect the locals after monitoring them for eons or deciding to set itself up as a new rival civilization. 

So instead of the classic genocide approach of hitting everyone as early as possible, of even colonizing every planet so nothing new and alien can arise there, they have motive to wait until right now. 

Such a probe might not even have a mind, simply making itself easy to find and includes flawed blueprints for a Suicide Pact technology, one that seems an amazing find, like a new power source, but kills your entire civilization if you use it. 

In that way, you ensure all threats, or the need to share the galaxy is eliminated with the minimum risk, and you still keep yourself big enough that you can go wake up and attack them en masse if Plan A fails. 

You are already at the technological limit, you wouldn’t go to sleep until you were pretty confident you figured out every cool and useful bit of science and technology that could help you be more efficient and safe. 

And you probably did gather up a lot of resources too, just not the whole galaxy. 

You might just live in one system, a single Dyson Swarm, or even one planet, though it might be a gigantic Birch Planet made by cannibalizing hundreds of thousands of nearby systems with automated mining. 

So if your preventive measures fail you can still wake up and attack with a giant and super-advanced armada, even if they might have had tens of thousands of years to grow and advance themselves. 

This doesn’t necessarily require a particularly Lovecraft-flavored set of aliens but it does bring to mind, ancient, selfish, sleeping, and cruel ones. 

But it gets around exclusivity by requiring only that they be the first on the scene. 

I wouldn’t qualify it as a strong Fermi Paradox solution, it does not really pass the Dyson Dilemma test for explaining an absence of K3 civilizations in the local Supercluster, just the Local Group, unless such behavior was more the norm than an exception that just arrived on the scene before anyone with a different mindset. 

However, I can’t dismiss it as an implausible one either, this hybrid of Aestivation Hypothesis and the more classic space opera notion of old and cold aliens waking up occasionally to slaughter the galaxy, as with the Reapers from Mass Effect and many other stories. 

That’s what is so potent about Cthulhu Mythos even a century after it was written, not just the classic dangerous sleeping predator hiding in its dark cave and emerging occasionally to hunt us, but that emerging awareness of just how huge and old the Universe is. 

I tend to think that’s why Lovecraft was not very successful as a writer while he lived, but is one of the best known authors nowadays and is to the scifi horror subgenre what Tolkien is to fantasy, or Asimov is to robot-centered scifi. 

We grew up in a world that few saw then, but we know all too well now. 

Robots aren’t a novelty like in Asimov’s time, and the vast age and scope of the Universe, with possible ancient alien civilizations hanging around it, isn’t something that only was really understood by a handful of astronomers and hadn’t sunk into public awareness yet. 

We know how old and big space is, we know that the chemistry for life ought to be fairly common, and we know that the basic evolutionary mechanics of biology should tend to favor species that are fairly pre-disposed to seek to survive and grow their numbers, and their absence, and the Fermi Paradox, worries us. 

I think that Lovecraft was the first writer to really tackle that feeling, and needless to say his writing doesn’t encourage optimism. 

I disagree with that fear his works are best known for but it does absolutely make for a great read, or listen, and has inspired countless authors and novels, from our book of the month a few months back, Alastair Reynolds’ “Revelation Space”, to the master of modern horror, Stephen King, who cites him as his inspiration, and says no one has yet surpassed Lovecraft at tales of dread and horror. 

Of all his works, I’ve picked “At the Mountains of Madness” as our book of the month because it also captures that feeling of exploration too, and we get to see humanity’s brighter side as an expedition challenges themselves reaching out to explore new realms, something we see as a common part of some of the best horror in that time whether it was expeditions exploring the Antarctic or old tombs and pyramids, questing for ancient knowledge. 

There happen to be many versions of the story in abridged, unabridged, and radio drama forms, or in anthologies, one of the nice things about the classics, so I’d recommend searching through them for the narrator you like the most as Audible does let you play a sample of each performance before grabbing it. 

You can pick up a FREE copy of “At the Mountains of Madness” today, just use my link in this episode’s description, Audible.com/Isaac or text promo code isaac to 500-500 to get a free book and 30 day free trial, and that book is yours to keep, whether you stay on with Audible or not. 

I won’t say you are going to love it, as it is horror story charting an expedition to a strange and barren place, but if you don’t enjoy it, you can swap it out for another at any time. 

Next week we’ll be doing our own expedition to a strange and barren place, as we return to our Outward Bound series to look at colonizing Alpha Centauri, and we’ll discuss both interstellar colonization and the special problems of binary and multiple star systems. 

From there, we’ll move back home, to look at how we can go about building up the orbital infrastructure we’ll need to colonize space, and three weeks from now we’ll take another look at space warfare, and consider the special problems with doing that at the interstellar scale. 

And lastly, a month from now we’ll return to the Civilizations at the End of Time series, for Dying Earth, and what civilizations will do when the planet and sun they’ve always depended upon begins to perish.

Spaceports

We spent a lot of time figuring out how to get into orbit, but what do you do and where do you go once you’re up there? 

Welcome back to the Upward Bound series, and I am your host, Isaac Arthur. 

We started this series almost a year ago and have discussed many different ways of getting into space cheaper and safer, and it’s fairly impressive how much launch costs have dropped just in this last year alone. 

We, and lots of other folks, have long predicted there’d be a point where technology dropped launch costs while increasing what we could do up there that would result in a snowball effect and I feel pretty confident at this point saying that I think we are seeing the beginning of that now. 

As it gets cheaper to get off Earth, we also have more things we can do up there, starting up a real economy and infrastructure in orbit, and I thought we’d spend a couple episodes discussing those options. 

For today we will be looking not just at an improved space station to replace the ISS, but a genuine spaceport. 

Designs for those go a long way back, at least to von Braun’s inflatable space wheel, and we started seeing the first realistic ones hit the silver screen in Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke’s class film, “2001: A Space Odyssey”. 

Many more have been dreamed up since, and we have discussed some very large ones we can build down the road, but I was curious what folks had come up with in recent years, tailored to the current and emerging technologies. 

As I investigated those I ran across the Gateway Foundation’s Orbital Assembly Project, and got to talking to one of their engineers, Kit Carson, and their President, John Blincow. 

One of the cool things about running this channel is getting to chat with all the aerospace companies working to bring the future about, and a lot of them tend to be big believers in a lot of the ideas we discuss here, and it is fun to pick their brains and bounce ideas around. 

There are a ton of options for our first spaceport, but it’s easier to focus primarily on one design. 

Since Gateway has a kickstarter coming up for drone assembly robots to be used in orbit, and was kind enough to lend me their top notch animations of some of their designs, I thought we’d use theirs, though I’ll admit, their option to go big for that first spaceport also swayed me. 

Most plans lying around amount to a space station upgrade not much bigger than a house. 

They’re thinking gas station or maybe freeway truck stop, not airport, and a lot of times they’re not including all the ancillary stuff we tend to see near such facilities, convenience stores, motels, hotels, restaurants, entertainment, and so on. 

We’ve discussed a lot of systems that might get launch costs down to under $100 a kilogram, indeed for some just a couple bucks a kilogram, and SpaceX is set to bring that cost down to under $1000 in the very near future with their BFR, a skyscraper-sized rocket. 

$1000 a kilogram has been a fairly common figure to use as the snowball point, probably because it’s about the zone where transporting a person into space is about the same as the GDP per capita in a developed nation, at which point going up to orbit is obviously still a serious luxury, but no longer restricted to billionaires. 

As of today, with nearly sixty years of missions to space, we still haven’t even sent 1000 people up there. 

We have a lot of airports that process that many people through every hour, and even the little airport near me mostly for recreational flying does that many in a week. 

If we want to be able to say we have a genuine foothold in space, we need to be thinking about spaceports that can welcome a thousand people a week. 

It’s worth noting that even at that rate, that’s only about 50,000 people a year, while still being nearly a hundred times as many folks as we’ve ever sent up there so far. 

50,000 a year would mean only a million people out of each generation of humanity got to go into space just one time. 

If we wanted everybody to get a chance to spend a week up there it would mean sending not 50,000 people a year, but 100 Million. 

That’s three people every second, rather than about every month as now. 

Needless to say, that’s a long way off, but if launch costs drop to the point where a person, and little bit of luggage and supplies, call it 200 kilograms a person, could be sent there for $1000 a kilogram, or $200,000 each, ten billion dollars would provide 50,000 people access to space. 

That’s actually a very plausible annual figure for tourism alone, and there are a lot more than 50,000 folks who could afford that ticket. 

More to the point, it starts opening options for private sector spending we tend not to think about. 

If you want to rent out the Vomit Comet for a flight, it cost about as much as one of those tickets we just mentioned, and that gets a film crew a couple dozen zero-gravity intervals of about half a minute, spread over a few hours of flight. 

Not really ideal filming circumstances, alternatively a spaceport could easily have several bays just given over to filming, where a cast and crew of 50 could spend weeks shooting up there unrushed for a price tag of around ten million, a sizable but hardly murderous cost for a big-budget film. 

That’s also a pretty good draw for other folks and publicity, since a lot of folks would enjoy getting to meet celebrities up there filming or get cast as an extra in a film, since it makes sense to grab those from folks already up there, and I’m sure you’d have a lot of video blogging going on by those celebrities while they were up there too. 

That’s just one example of something that has nothing to do with science that you could use a spaceport for in the near future. 

If we want others, we really only need to consider what we tend to find at more conventional transportation ports. 

Hotels, restaurants, and casinos would be some examples. 

I was joking with John and Kit that someone might make a fortune patenting the first zero-gravity roulette wheel or magnetic table and dice for gaming. 

And for the same reason lavish charity gambling or dinner events tend to do well, these probably would too, since those doing it can point out that they are helping fund a good cause. 

That was actually one of John’s more interesting ideas for funding too, a lottery where the winner gets an all-expense paid trip to the spaceport. 

Launch costs may be getting a lot cheaper, but we’d still be talking tickets priced at a decent fraction of a million bucks, which is more than most of us will ever have to spend. 

But if you can buy a ticket, like with most state lotteries where a big chunk goes to education or similar, you’ve got a plausible shot at winning and know all that money is either going to fund making it cheaper and better or sending someone up there. 

Don’t think of this as a small additional source of potential funding either, lotteries alone bring in over 70 billion dollars a year in the US, about double America’s total space program spending, not just NASA, and 300 billion globally, about 5 times what the whole planet spends on space programs. 

It would let us get a lot more science done, to the point where Universities can afford to send a scientist or two up there for months, and rent out a lab all to themselves. 

Right now it can take years just to get a small box up there that an astronaut might tinker with for a few minutes a day for you, this is not ideal for a lot of experiments. 

The thing is a spaceport that can handle several hundred people on board at once is not a small thing, and proportionally even bigger than the ISS because folks will want more elbow room. 

The Gateway Spaceport design is modular, designed to be built in chunks and mostly automatically, and also expandable, and begin with the Gateway Segment Assembly Line or GSAL. 

The GSAL is an automated assembly system designed to create segments of a structure. 

The segments are then welded together to form the whole structure. 

This method of construction is called permanent modular construction. 

The GSAL will consist of a number of workstations, each with a different assignment. 

Each will assemble semi complete segments much like aircraft manufacturers and shipyards do. 

You ship up the raw materials and it takes them in and spits out segments, like trusses. 

An interesting advantage of space construction is your trusses don’t have to be all that massive, as there’s no gravity to fight. 

You construct modularly, in blocks. 

The GSAL makes square sections for the station hub or wedge segments for the ring sections. 

Beams go into the GSAL and modules come out to be welded into place. 

They estimate each block would take just under half an hour to make. 

The GSAL itself is roughly 12 by 12 by 120 meters and the modules themselves can be a maximum 7.6 meters wide and tall or 25 feet, and can actually be of any length but the default construction of the Spaceport Hub called for a length of 76 meters or 250 feet. 

You can make segments skinnier, shorter, longer, or have them vary in width so as to produce wedge shaped sections for a ring. 

Each one of these, using the default length for the Spaceport Hub sections would be 7.6 by 7.6 by 76 meters with a volume of 4400 cubic meters, almost five times the pressurized volume of the International Space Station, at just 916 cubic meters. 

The Gateway Hub section is a disc with a large rectangular docking bay cut into it, composed of a couple of hundred of these modules. 

Its own pressurized volume is 1.1 million cubic meters, fully 1200 times that of the ISS. 

And that’s pretty darn big, true, but it’s peanuts compared to some of the structures we talk about, even the modest ones like an O’Neill Cylinder, but it would dwarf every object we’ve sent into space so far combined. 

Now, with a radius and depth of 76 meters, and 1.4 million cubic meters of volume, both the pressurized section and vacuum-exposed bay, you could stop here and have a very complete and useful spaceport. 

There’s plenty of room for ships in that bay too, it’s a good deal larger than a football field and it is designed to operate stand-alone from additional segments. 

Of course as big as it is, we will want to add some components on to the Hub. 

Now by default a space station has no gravity, and as we’ve discussed before you can simulate gravity by spinning the object. 

How fast you spin it and how far you are from the center of spin, controls the apparent gravity inside. 

This apparent gravity is linear to the radius or diameter, so if you double the ring size you’d double the apparent gravity, alternatively if you climb halfway toward the middle you would halve the gravity and it would be zero at the center. 

This is not the case for the speed the object is spinning at though. 

You can calculate this either as the tangential velocity, the specific speed the outside edge is spinning at, in which case apparent gravity rises with the square, or with its angular velocity, the rate at which it is rotating. 

As an example the Earth spins at the equator at about 460 meters per second, its tangential velocity, while it spins one revolution per day, its angular velocity. 

RPMs or revolutions per minute tends to be the default value spin-gravity stations are given in and it also causes a rise in spin-gravity with the square of angular velocity. 

Hypothetically you can simulate any level of gravity this way but it puts a huge strain on the station to hold together the larger you make it and the faster you spin it. 

On top of this, people don’t handle being spun around rapidly in circles too well, it makes us nauseous and disoriented. 

It’s generally accepted that anything less than 2 RPM won’t bother people, and we’ve some indications that with training we could get used to a good deal more. 

Now one of the reasons we don’t have such a spinning section on the ISS is that we’ve got plenty of places to do gravity-based experiments but just that one small station for zero-gravity, plus the place is small enough that any rotating section would either have very little gravity or be nausea-inducing. 

The Gateway Spaceport aims for something much larger, multiple rings with much larger diameters spinning will be slower. 

The first to be built and innermost of these would be the Lunar Gravity Area or LGA, with a radius of 152 meters, by rotating once per minute it would generate 17% of normal gravity, the same as on the Moon. 

Needless to say this would be handy for folks training for moon missions which is why that was selected, for a Mars Gravity Area, a ring with a larger radius would simulate Martian gravity, or lower, to simulate a place like Jupiter’s moon Callisto, which has only 13% Earth gravity and as we discussed in the Outward Bound series, is one of the best potential first bases for humanity out past the Asteroid Belt. 

However, besides training its real advantage is allowing us to do long term studies of the effects of low gravity on people. 

We actually have no idea what that is, the twelve folks who have ever experienced low gravity only experienced the Moon’s specific value and only for a few days. 

For all we know, even the Moon’s small surface gravity might be entirely enough for healthy people to live years at a time, or it could be that even Venus’s near-Earth gravity isn’t enough. 

Best to find out in orbit, now, not in the middle of a mission millions of kilometers from help. 

This is important too, as for instance we have no idea how much gravity is needed to safely carry an infant to term, and we’ve good cause to think that is a gravitationally sensitive process. 

You’ve got serious issues colonizing other planets if you can’t, well, manufacture colonists in-situ. 

And if there are any complications in pregnancies from gravity, it behooves us to identify them on some large and well-equipped space station close enough to Earth for real-time communication, not on some cramped moon base or Martian colony. 

So the LGA lets us investigate the long term effects of lunar gravity and train and prep crews for missions to the Moon. 

It also allows folks to enjoy the fun of low gravity while still having the intuitive sense of up and down work. 

The plans call for 300 guest rooms, which would have the advantage of allowing you to sleep without needing to strap in and drink from normal cups rather than bulbs and avoid the unpleasantness involved with using the restroom in zero-gravity. 

I suspect a lot of folks would want to try out the full zero-gravity experience but after a day or so might be glad to have a room with some gravity in it. 

And the LGA has plenty of rooms in it. 

At 3.2 million cubic meters of volume, it would be 3400 times as spacious as the International Space Station. 

The next ring to be built would be the MGA – Mars Gravity Area. 

With a radius of 244 meters it would only simulate 27% gravity at 1 RPM, Mars is actually at 38% so we would have to adjust spin to 1.18 RPM, again well beneath the 2 RPM value we think is safe against disorientation. 

Spun to 1.9 RPM it would match normal Earth gravity and a bit less could simulate Venus. 

At 30 meters width, which would be several floors or decks, and 45 meters depth, the LGA itself would have a volume of 2.2 million cubic meters, about 2400 times the volume of the ISS. 

It would also include 46 Megawatts of solar power generation. 

This ring is expected to house about a thousand people spread over 550 guest cabins and is viewed as more of a long-term residence area, a mission to Mars calls for 18 months on the ground in Martian gravity so we need long term tests to begin with, so it is anticipated this area would also include apartments or facilities for rent or lease. 

Probably fairly expensive, after all even if you are only including launch costs for supplies and totally recycling air and water, supplies for one person for a year might easily still run a million dollars, but that is viable for crew or long term researchers or folks who are quite wealthy and simply want to live in space. 

Space in space is actually fairly cheap and made cheaper by the square-cube law, as we’ve discussed with larger spaceships, if you simply double something in size its surface area rises by the square, or 4, but its volume rises with the cube, or 8. 

You need 4 times the shielding and hull material, but you get 8 times the space inside it, or need only half the shielding per unit of space. 

As mentioned the Hub is over a thousand times bigger than ISS, in volume, so essentially it only needs about a tenth the shielding material per unit of space as ISS does. 

You wouldn’t want to be lavish with room design but your bottleneck is on the mass of furniture and equipment in a room more than the size of the room. 

You could have a couple thousand people living, working, or visiting the full Gateway Spaceport at any given time with shuttles carrying 30-40 people arriving and departing several times a day. 

And that’s just the default size of the station, you could make it skinnier or wider, the GSAL is basically printing those modules like pasta, you can cut the module noodle at any length. 

You could also build a whole other spaceport instead if you need room, in a different orbit or right next door and connect them. 

Now a big aspect of construction is going to be drones, and you basically have two types, the flying kind and the crawling kind. 

The latter zip around welding things, welding in a vacuum is tricky but we’ve had some practice, and the other kind mostly zips around grabbing things, we really don’t want tools or construction material wandering off, both for the loss of material and because a hammer that seems to spin away at a meter or two a second is still actually moving several thousand meters per second relative to Earth and could eventually smash into something on a different orbital path with a huge amount of force. 

Indeed, next time in this series we’ll be examining how that can cause a runaway effect, where objects get destroyed, their debris scatters and destroys more things, and so on, littering orbital space with millions of hyper-velocity bullets and potentially preventing any space travel. 

This is known as Kessler Syndrome and we will discuss it in more detail, along with ways of handling it, in the next episode of the series in a few weeks. 

Those drones could be controlled by station operators but in fact, seeing as how the station is only hundreds of kilometers up, ground-based pilots could control them, saving a lot of money. 

Indeed if our robotics get good enough you could use humanoid shaped robots like NASAs Robonaut piloted by folks in virtual reality down on Earth, potentially allowing a much bigger crew who also don’t need living space or time off, as the next shift just takes over the robot. 

For manned construction we have something usually called a pod, which is basically a small pressurized vehicle, though the person inside would likely wear a suit anyway, with various jets to move it around and arms to manipulate equipment and tools, and of course we’d have classic spacesuits for EVA too. 

Spacesuits remain a problem as they are bulky and leak, and more the higher the pressure, hence why we tend to use oxygen-only in spacesuits and have to have the astronauts pre-breathe to purge nitrogen from their blood. 

One of the preferred ways to deal with this is a rubberized suit that would push on the wearer but we have problems at the neck and helmet interface, partially because while you can squeeze a body fairly hard, you can’t really squeeze someone’s neck that much, as it tends to make them pass out and die. 

Hence pods and drones are going to be preferable and our technology there is rapidly improving. 

The thing about a spaceport of this size is it allows you to have a crew big enough for lots of specialization and redundancy while also allowing lots of folks who have nothing to do with spaceport operations, including crewmembers just there to monitor those visitors or residents so they don’t kill themselves on accident, and provide hospitality of course. 

You could easily have small teams from dozens of universities or government labs conducting experiments up there while movie crews film and travelers come by just to enjoy zero-gravity and all the various associated entertainments we could come up with, like a zero-g racquetball court or casino. 

And since it does have gravity in segments, you’ve got places for people to go if that lack of gravity gets overwhelming. 

Since you’d doubtless be screening everyone medically before they went up and when they got home, you would also build a very large data pool on health effects of no gravity and low gravity. 

You’ve got room for entire hydroponic gardens for botanists to work with to do large samples of many plants and see how low or no gravity affects them, instead of just small terrariums like we are limited to now. 

We can also do some zoology too, we haven’t taken that many animals to space, especially large ones, or done much research on how groups of them behave in the long term, what changes to hunting or breeding might occur in low gravity. 

How would a flying squirrel act in a forested dome with lunar gravity? 

Folks heading off to a moon base will have had time to get used to the gravity and will know there’s a platform with ships docked to it and fuel that could resupply them rapidly, no weather-fickle ground-based launch windows, and come get them in an emergency. 

We can train Mars crews safely for simulated 26 month missions, part in no gravity and part in Martian, and see for sure if they can handle it before sending them off where we can’t help. 

Asteroid mining companies could know they’ve got a place to dock and unload, refuel, repair, and get some relaxation before heading off again. 

You could have repair bays so that potentially a satellite could be repaired, or even assembled from parts, right there rather than needing to design it for fitting in one rocket payload and eventually being pushed up to a graveyard orbit or down to burn up. 

If your 3D printing is good enough you could manufacture replacement parts or upgrades right there, and if your robots are versatile enough, the work could be done there with them piloted by expert technicians who are groundside controlling the robots. 

Once you build your initial space construction infrastructure, you could start assembling truly huge space-based telescopes too, remember Hubble is pretty big but there are many ground-based ones that are larger, and you can actually make bigger ones in space. 

Tons of options, and more will emerge after such a spaceport is created too. 

If you build it, they will come. 

And once the hub is overloaded you build the LGA segments, then the MGA, then you can add on more independent modules attached to it or a whole new station connected to it or serving a different orbital path. 

The Gateway Foundation’s spaceport design is not the only one, but it especially impressed me as did their work on drones, which we will be looking at more next time in the series. 

More so because it’s not a design for just one series, but a setup designed to able to continue perpetual construction of new ones so we can accommodate more and more people and keep dropping the price tag to go up there, until eventually the available space rises and the costs drops so that anyone can go. 

They do have a Kickstarter just opening up for the drone design and I will attach a link in the video description if you want to read more and support them, and I know they are also looking for crew members, and volunteers to help out on the graphics side, much like us here at SFIA, where I am also always looking for folks with some computer graphics skills and time to volunteer them, those animations are not core to the technological development but they are vital to explaining these concepts to folks and helping gathering interest, enthusiasm, and of course funding. 

And again if you wanted to help them out in either way, I’ll leave the link below, and hopefully we’ll get some good space drones out of it in the near future, which will be vital to infrastructure in space. 

And at this point, with even just the completed Hub of the spaceport, you do have the beginnings of a basic orbital infrastructure and the perfect beachhead to expand that. 

We will be looking at orbital infrastructure, more on orbital construction, and as mentioned, orbital debris and Kessler Syndrome in three weeks. 

Before that we will be heading back to the Fermi Paradox series to examine the concept of ancient hibernating civilizations in Fermi Paradox Sleeping Giants, and then we will launch off to Alpha Centauri to discuss colonizing the system and look at the special difficulties of binary and multiple star systems.

Mars: From Science Fiction to Science Fact
---
  
2018-02-01  
https://youtu.be/S0dqd72ALkQ  

---

Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore. 

So today we will be looking at some of the missions being contemplated to get us to Mars. 

This is a two part episode with Paul Shillito of Curious Droid who is covering the earlier history of such mission planning. 

If you haven’t already seen Part 1, take the link over to there and we’ll see you in a bit. 

If you are arriving here from there for the first time, welcome, and you might want to turn the captions on and grab a drink and snack. 

So after the Space Race had essentially wrapped up we saw quite a fall off not just in mission to Mars, but interest in heading there next. 

Between 1960 and 1975 over 50 Mars missions were attempted between the US and Soviet Union, of which only about a quarter were totally successful while most of them were total failures. 

This might explain why for the next fifteen years only two missions were attempted. 

Nobody had gone back to the Moon during that time either and one can argue Mars lost focus in favor of wanting to master the moon first. 

However even science fiction mostly abandoned Mars in the 1980s; not a single major film came out about Mars in the 80s until Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared in Total Recall, set on Mars, in 1990. 

Nor were there many books on the topic either, and Kim Stanley Robinson’s 90s book trilogy on Colonizing Mars captured a lot of people’s curiosity as it gave a detailed and scientific look at traveling to, colonizing, and settling Mars. 

This changed toward the end of the 1990s but we see this huge gap of lost interest in the 1980s between the Space Race Era and renewed modern interest, and Paul and I felt it was a natural place to break things. 

In this renewed interest we saw Dr. Robert Zubrin’s Case for Mars published in 1996, laying out the foundations for the Mars Direct program which we’ll touch on more shortly, but it was the Pathfinder Mission that I’d say truly sparked folks interest in Mars again. 

I was 16 at the time, and for a lot of us in that age range Pathfinder was almost our Apollo Landing. 

Of course it was a robot, not a person, so we wanted to see a person there. 

And for many of us that is what brought us to read scientifically detailed works of fiction like Robinson’s Mars Trilogy or Zubrin’s very non-fictional and absolutely inspiring Case for Mars. 

I don’t know if Robinson will ever see this but Robert probably will and he does visit the SFIA Facebook forum occasionally so on behalf of myself and many others, let me thank him for laying out a path to an achievable series of missions and bases on Mars. 

Pathfinder certainly sparked renewed public interest in that, and we saw a veritable truckload of films set on Mars after that, but for me and many others that made it a thing for the future, not just scifi. 

So we’ll start there with Mars Direct. 

In point of fact, while the book hit in 1996, the plan dates back to 1990 and has been evolving and updating ever since, with the founding of the Mars Society in 1998 and an updated edition of the Case for Mars in 2011. 

At the time a lot of Manned Mars missions had focused on using nuclear-powered ships to get there, an option Paul and I have each discussed in his Project Orion episode and my “the Nuclear Option” episode. 

One can argue this was part of the problem too, as treaties severely limited atomic rockets and such ships needed to be large, assembled in space, and would need shielding both from cosmic radiation without and reactor radiation within. 

Zubrin argues this was the wrong approach and that we should aim for multiple missions, the first an unmanned one, called an ERV or Earth Return Vehicle, carrying a small nuclear reactor and a supply of hydrogen to land on Mars and process local carbon dioxide with that hydrogen you brought along to make methane and oxygen to use for fuel on the return trip, producing that fuel in situ. 

This concept has been, in variations, a staple of a lot of Mars Mission concepts. 

It doesn’t take much more fuel to get to Mars than it does the Moon, and indeed the lion’s share is consumed just getting into Low Earth Orbit, but it takes a ton to come home and far more if you are carrying it with you since you need more fuel to push the return voyage fuel. 

That step is simply mission 1 of a series, and essentially an unmanned proof of concept. 

The second launch would follow 26 months later, optimal launch windows for Mars occur every 26 months, and would be two launches, another ERV and a MHU, Mars Habitat Unit, a 4-astronaut manned mission taking 6 months to travel there. 

Subsequent missions would use the same double launch, sending the ERV to make their return fuel and sending the MHU to do the manned mission. 

This second ERV is essentially a backup, if something went wrong with the first, or a replacement to be used for the next mission. 

Now six months is a long time to spend in space so that Habitation Unit included artificial gravity created by spinning the module on a tether and of course you’ve got radiation issues too, something we’ll see arising as a concern in a lot of designs. 

After a six month trip, they spend a year and a half there and return at mission month 24, windows home from Mars are also 26 months apart but trail Earth’s window by 24 months, or predate it by two months if you prefer. 

They’d leave all the gear behind except the ERV, the original or the replacement, for the next follow up mission which will launch from Earth just two months after they’ve launched from Mars, and will get to Mars just a little after they arrive home. 

Now this does make for missions of about two and half years duration, and also means that while you are sending constant missions, you’ve got an 8 month window in each 26-month cycle where nobody is there doing anything including inspecting and maintaining the equipment. 

If you wanted to leave someone there you’d need to have some of the crew stick around for an extra 26 months and two and half years is already very hard on the mind and body. 

That mind part is as important as body. 

We just recently finished up the twin experiments with Scott Kelly which will hopefully add to ability to treat the physical health issues in space, but the mental ones are just as big a concern. 

Kelly spent 13 months in space, the US record, not even half that mission time, and Valeri Polyakov still holds the record at almost 15 months. 

Their combined stays would still be shorter than a single Mars mission. 

Dr. Polyakov, whose field is space medicine, was an obvious choice for that study back in 1994, and since he is turning 76 in a couple months it provides a good indicator that even long term space missions can be performed without shortening lifespan significantly. 

Of course they could talk to mission control and their friends and family real time, and again they were up there for only half the time a Mars Mission would last. 

The stress of longer missions is likely to rise even more, and any number of suggestions have been made for dealing with this. 

Initially we figured on all male crews but others suggested mixed crew later on, or all female ones, or even married couples. 

That last always seems rather popular but has struck me as dubious, you obviously wouldn’t send a couple who already had young kids, they might be a bit old by the time they were grown up, and since the whole notion is that a married couple is stable, ones who probably haven’t been married long enough for kids would seem a non-ideal test case. 

I’m also reminded of the example from Robert Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land, where they had that policy so a single candidate otherwise high on the list illicitly got a copy of other such candidates and flew down to propose to one the next day. 

This is kind of amusing because it might be an ideal case, since the folks involved are clearly very dedicated to the mission if they’d fake a marriage that it might make them perfect picks, and to be fair a shared passion of that magnitude is the basis for a lot of successful relationships too. 

But this brings up an example of evolving technology. 

We had the nuclear-powered ERV to make fuel from hydrogen we brought along but some newer designers skip that entirely in favor of using solar panels for power and native Martian Water Ice for the hydrogen. 

In a similar mindset, we’ve been experimenting with stasis, essentially putting people into light hibernation, for space voyages in recent years, and we also have emerging technology like virtual reality to provide entertainment and stress relief. 

Back in Heinlein’s day any entertainment would be physical books or films, and maybe radio or TV arriving from home. 

Nowadays one could easily include copies of every book, film and TV show mankind has ever produced and barely make a dent in the ship’s cargo allowance, and ultra-high bandwidth lasers could easily send updates, albeit delayed. 

That time lag is a big deal though, not just for help from mission control but because it means no live conversations except for those folks with you. 

In an orbital base, or even a moonbase, you can chat with your family on phone or TV, or even VR goggles soon enough, and mission control is right there for help and if something goes wrong you’re home in days at most. 

As we move into some other Mars Plans, I want to stress that this tends to be my biggest criticism of many of them. 

All the rocketry and fuel and air aspects are important but for manned missions not one drop more important than the physiological and psychological ones. 

Early indications are we can probably find folks who can handle 30 month missions but we wouldn’t be able to say for sure till we either do it or build a prison-bunker we can stick candidates in for 30 months with intercoms that delay every message twenty minutes. 

I’m pretty sure that would qualify under some definitions of torture and would still lack the stress of the real deal, since those in the bunker will know we can rush in to save them and there’d be no obvious threats anyway. 

Folks who remember the 90s probably also remember the Biosphere 2 mission, which while hardly up to NASA standards was also a very well-funded effort that did not turn out well, and since we knew we’d need to get pretty good with such enclosed habitat technology to do any serious Moon or Mars bases it added to that impression Mars was going to be very hard. 

We often talk about using plants to recycle air and water and produce some food but the challenge of that and the additional mission and payload requirements to do it has seen it absent from almost all first mission designs. 

It’s a lot of mass though, just the food alone for a 4 man mission for three years masses in at about 10 tons. 

On ISS levels of water consumption, about 4 tons per person per year, that’s about 60 tons of water they’d need, and that’s a lot of mass, more than the space shuttle weighed. 

Needless to say we’d like to recycle that, but it’s always worth keeping in mind that all that equipment requires mass and space and maintenance itself. 

Not to mention energy, the amount of light needed to comfortably light a room and the amount outside on a sunny day are nothing alike. 

Our eyes are logarithmic in their sensitivity, so a room can seem brightly lit to us when it is receiving not even a percent of the illumination it would if you pulled the roof off at noon. 

It’s rather awkward, not to mention dangerous, to put lots of windows on a spaceship so you’d probably have to supply it electrically. 

Of course most of your mission time is down on Mars and windows are safer there and there is enough light, but glass or plastic sturdy enough to handle the pressure difference isn’t exactly light and one has to ask if a given square meter of dome glass, by weight, is going to produce as much food, water, and air in a year to pay for its mass. 

Or really just food because there is ice on Mars and while melting that for water and electrolyzing it for oxygen, or extracting oxygen from carbon dioxide in Mars’s atmosphere, takes a lot of energy, or a hefty amount of solar panels, but its less than such domes would presumably weigh. 

Add to that, you do need to bring nitrogen along for those plants, which doesn’t actually mass that much but it also means you need to use a higher pressure in everything. 

Humans don’t need the typical 1 atmosphere air pressure so much as they need the regular oxygen density, so we can go low pressure which is very handy for spacesuits, everything leaks and the lower the pressure inside the lower that leakage. 

All in all, while the advantages of recycling air and water while supplying some fresh food are immense, it’s often seen as more trouble than it’s worth. 

That’s why many Mars base illustrations lack the characteristic domes we so often picture with space colonization. 

However this notion of being able to recycle stuff to cut down on mass you need to bring along is not the only path, and we often talk about what is called ‘in-situ’ resources, things you can get at the destination. 

We see an example of that with Mars Direct, where we made fuel for the return trip there. 

Such ideas are also incorporated into DevelopSpace’s 2008 presentation, “Minimalist Human Mars Mission”. 

As an example the zirconia electrolysis process used for extracting oxygen from carbon dioxide produces carbon monoxide exhaust. 

They suggest we could take that exhaust and synthesize ethylene and from that make plastic for domes or tents. 

This is particularly of note since if you can make plastic from local materials you can also potentially provide it as a feedstock for 3D printers, a technology with a lot of promise for space missions that potentially simplifies a lot of problems even if you have to bring your printing material with you. 

Of course one of the biggest problems with Mars missions isn’t getting there it is getting back, you either need to bring a lot more fuel along or make it there. 

However, when we’re discussing missions lasting a few years, and likely including at least a few years devoted to applying for the job and training for it, some might ask if the fuel or equipment for making fuel is even worth bringing along. 

Maybe you’re not spending years on a mission but the rest of your lifetime, and that cargo space can be devoted to making permanent facilities on Mars. 

That was one of the key notions of the Mars One project announced earlier this decade. 

You send a 4 person crew there and they don’t come home, they are just joined after the next launch window by another crew, and another and larger ones till you have a colony. 

Mars One was pretty controversial, and for good reasons, but they deserve mention as probably the first serious and well-known privately funded mission design. 

And whatever else comes from it, they did get people seriously talking about Mars again, which hadn’t faded from sight as long or much as in the 1980s but had started losing ground and public interest for a time. 

Likely at least in part from the bad global economy, it’s obviously hard to get funding for space exploration when money is tight. 

They had a novel approach on funding too, as much as most of us jeer at Reality TV shows, they are quite popular and also a good way of keeping the public interested in the mission. 

Space missions are ridiculously expensive, and a serious space program is a cost even most countries can’t realistically afford, so private funding of something so far-reaching as a Mars Mission requires some fairly inventive methods of raising capital. 

Now Mars One has a lot of flaws though at the same time probably gets more criticism than it deserves too, personally I don’t think there’s anything wrong with using Reality TV to keep up funding and public interest or recruiting from all over rather than from existing astronaut candidates. 

If I can get a mission funded by slapping sponsor logos on the rocket, that’s fine by me. 

However their suggested price tag of just 6 billion dollars was always dubious at best and the technical issues raised were rarely well-rebutted, I suspect the mission would have ended with crews using those life support capsules as coffins. 

That always an issue with missions like this, it would be quite easy to sell the US congress a Mars Mission for 100 billion dollars if you could tell them you were 99% confident the crew would come home alive and safe and not fall over dead a year later from all the health complications of low gravity and radiation. 

However if they think there’s more than an outside chance of critical mission failure they know they may have just cut a check for a particularly expensive and elaborate form of political suicide. 

People can talk all they want about the need to take risks but we still tend to be very harsh on those who took them if it doesn’t pan out. 

I’m quite sure this is part of the reason robots have become more popular than manned missions, though of course cost helps, but a lot less heads roll when your robotic rover crashes into Mars than when your manned capsule does. 

Manned or robotic it still takes a lot of money so of course a lot of ideas have focused around an international expedition rather than one funded by a single country. 

There’s a lot to be said about competition, I doubt the US and USSR would have achieved so many amazing successes in the Space Race if they hadn’t be striving to one up each other, but cooperation and teamwork are certainly handy too and of course so is being able to split the check, and it has worked pretty well so far for the International Space Station. 

That was a fairly a large component in Shaun Moss’s 2015 book “The International Mars Research Station”, which incorporated a lot of prior architecture and modern technological improvements into the plan. 

Though I should note for the sake of honesty Shaun is a friend and I helped proofread the book, so I’m probably not neutral on it. 

A big focus there was on the SpaceX Falcon and Dragon designs and the ability of those to land 30 tons on Mars. 

Particularly the Red Dragon which would let you do a pinpoint landing on Mars with a crew of six. 

That worked very well in conjunction with the Bigelow BA 330, sometimes called the Nautilus which is a reworking of NASA’s TransHab design from the 90’s. 

Essentially an expandable or inflatable ship or base, so you could pack it on a conventional rocket and expand it later. 

A point he focuses on and which has been raised a lot for space missions is how incredibly bulky, leaky, and cumbersome space suits are and some of the efforts being made to produce new designs like MIT’s Biosuit. 

This gets skipped a lot in discussion of space exploration and colonization but is an important aspect and serious problem. 

One of the advantages of manned missions is you have a clever and dexterous human on hand, not a clumsy stupid robot. 

If you’ve seen many spacewalks you know that being in a suit doesn’t make one very nimble. 

We are severely limited in missions in space, on the Moon, or Mars or any hazardous environment by our astronauts needing tons of time to put on a suit that leaves them less agile than a lot of modern robots. 

One might wonder what 4 or 6 people might do on Mars for a mission over a year long, one cannot spend that whole time collecting rocks, but the simple bulkiness of those suits makes collecting samples or doing anything else a lot more time consuming than one might expect. 

We’ve skipped a lot of mission designs and only skimmed the details to get to modern times and the newest big plan, which of course is Elon Musk’s BFR project. 

Since this is a family friendly channel we will assume that is short for Big Falcon Rocket, and of course we’ve got the usual criticisms Musk tends to get for thinking a little bit too big. 

That may be a valid criticism but is certainly not one I am in any position to level, it’s barely been a month since we were discussing how to move galaxies on this channel. 

A lot of talk has been had about being able to land reusable rockets on the ground and how valuable this is and if it really is all that valuable as opposed to just using parachutes or landing in the water, but it is pretty important and handy if your landing spot is Mars, not Cape Canaveral. 

More to the point, we’ve seen a huge drop in launch costs in recent years, and when you half the launch cost per kilogram you can double the cargo you land on Mars, or double the crew. 

The loose idea is that the BFR gets to orbit, refuels from other vehicles there, and launches to Mars. 

Not carrying a crew of 4 or maybe 6 but potentially a couple hundred. 

This is not planned as a one-way trip but it also isn’t planned to leave material behind to sit around dead on Mars or awaiting a new crew from the next mission. 

Rather it aims to establish a permanent presence and keep expanding, and that’s a lot more realistic when you have hundreds of hands to work on projects. 

It also lets you get around the timelag issue. 

In orbit, or even on the moon, you can talk to experts real time, you can’t on Mars, so ideally you want to bring a crew big enough to understand everything in a fairly in-depth way, just consulting home rather than being utterly dependent on them for anything that goes off script. 

I am not sure if any of these missions will ever get off the ground, but they are all a step in the right direction, with the big approach my pick for the right path. 

It’s been almost half a century since we went to the Moon for the first time and nearly as long since the last time, and while that can make folks pessimistic about each new proposed mission it’s easy to forget the huge leaps we’ve made since then and are continuing to make. 

3D Printing will allow us to make specialized tools and equipment on Mars instead of needing to pack every widget we need or go without. 

Improvement in the weight, endurance, and efficiency of solar panels, batteries, and fuel cells will let us run missions without having to either bring along cumbersome and dangerous small nuclear reactors or otherwise be energy-starved and limited while we do it. 

Drops in launch costs will let us send far larger missions for far lower price tags. 

We are getting there, and again I do think Musk’s mindset of going big is the right one, though I’m sure that won’t surprise any channel regulars. 

I can’t say I’m super optimistic about his 2022 or 2024 mission dates, but I don’t think we’re too far off from the point where all the technological improvements across the board will mix with growing public enthusiasm for this to snowball into a mission. 

We’ve come a long way since the projects Paul discussed in Part 1, and we have a ways yet to still go, but I believe making this dream reality is in sight. 

So we’ve just finished a wide ranging discussion on the history of plans for space colonization and touched on everything from the political will needed for a successful mission to the logistical uncertainties of supporting a crew on another planet. 

In particular, we questioned what mix of transported and acquired resources would be best to minimize costs without sacrificing the viability of the mission. 

For any such in-situ resource harvesting, crews will need to have dependable ways to scour alien planets for subterranean deposits like ice or methane. 

A planet’s gravitational field is often approximated, for the sake of convenience, to be uniform in all locations, but in reality, it depends on the local structure of the planet. 

In particular, local increases or decreases in the average density, due to resource deposits, give telltale signatures in readings of the gravitational field. 

If you like, you can rest easy with the knowledge that this is possible, but then you’ll never be able to colonize the Solar System. 

Our sponsor for this collaboration, Brilliant.org helps you build the toolset that will require. 

In fact, they’ve built a lesson just for this purpose, how to detect subterranean deposits using a gravimeter, a field device that allows sensitive measurement of gravity on the go.

De-Extinction: Resurrecting the Past

2018-01-25  
https://youtu.be/H581aDWa0ic

They say over 99% of species which have ever existed have gone extinct, what if we could bring them all back? 

We spend a lot of time on the channel talking about the future of humanity and colonizing and terraforming new worlds or even constructing them from scratch. 

We generally do not spend too much time on ecology though. 

We spent some time talking about energy requirements for growing food for people but not so much the ecological angles, as I am a physicist not an ecologist. 

Our main topic for today is how to resurrect extinct species, and an important aspect of that is where you are going to put them all. 

Most species did not go extinct in a vacuum, typically something else came in that either took over their ecological niche or radically altered it so they could no longer survive. 

By and large you can’t just re-introduce some extinct species into our own modern environment, as they will either die off again or possibly make something else go extinct, and since virtually every species that ever existed has died off, there’s really not room to resurrect them all here on Earth. 

Hence, we need to be thinking about where else to put them. 

We’ve got two basic approaches, single species recreation in a zoo environment or reproducing the entire ecosystem. 

Recreating some critter means it needs something to eat, ideally whatever it used to eat, but a T-Rex probably can eat cow just fine. 

Some species are more adaptable than others. 

Humans are one of the most adaptable species, so you don’t need to recreate sub-saharan Africa from a few million years back in order to recreate humans from that period. 

On the other hand, some species are much more specialized and highly dependent on their original ecosystem. 

Generally speaking, the ones that went extinct did so because of dramatic changes to that ecosystem. 

Some might even need other species that went extinct too, even in a zoo environment. 

A modern example would be the Giant Panda, which cannot survive without a specific type of bamboo. 

Outside of the zoo environment, away from where humans protect them and supply food of the right type and quantity, recreating the original ecosystem might be a necessity for survival. 

In which case you need to recreate not just that species but its whole ecosystem, and remove existing species of flora and fauna and even bacteria from wherever you create this resurrected ecosystem. 

Our Audible Book of the Month, Michael Crichton’s 1990 novel, Jurassic Park, examines this concept, and the 1993 film adaptation brought dinosaurs to the screen in a way that made it one of those most memorable films of its period and spawned a franchise. 

It wasn’t the first fictional work to play with the idea of dinosaurs by any means, but usually we’d found some surviving population of them like in Arthur Conan Doyle’s Lost World. 

Jurassic Park though introduces the idea that we could bring them back instead, and over a quarter of a century later we are getting close to being able to do this for some extinct species, which raises many related problems and challenges, not to mention ethical dilemmas. 

Crichton examines many of these in his novel, and you can pick up a free copy of Jurassic Park today and also get a 30-day trial of Audible, just use my link, Audible.com/Isaac or text isaac to 500-500. 

Now in that story the resurrection is all being done on an island, to help keep it contained, but that raises two key points to begin with. 

First, any given island already has an ecosystem, and usually a fairly unique one, so you can’t plow one over to introduce a new ecosystem without almost certainly eliminating many species that can be found nowhere else on the planet. 

So if you don’t want to just wipe out some species to replace them with extinct ones, you need to be thinking of putting it someplace new. 

An island you made for instance, or one made in a desert or tundra or even off planet. 

Second is the containment approach. 

Needless to say this is much easier with the single-species zoo method than a replicated ecosystem. 

A single large creature like a T-rex, even whole packs of them, pose no real risk to civilization even if they escaped into the wild. 

This is not Hollywood and a T-Rex is not Godzilla. 

They would be easily located and re-captured, particularly since this is 2018, not 1990 - you’re not going spend millions of dollars making a dinosaur and forget to implant GPS tracking devices and health monitors on one. 

I’d be very surprised if those weren’t routine on virtually all zoo animals and pets within a generation and the concepts we’re discussing today aren’t happening tomorrow. 

So resurrected dinosaurs would pose no more threat to civilization as a whole than sharks or crocodiles, and indeed the large animal that causes the most reported human deaths every year, after other humans, is actually the Hippopotamus, averaging about 3000 of us a year, which is ironic since it is a herbivore, albeit a bad tempered one! 

Indeed deer, horses, and cows each kill more people every year than sharks. 

It’s not the big predators that get us, but the diseases carried by tiny insects. 

Bites from mosquitoes and Tsetse flies kill hundreds of thousands of people each year by passing on diseases like Malaria, Dengue Fever, African Sleeping Sickness, Zika, Ross River Fever and many others. 

What additional horrors lurk in extinct ecosystems are unclear and I, for one, am not keen to find out first hand. 

Containment won’t work well on critters like that because they are very small and reproduce quickly in massive numbers and you can’t realistically grow each one, so the trick of growing them in some other animal and having them be born sterile probably isn’t too realistic. 

This is another advantage of the zoo approach over the re-created ecosystem. 

Realistically we don’t have as much interest in recreating extinct insects or bacteria and both would be nightmares to contain, though we would likely want to bring back a lot of extinct plants and they can be serious containment problem too. 

You could build some nature preserve, artificially heated and lit, down in Antarctica for keeping your dinosaurs. 

Any that escape would just freeze to death, and they aren’t going to sneak out in a crate or letter sent home, but an insect probably could, and bacteria certainly could, and each of those make up way more total species than all the typical birds and beasts. 

There are roughly 5000 mammalian species; there are over a thousand times as many other species around on the planet. 

We typically are only interested in the big critters, but that’s not a whole ecosystem just the top few tiers of the food chain. 

Odds are good you don’t need most of the species around when the T-rex was alive, but you might need some. 

Generally an exact duplication won’t be viable. 

We have the expression ‘Dead as the Dodo’, for the dodo bird of Mauritius which was hunted to extinction by humans and the invasive species we introduced a few hundred years back. 

Now that’s not a long time ago so finding DNA samples is entirely on the table and indeed we have, damaged though they are. 

This is where we get to our first real trick for doing this. 

If you happen to find a totally intact strand of DNA you can take it and find an animal that’s sufficiently like it, say a pigeon for a dodo or an elephant for a wooly mammoth. 

You take an egg, clear the DNA out, and insert the new DNA, and do this many times to ensure success. 

However this requires you find a completely intact DNA genome and also means you just have one, which is quite the genetic bottleneck. 

It’s rather expensive to clone a pet but there are companies now that do that, not just research it. 

You send them money and a DNA sample, and they send you the clone of your cat, dog or horse. 

Doing it inside a different critter as the parent is trickier, but certainly doable and down the road we probably could use an entirely artificial womb. 

That might be preferable anyway since for many of these it is going to be humans raising generation number one, which is easier said than done for some species. 

Once you get them re-established they can continue their normal parenting cycle but the whooping crane for instance can be imprinted onto another whooping crane, learn how to forage for itself, can be taught migration patterns, and how to successfully mate, but 100% of the time the captive raised birds will abandon the nest, and their nestlings, as soon as they hatch. 

We actually have to have humans dress up like whooping cranes to raise them, and this had mixed results. 

More modern, animatronic tools have a greater success rate in passing on parenting skills. 

We can print DNA these days so you can get a sample that is damaged and instead of splicing it onto a related species, you can grab multiple copies and fill in the blanks. 

And odds are if you can find one partial strand of DNA in a sample you can find a bunch more. 

After all there are trillions of cells in your body and each has DNA. 

This doesn’t really help us much with things that have been dead for millions of years. 

It’s pretty hard to recover DNA even from a frozen corpse sitting in ice for several thousand years, let alone a fossil, which even nowadays people tend to forget is rock, not bone, and contains no more DNA than a plaster cast made of a footprint you left walking across some mud. 

The half-life of DNA is about 500 years, in this case meaning the time it takes for half the bonds in a given DNA strand to break, under ideal conditions. 

The oldest we’ve found is a bit less than a million years old, buried under ice in Greenland, and we think that’s about as old as you can get. 

Again, though, if you find a sample, odds are it’s not a DNA sample but several million of them, so if you are carefully extracting each one and reading it in, you are getting millions of mostly trashed but otherwise identical DNA strands to look at. 

Reading DNA has gotten way cheaper in recent years and needless to say so has computing power. 

Take a long sentence as a single line and randomly redact or scramble bits of it, put another below it and do the same, and you can compare the two and make more sense of it, do this millions of times and even if most of those lines only have maybe one word left correct you are going to be able to get that sentence locked down with utter certainty, but at some point it’s too degraded even for that and the hard cap is probably not much over a million years, and certainly far short of 65 million. 

Humans and chimpanzees share about 95 to 98% of their DNA and we share 40 to 50% with a fruit fly. 

You get a lot of DNA from your parents, and most of it is nearly identical, as your parents are much more closely related to each other than we are to chimps, but there are some differences. 

I can’t reconstruct your grandfather’s DNA just from yours because you only have about 25% of his unique DNA in you. 

However if he had about fifty kids by fifty different mothers it should be quite easy to determine his DNA enough to clone him. 

Let’s say we had two guys, not related, Alex and Calvin. 

Their parents both got divorced and remarried and so Alex and Calvin share a half-brother, Bill, who himself never had kids, but Alex and Calvin both had a bunch. 

Bill’s subspecies or clade went extinct, but we could mostly reassemble it by reconstructing both Alex’s and Calvin’s DNA and when it comes to a species, we don’t need 100% accuracy. 

None of us have exactly identical DNA, except for identical twins and even that’s a bit iffy. 

After all, not even all the DNA in your body is the same, compare two strands taken from different parts of the body and there will likely be a few differences. 

Indeed most of us have around 100 new mutations to our DNA that aren’t from our parents, just bad copying, and that’s how mutation and evolution can occur in organisms that just split by mitosis or clone themselves asexually. 

With enough processing power and samples, you can assemble a pretty decent match of DNA for any organism from its descendants, and in the case of a whole species we can do this a lot better since we’ve got a big margin for error, and can potentially reconstruct every extinct species from their cousins’ descendants, as we did with Bill. 

As we catalog more and more species and digitize their DNA, as our computers improve and so does our knowledge of genetics, we could potentially put together a lot of very long extinct species not from remnants of DNA from preserved corpses but rather from those remnants of DNA left around in all of us and the millions of successor species inhabiting the planet. 

It won’t be exact but that means nothing in terms of species, since they don’t have identical DNA to each other anyway. 

So we’re taking the “if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, you’ve succeeded” approach. 

Even so, we aren’t even sure if T-Rex had feathers or not yet, which really screws with our typical image of them as scaly rather than giant chickens. 

You could get some serious errors if you made the wrong thing and you don’t even know it because you misinterpreted the available data. 

Like if aliens visited a post-apocalyptic Earth and restored us along with Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse. 

And again we can’t overlook things beyond DNA, like behavior or associated organisms, both those inside and out. 

We’ll probably get good enough with DNA in the next century or so to be able to look at a complete DNA genome and model what it should grow into, and that would help a lot since you can backtrack various modern descendants and cousins to get prior DNA segments until you get something that has that DNA and will look like the original. 

That might be the best you can do, and you might also have a bunch of basically unrelated but near identical critters each with valid claims to be closest to the original yet are so different they couldn’t interbreed. 

An important problem arises, though, in that a critter is more than just its DNA. 

Indeed, humans are basically an ecosystem within an ecosystem, you’ve got hundreds of species of bacteria just in your guts alone and the number of bacterial cells in you outnumber your human cells. 

Many of these bacteria are also symbiotic organisms, meaning we rely on them and vice-versa to live, but they’re not encoded in our DNA as they are separate organisms that inhabit our bodies. 

There’s a chance extinct critters could use modern microorganisms, but there may be problems with this that mean we require the original microorganisms. 

Remember, though, that we said we did not want to recreate the bacteria and other microfauna and microflora species that would have co-existed with T-Rex because these are almost impossible to contain. 

If we simply recreate T-Rex without those smaller critters then there is a good chance that our T-Rex will be short-lived or sick. 

This is another reason why we would choose not to create an exact copy of T-Rex. 

Instead, we would tweak the DNA of T-Rex to use and react to modern bacteria in the same way other modern species do. 

We might also build in safeguards that would make it impossible for our T-Rex to survive outside of its assigned habitat. 

That was, of course, one of the plot points in the Jurassic Park series and, in the stories, it failed spectacularly. 

I believe, though, that the reality is that we would be able to do that job very effectively and would not make such elementary mistakes. 

It is something we are doing in labs very effectively even now. 

The take home point is, though, that the T-Rex that we create would probably look like T-Rex of old, but it would be a modernized version and not entirely true to the original. 

This is less of a problem with more modern extinct species, like mammoths who didn’t live that long ago and died in cold climates where frozen bodies have been found, or which died out during human history and we’ve got plenty of samples leftover, like something we hunted to extinction for trophies. 

We also need to tinker less with the DNA to make it work with our current microbial environment. 

I don’t think we can exactly erase that crime, of obliterating another species for fun and profit, but odds are pretty good we will be able to bring back everything we actually wiped out in the last couple centuries and that’s something. 

Of course we also wiped a lot of them out for living room, and that’s what wiped out a majority of those we didn’t, and humans are responsible for only a fraction of extinct species. 

If we genuinely wanted to bring back entire ecosystems, then we would have to destroy other ecosystems that have arisen in the same place as the original ecosystem. 

We’ve explored creating a glorified zoo with extinct species. 

But let’s explore the ethics of doing so. 

The main objections are that you either have to grow them in another distantly related critter, like a mammoth in an elephant, which many feel is unethical, and that you need some place to put them. 

I’ve also heard people question if resurrecting dead species in and of itself is unethical but I’ve never heard this argument actually detailed as to why it would be wrong to do so. 

There is a question around what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. 

The most popular view is that an asteroid or comet collision 65 million years ago wiped them out. 

If that is true, then why not give them a chance to live as well given that their development was cut short by an unfortunate accident as opposed to classical Darwinian evolution? 

We speak a lot about the Fermi Paradox on this channel and, given that we have not encountered any other life-forms beyond Earth yet, the dinosaurs are potentially precious as an alternative path life could have taken. 

While early efforts at this will likely involve gestating extinct species in living cousins, like the mammoth and the elephant, I can’t say that is a moral issue that keeps me up at night. 

It’s a potential serious problem if the mother tries to murder the infant or won’t care for it, but we have raised a lot of infant mammals on our own and can probably socialize them well enough to let them return to normal after we’ve got hundreds of them a few generations down the road. 

Though this could be a very challenging task especially if you’re not sure what the original behaviors were. 

It’s also a reminder that it is more than just DNA you need to preserve or figure out, you need to know what they ate, so you can restore that too or cook up something else they can eat instead, as well as what organisms they had inside themselves, like our own gut bacteria which isn’t in our DNA. 

You need to know their behaviors and social structure, you need to know what they can live around without wiping them out or being wiped out by them. 

We can potentially entirely skip part of that as artificial womb technology improves in the decades to come and since DNA does freeze pretty well and can be stored digitally we can afford to be patient about the actual resurrection itself, even if we probably want to move with great haste in acquiring the samples. 

That Passenger Pigeon DNA ain’t getting any fresher after all. 

That raises an ethical concern that’s arguably a bit fallacious but at the same time is not, that is if folks think we can resurrect anything we wipe out then we might damage our current preservation efforts. 

You don’t need to protect the panda because you can just clone them again down the road. 

Obviously that has nothing to do with the ethics of the technology itself but it is a legitimate concern. 

Similarly, early attempts especially might result in a ton of failures for every success, but that’s less an ethical concern with the technology than early efforts to master it. 

We’ve also got the concern that if you’ve got ressurected dinosaurs or wooly mammoths or dodos, people will want to eat them, indeed that might be one source of funding, people who want to have a dino-burger or mammoth steak. 

However, that’s the same ethical concern as with any other livestock and this kind of technology is going to run hand-in-hand with being able to grow meat in a lab that matches natural stuff and is maybe cheaper too, so I don’t think it’s too valid. 

I could be biased on that though, I might have been raised by a vegetarian but I’m not one myself and a dino-burger sounds tempting, but I’d still rather eat a lab-grown burger than one off a living animal, all things being equal, if it was an option. 

The zoo is almost attainable with our current technology. 

It does have its ethical problems and technological problems, though. 

We cannot easily separate the ethical issues from the practical ones. 

The primary ones of major concern are loss of natural habitat, loss of coexistent species, loss of biodiversity, loss of the original DNA so that the critters can survive in our world, and behavioural issues. 

We have already spoken about the fact that for an extinct critter to survive in our modern world, it will have to be modernized. 

That modernization, though, means that the original species is lost and what is created is a shadow of its former self. 

We want to avoid these shadows, if possible. 

To do so, we must also recreate all of the critter’s original environment, including the microbiological one. 

Recreating critters costs a lot of time, effort and money. 

The trouble is that such a species will not be genetically diverse and to introduce biodiversity into a population will result in a lot of dead-end individuals of that species, leading to suffering of the dead-end organisms. 

Despite this, for a species to survive, it will be necessary to develop biodiversity. 

Again, how can we do this in an ethical way? 

Almost all pack or herd critters have a social order taught to them by associating with other critters of their species. 

Many of the extinct species were herd or pack animals and we can only guess as to what their social behaviours were. 

Even today, orphaned elephants that grow up without a matriarchal elephant to guide and control them turn into the elephant equivalent of dysfunctional gangsters and have trouble mating and raising new young. 

To solve these problems, we are now going to have to move away from the zoo and adopt a more futuristic approach. 

We speak a lot about simulating our minds on this channel, but what about simulating entire ecosystems? 

In our future, we might be able to create a simulated ecosystem and this would allow us to create the necessary microbiological and other co-existent species. 

Normally such details are below the threshold likely needed for a convincing environment, if you’re shooting a TV show in a library it doesn’t matter if the books on the shelves are blank. 

However in this case such details would allow us to fine-tune the environment and see what will survive and what will not, how various behavioural models actually work. 

Given the necessary computational capability and storage, we can fine-tune the environment of the extinct worlds of our past without any chance of damaging our own environment or the environments of other critters we share our world with. 

We can even go further than that and allow the virtual environments to develop and evolve, eventually hopefully producing a sentient species that we can relate to as well. 

Given the sheer scale of computational power available to certain supercomputers like the Matrioshka Brain we’ve discussed before, simulating whole biospheres all the way down to the cellular level, even many multitudes of them, would barely register as a minor process to such computational leviathans. 

And that, of course, is without even considering quantum computing, and running through billions of theoretical mutations or ecosystems to see which are likely to end in something we have nowadays and thus to let us backtrack to the most likely origins, might be just the kind of process quantum computing is ideal for. 

Of course simulating an environment is one thing, but if we really want to allow extinct species to be part of our world, we will also want them to move outside of the simulation and back into the real world. 

Once the digital ecosystem is stable and we have the necessary biodiversity and a stable social order, we would render the digital system and re-create every detail of the digital ecosystem in reality. 

Space, of course, is an issue and channel regulars have probably already guessed where I’m going to suggest we put them, and that’s space itself. 

We often talk about creating new environments for humanity, be it arcologies down here on Earth or rotating habitats in space, so that we can restore Earth to a more pristine state. 

This might be the backwards approach, especially for extinct species, though. 

You don’t move humans off Earth to give Earth back to our cousins and you don’t displace existing ecosystems to put back extinct ones. 

You build new places for them instead. 

And while a closed ecosystem needs to be pretty big, it is worth noting that the homeland of the now extinct Dodo, Mauritius, is only 2000 square kilometers, which is fairly parallel to the size of an O’Neill Cylinder Space Habitat and a good deal smaller than the McKendree ones we could make if we ever master mass production of graphene. 

Such places don’t have to be 100% closed either, just so long as they are self-enclosed enough that you don’t need to bring much in. 

Assume for the moment that we wanted to replicate every major phase of Earth in the last half billion years since the Cambrian Explosion, which is almost certainly impossible without a time machine but represents our most extreme case. 

And assume that we needed an entire planet worth of living area for each phase and said we needed those phases no more than 50,000 years apart. 

That is probably massive overkill by at least a couple orders of magnitude but it would mean you would need a whopping 10,000 snapshots of Earth, one every 50,000 years for 500 million years, and a planet for each. 

And again that’s extreme overkill. 

10,000 planets sounds like a lot but there’ almost certainly a billion decently Earth-like planets in the galaxy that could be terraformed to match Earth sufficient for them – after all Earth has changed a lot in temperature and climate over that time too, and more over, the Dyson Swarms we so often discuss here can give you over a billion Earth’s worth of living area just around our own sun. 

10,000 planets worth of area is not quite 1% of 1% of either of those, terraformable planets or a Dyson Swarm, whereas the protected areas of the United States come in around 14% at the moment, proportionally a thousand times as much and more. 

So it’s a very tiny portion of the area future civilizations would have, more like a single zoo in an entire country than tons of space given over to nature preserves, and that was our extreme overkill case. 

Having entire habitats just given over to extinct ecosystems is certainly on the table then, and presumably would help fund ones that were totally locked off from visitors, just scientists and caretakers who ensured the habitat was safe. 

More realistically and in the more near term too, you could create thousands of such cylinder habitat nature preserves just in orbit around Earth with many thousands more just given over to people and our preferred pets and parasites without even making a dent in Earth’s orbital space. 

For my part, while I certainly don’t want to see Earth turned into some paved over dystopian nightmare, this does seem like the better path to preserving ecosystems, and even better for restoring extinct ones. 

Needless to say it’s an expensive pathway that’s really only available to civilizations that can build such habitats cheaply, but we’ve devoted whole episodes to establishing that we probably will be able to do just that down the road. 

And fortunately this is something we can approach with some patience, at least so long as we can acquire and preserve that genetic data. 

But I think it is doable and I think we will do it too, amusingly exactly because it does require tons of manpower and resources. 

One of our upcoming topics is going to be jobs of the future and a second look at post-scarcity civilizations and the problems these debatable utopias have, and a big chunk of that is what people do when robots are doing most of the work. 

Even if you don’t need a job to pay the bills and put food on the table, you probably do need one to keep your sanity intact. 

For that matter, civilizations need folks to have some interdependence on each other to stay together or they might die off, something we’ll be examining this spring too, and projects like these offer a potential common purpose and goal when survival is no longer an issue and luxurious comfort might be universal. 

If you’ve got billions of people twiddling their thumbs in idle luxury, lacking something to do and many wanting something to do, something that truly matters that they can feel good about, creating and maintaining millions of habitats to pay penance for our civilization’s prior acts of genocide is probably a pretty good pick. 

You can do a lot worse than being able to look in the mirror every morning and see a creator, guardian, and protector of previously extinct cute cuddly critters. 

So such places might get made even if they aren’t a tourist-funded location because virtual reality turns out to be a cheaper and better alternative in that regard. 

Easier and safer to go riding around on dinosaurs in Virtual Reality after all. 

That’s pretty far ahead of course and I suspect we’ll be doing de-extinction of some more recently deceased critters sooner than that, and probably on artificial islands in the sea or in desert or tundras, like in Jurassic Park, which again is our book of the month, sponsored by Audible. 

Michael Crichton has written a lot of books and probably had more of them turned into films or TV shows than anyone else, the most recent being the Westworld TV show based on the earlier film he wrote and directed, which is also set in a park where people visit, though that place seems too big for an island and I half-expect it to turn out to be set on a space station as a twist. 

Crichton is big on those, and I always enjoy his novels for having characters who seem to think things through in a bit more detail, they don’t skip over simple solutions or take forever to figure out things that are obvious to the audience and should be to the experts portrayed. 

That is something many of the film or TV adaptations do and that books don’t, and why they are worth reading or listening to. 

The novels are often much better than the films adapted from them, and Jurassic Park was a great film.

Evacuating Earth
---

So a giant asteroid is heading toward Earth and you need to clear everybody out, can you do it? 

Today we are going to consider ways in which you might evacuate a planet, and we might as well begin with four notes. 

First, how you do it depends entirely on how much time and technology you have. 

Second, it’s not just about getting folks off a planet, you need some place to take them. 

Third, it’s not just about evacuating folks, Earth is more than just people. 

And fourth, you also need to ask whether or not you should. 

I don’t mean whether or not you should just abandon a planet and its people to die, but rather that in almost every case where you might want to evacuate a planet, you can more easily prevent or mitigate whatever disaster would have caused the need to leave. 

Alternatively you might not have time to evacuate between when you find out about the danger and when it hits. 

As an example, a star might go supernova. 

There are no supernova candidates close enough to earth to wipe out all life, but if there were, you’d only know it had gone supernova for an instant before the killing effects appeared. 

What alerts you to this event is what kills you, no warning. 

Only if you had faster than light travel could you detect a supernova and warn people in time, and if you had years to prepare for the incoming event, you could arrange to put a shield between you and it. 

Some giant gas balloon to absorb it, a heck of a task but nowhere near as hard as evacuating a full planet’s population and ecosystem. 

Similarly, the Earth doesn’t get hit by big asteroids very frequently, like the one that ended the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. 

The bigger they are the less frequently they come, and there’s a roughly inverse relationship between size and frequency. 

It takes a very big one to do enough damage you’d want to evacuate in advance, but if you can evacuate that means you’ve got spaceships and you could just drop a big nuke on the asteroid, blowing it up or nudging it onto a new and safe trajectory. 

Even if you have to use several high-yield devices and want to send multiple ships for redundancy, that’s still way easier than moving billions of people on those same spaceships. 

That’s all assuming you’ve got some place to move them to. 

Though the good news is that if you have the ability to have made some other place livable for humans you do have the potential ability to move them there. 

Even if we had a billion rockets to launch everyone into space right now, without some place to send them that launch is rather pointless. 

That raises the triage issue because we often look at making some bunker to move people into during such a disaster, and doing that here on Earth, but we could potentially move some folks to a hastily built moonbase instead. 

How you pick those allegedly lucky people is something that’s very popular to look at in fiction and we’ll consider it today too, and draw different conclusions I suspect. 

For my part I’m not quite sure why everyone always figures you’d want to make sure you got your scientists off planet or into the bunker, that’s always struck me as missing a key point but we’ll get to that in a bit. 

In such triage disaster stories, which are older than history, you have to remember you are not just needing to save humans. 

Noah had to bring along 2 of every animal, and we have quite a few parallel tales out of antiquity. 

That’s a little more daunting of a task viewed in the light of how many species of animals, and plants, we know of nowadays, especially since outside of a flood you need to bring along the oceanic critters too, but amusingly this is actually easier for us in modern times, since you could potentially carry all that in one briefcase, more on that in a bit too. 

Returning to our fourth point, about whether or not evacuation is the best path, we’d need to know what the scenario is. 

The best known being the Supernova and the Asteroid but there are plenty more. 

Most of them do actually have this same problem though, where evacuation is either not the best approach because you can prevent the disaster more easily or just can’t know about it in time to act. 

For example, in an alien invasion scenario, building warships might be more effective than building refugee ships, even though they’d probably get wrecked by an invader, because the problem with evacuating against an intelligent rather than natural disaster is that when they’re done obliterating your planet they can pursue the survivors. 

As a rule, asteroids don’t get back up to chase fleeing ships. 

It’s an amusing aspect about the difficulties of hiding things in space that the most covert way to send ships out is to send them in the general direction of the oncoming enemy, since you can at least point the engine away from them, since that’s the easiest part to detect and use to determine their vector. 

If you send a bunch of scouts out that double as colony ships, spread over a wide angle, the ones that do get intercepted at least give you intelligence on who is approaching from what angle and how many of them there are. 

Also, unlike our intuition from down on the ground, it’s actually way harder to chase someone fleeing generally toward you than away from you since you have to stop and turn around, which takes huge amounts of time and energy, whereas someone fleeing away from you only requires you to tell part of your fleet not to slow down and to alter their heading a bit. 

Space combat is often rather counter-intuitive, as we saw in the Space Warfare episode, and interstellar conflicts more so, as we’ll see in the Interstellar Warfare episode next month. 

Another popular one is that a black hole hits the planet or get made in a lab and starts eating it. 

If an actual stellar mass black hole comes coasting into our system, and they often do, since they frequently get ejected at high speed from where they were made, there’s not much you can do but evacuate. 

That’s insanely improbable, space is huge and black holes are very uncommon, and the odds of one entering our solar system on a direct path for Earth is ridiculously slim, but they don’t have to hit us to wreck the solar system or to chuck Earth right out of the solar system. 

We’ll save that case as an actual example of an evacuation, since moving your entire planet through interstellar space if your star is getting ready to die is one approach you can use. 

The one made in a lab though is not really a case for concern. 

You could hypothetically make a black hole in a lab, the most frequent method proposed is a Kugelblitz black hole, something we’ve discussed a lot as a possible type of powerplant or spaceship engine. 

Those who remember that discussion know that small black holes don’t live long, and are so tiny it’s nigh impossible to stuff matter into them, exactly backwards of the usual perception of them chewing everything up. 

Most behavior of black holes is strictly theoretical, but if the current preferred theories are right, a lab-grown black hole would just oscillate through the planet, so small it cheerfully flew through dense rock without hitting anything, until it died. 

Even a decently big one, massing in around a mountain, that someone maybe made in another system and shot at us, would just fly right through the planet, as it’s only as big as an atomic nuclei but still carrying all that mass and inertia. 

It would kill you if hit you, that’s a lot of gravity compacted into a tiny spot, but it would just fly through the planet and continue on its journey, You need a rather massive one without much speed relative to the planet for it to be able to get stuck down in the core and start chewing on things, and I don’t think we actually have to worry about scientists accidentally crunching an entire moon into a black hole on Earth’s surface. 

Moons are terribly hard to get into a laboratory. 

Depending on the size of the black hole, if you just teleported one in there, you could either all be killed 20 milliseconds later when its gravity, which travels at lightspeed, reaches the surface of the planet and shreds everyone from tidal forces, or it could sit there for millions of year slowly chewing up matter. 

There are very compact and small artificial ones, as mentioned, that are actually quite hard to stuff matter into faster than they spew hawking radiation out, which at just the right size would create an equal outward pressure causing nothing to happen. 

That is an example of when you might have a doomed planet you can do nothing about but have plenty of time to prepare for, even if it is absurdly improbable. 

And that’s a key point, because again in most of these scenarios if you’ve got time to evacuate and the capacity to do so, you typically have the ability to prevent or otherwise remedy the disaster you are facing. 

Someone lets loose a virus or organism that is killing off your ecosystem so you need to find a new planet and terraform it, sounds good but it’s a lot easier to dome over and sterilize some places to be safe from it. 

At which point you can sterilize your planet and re-terraform it rather than do that for another planet. 

And if you can’t isolate the organism to prevent it getting into your domes, I’m not quite sure how’d you isolate it from getting into your spaceships and terraforming equipment and just infecting that new planet. 

Now the episode is about evacuating the planet, any planet not just Earth, though that’s our main focus, and I wouldn’t consider it much of an evacuation if you’re only getting off a tiny seed to plant elsewhere. 

If a hurricane hits some city, we don’t evacuate it by grabbing one busload of breeding age residents. 

Still, let’s discuss that scenario and triage. 

You’ve got a bunker that will survive the impact or a spaceship that can carry off some folks to a moonbase or space station. 

Fair enough and it’s better than nothing, but for some reason folks always want to fill these with ‘our best and brightest’. 

Which makes sense but the criteria seems a bit weird if it’s including Nobel-prize winning theoretical scientists, which for some reason seems to be the folks nobody argues about. 

Maybe because it’s science fiction so folks just figure the science is important. 

Refugees don’t need theoreticians, you won’t be getting any new science done for many generations and they’ll need to relearn it from books anyway, which take up a lot less resources and space, especially digitized. 

You also probably don’t need to keep such projects secret, I’m sure you would get a fair number of folks turned nihilistic and causing problems but I don’t think it would be as bad as we often see in films about such impending disasters. 

Anyway even despotic governments tend to leak secrets like a sieve and your typical democracy is so bad at keeping things like that quiet I’d be impressed if they managed to keep it hushed for more than a few days. 

So you might as well take advantage of the options presented by an informed public to build bigger and better ships or bunkers because it’s not like you’d have a choice. 

Any form of evacuation or bunkering up is going to involve a lot of hard choices of course, it is fundamentally a type of triage. 

You have to figure out what you can do before deciding what you can include. 

Ideally you want a nice fortified and well-stocked fallout shelter in your basement, complete with copies of important reference texts, but if you’ve got an hour to prepare for a nuclear war, building bookshelves down in your basement isn’t a good use of time. 

How do you pick people? 

Lotteries are a popular option but have always struck me as a bit cowardly, just a way to alleviate guilt at having to come up with a selection method and apply it, so you can tell people who don’t get into the bunker “Fate screwed you, not me”. 

One modern advantage we do have though is that we don’t have to select people for their genetics or romantic preference because we don’t have to rely on traditional means of repopulation. 

By default, under that, you want as a big and healthy a genetic pool as you can and preferably with most kids having half rather than full-blooded siblings. 

We can artificially inseminate women or even implant fertilized embryos of folks who aren’t going into the bunker. 

So you are probably more interested in parenting skills of a person than if they’ve got good genes. 

Romantic preferences or genetic defects cease being a vital consideration. 

You still have plenty of others, and expertise in a given field is never going to be the sole criteria. 

You want to know what other skills they have, their age matters too, what if they are married, are you looking at their spouse’s skills as they are essentially a package, what about their kids? 

You have to include families, not just because you need them but because the end of the world is going to be rough on anyone’s mind - unless they’re a sociopath maybe but I don’t think you want to repopulate off a bunker full of sociopaths - and making someone face doomsday with their spouse or children left outside is likely to result in folks so consumed by grief they can't function. 

It’s not a choice I’d ever want to make, so I don’t know what criteria I’d design if it were up to me, but feel free to discuss in the comments section below. 

I’d be curious what folks come up with. 

Of course it also depends on how long you need to bunker up and what you’re bunkering up against. 

If you’ve got to last a century your profile looks a lot different then if it's just a few years, you’re not selecting in the former for parenting skills because you aren’t repopulating off those initial people, just maintaining, it will be their great-grandchildren doing the repopulating. 

We’re not stocking a bunker on Earth of course, but one built here is going to be a good place to ride out any disaster that doesn’t kill the whole planet, easier to rebuild out of bunkers here than on the Moons or Mars, even ignoring that building and stocking those bunkers here is much easier. 

So there’s a lot of levels to evacuation and what you can do relies as much on your technology and preparation times as what the specific threat is. 

To answer the obvious question though, yes we could get enough people off Earth to the Moon with modern technology in a fashion that would probably let them survive. 

Saving our records and even our ecology is ironically now the easiest part of that endeavor, it’s not Noah’s cargo that you need a big ship to preserve nowadays, it’s enough equipment to support Noah’s family to preserve some working intelligence to revive stuff later on. 

We can actually store DNA digitally and print the stuff these days, and frozen embryos don’t take up much room, nor is that hard to keep them frozen on the moon. 

So even if a species does go extinct in such a disaster, you have a chance to bring it back, if you have the DNA, sort of like in Jurassic Park, which is our Audible Book of the Month. 

We’ll be examining how you go about resurrecting species, even if you don’t have their complete DNA, in two weeks, along with examining some of the concepts from that novel. 

Needless to say, digital copies of all our history, art, and literature, even including many redundant backups and a lot of material that probably isn’t vital to humanity’s continuance, won’t take up much space. 

Fundamentally the challenge there is making sure you have a self-sustaining colony or base, everything else is the same as setting up a normal off-world colony except there’s no one to call on from home for help with problems or resupply or rescue. 

All the stuff you need to revive humanity, our civilization, and Earth’s ecosystem though is pretty easy to pack along. 

It would be a heck of challenge to set up a Moon or Mars base and one big enough to be self-sustaining, but if it is priority #1 for the entire planet, or even just one large nation, it’s probably doable even amid the chaos and economic collapses you’d expect to be going on. 

Remember NASA’s budget runs about one-thousandth of the US GDP, and we rarely bulk produce the stuff it needs and try to gold-plate everything. 

In a scenario like this you aren’t building one or two of something, you’re milling out thousands of them, and you don’t care if 1 in 10 explodes on the pad if it lets you produce twice as many with the same efforts. 

I would not want to place a wager on their success with such a venture, trying to get a Moonbase for hundreds of people ready in maybe a couple years, designed so that they could support themselves and repair and expand it too, but I wouldn’t call it hopeless odds either, and it’s not like you have anything to lose by trying. 

As technology improves this gets easier and you can get more ambitious too, but I would say this is the last century where humanity faces any risk of extinction by a non-intelligent agency. 

We’ve only just gotten into the game, so our current hand happens to be rather poor, but we are at least in the game nowadays, we’d have a chance of salvaging our civilization even if the planet was going to be destroyed, if we had some forewarning. 

Jump ahead in time maybe even just a few decades and extinction from any sort of natural disaster should be off the table. 

As I said though, an evacuation is not the same as evading extinction. 

The goal of an evacuation is to get at least a large percentage of your people out of any area safely, and preferably all of them and their stuff too. 

So what would it take to achieve that? 

What technologies would we need to evacuate every single person, or nearly so, along with a lot of our most prized trinkets and living rather than frozen samples of our ecology? 

Now if your civilization is big enough, like if you lived inside a Dyson swarm, evacuation is easy enough, such a civilization wouldn’t notice or be hampered by several billion refugees anymore than the a major modern nation would be by a single person. 

They’ve got billions of ships lying around, actually they probably build that many every day, and their challenges aren’t getting people off and housed, but how to cram the pyramids into a bulk cargo lifter and which habitats are offering to store them. 

At that scale you aren’t trying to rescue the people, you’re trying to figure out how to peel chunks of the planet’s crust off and stick them in some ring habitat without wrecking them in the process by keeping the gravity pointing in about the right direction and strength. 

I’ll come back to that in a bit. 

Also if you are surprised I’m suggesting wholesale transport of entire strips of the planet’s surface, welcome to SFIA, since this is obviously your first visit here. 

We don’t really know the meaning of over the top. 

As is often the case though the hidden problem here is actually heat. 

If you want to get everybody off a planet in, say, a month, that would mean transporting a couple hundred million people a day, not even including any other cargo. 

You might have a near endless supply of spaceships, most of which are probably not designed for landing on planets either, but the sheer heat of all those things undergoing re-entry and then blowing out millions of tons of superhot propellant to get back to orbit might kill everyone from the sheer heat they give off. 

To avoid that, and the problem that most of those ships probably aren’t meant for landing on planets or leaving them, you need to be employing one of the options we looked at in the Upward Bound series last year, Space Elevators or Skyhook and mass driver combinations, or preferably Orbital rings. 

The good news is anybody with an existing fleet big enough to move a planetary population probably has those already. 

Now, you don’t necessarily need a huge ship either, again it bears a lot of similarities to the concepts and technologies you need for normal space colonization. 

Humans have a volume of considerably less than a cubic meter, our density is just a bit less than water and water is 1 kilogram per liter or 1000 kilograms per cubic meter. 

So you could potentially pack a dozen or more people into a cubic meter, at least if you’ve got a chainsaw on hand. 

But if we had the technology to freeze people, or rather to unfreeze and revive them, you could presumably put people into pods of about that volume, a couple meters long but not a meter wide and tall, in fact your typical casket is about a cubic meter. 

So you’d need a ship that could store 7.6 billion people at the moment, and at cubic meter each that is a cube just under 2 kilometers on a side or 1.2 miles, and massing at least 8 billion tons. 

Which is huge and massive but actually a bit smaller and lighter than the colonial arkship Unity we discussed in the various interstellar travel and colonization episodes. 

It’s also on size and mass range with a lot of habitats we discuss building in other episodes, and I mean modest ones like O’Neill cylinders not the actual megastructures like Bishops Rings, Banks Orbitals, or Mega Earths. 

So when your civilization is at the point that it can build stuff like an O’neill cylinder it is at the stage where it can evacuate the whole planetary population, if you stick people into cryo or some other stasis. 

You wouldn’t have to build much bigger to include everyone’s pets and most priceless heirlooms, and the ecosystem preservation is easier. 

There may be a million species but only a small percent of that are large creatures, you don’t need a lot of space for a sack of redwood seeds or frozen ants or bacteria. 

For most of the larger critters you do need parents even if you’ve got artificial wombs to gestate embryos in, but not a lot. 

You don’t need a thousand frozen elephants, just frozen embryos to implant in a few, there’s no genetic bottlenecking if the mother isn’t related to the infants she’s bearing and raising nor they to each other. 

Of course carting a blue whale into orbit is likely to be an interesting exercise but by mass and volume they are only the equivalent of a couple thousands humans and you need storage for 7 billion. 

Needless to say you don’t freeze everyone, the unfrozen, as many as you can support, are going to be busy building up support structure and habitats so we can start unfreezing people and organisms, the former of whom will go right to work building more structure and habitats. 

By the way, if you’re curious, the total biomass of Earth is somewhere in the trillions of tons region, nobody’s got a terribly good estimate on the actual wet weight of all total life forms but it should be on an order of about 1000 times what humanity is, so if you wanted to rescue every organism, not just the species, your big frozen corpse cube needs to be about ten times wider. 

If the mega-freezer seems too big you can also just decapitate everyone, we normally only freeze the heads these days, and generally speaking the tech needed to revive people is pretty much the same needed to regrow bodies anyway. 

This is the first state at which I’d say you could rescue all the people on Earth, and it does require a pretty bulky orbital ring to pull it off fast, and obviously the technology to revive people from cryo, but I would guess on both being on the table before this century is out, the latter is actually harder, but you technically only need the technology to safely freeze those folks, and that would be an example where you’d want your scientists in that field to be among the best and brightest you saved, or in this case, did not turn into a popsicle. 

You can’t store people indefinitely in cryo, though we don’t know for how long yet and it would depend on your technology, so building places to put them and feed them when you revive them and making sure you have the tech to do so is obviously your focus after that. 

Another possible route is to abandon biology altogether, as we discussed in the Hidden Aliens episode, if you have managed to figure out how to scan and upload minds to live digitally, storage of those minds is actually not a big issue. 

As we discussed with mind backups in Digital Death some months back, we don’t know quite how much memory is needed to store a brain, but the lower end values make it in the affordable zone with modern tech, and even the high-end estimates were viable. 

I discourage folks from assuming computers and all their associated components will just keep getting better at an exponential rate but I’d feel pretty comfortable assuming in a few decades we could do at least an order of magnitude or two better and that ought to be more than enough to cram everybody’s brain on a hard drive a lot more compact than a frozen body, or even a head. 

That’s assuming commercial hard drives, we can store data a lot more compact than that already, but for this kind of operation cheap bulk production is the important part. 

Those are the early, cheap and dirty ways to evacuate a planet, and again I’d be rather surprised if that was outside our ability going into the 22nd century, there are quite a few other options if one or more of those techs turns out to be way harder than we think, but that strikes me as the most plausible route. 

Going further into the future, if you want to avoid digital uploading, the key thing is having places to put people that can support them that already exist and can rapidly expand their hydroponics and air and water recycling. 

Keep going further ahead and people probably will be talking not about evacuating the people from the planet but the planet from the planet. 

It’s an insane exercise in energy expenditure to try lifting up a few square kilometers of forest along with the dirt the roots are in. 

You’d need to dome over and under and on the sides like a big terrarium then lift that that thing into orbit, probably on huge super strong tethers between orbital rings since the heat released by whatever megarockets you were using would roast everything nearby, yet the actual big trick is maintaining gravity in that area. 

As you lift it up into space, though not into orbit, gravity will drop a little from the altitude, but it would cease entirely if you were orbiting of course. 

Then you need to take those tethers and swing the chunk of landscape in a circle to provide centrifugal spin, which the tethers can handle since it’s the exact same force gravity was previously exerting on them. 

Trying to do that while keeping apparent gravity at about the same strength and direction is probably not going to work too well but you ought to be able to do it without everything falling over or flying sideways. 

I’d say it’s more trouble than it’s worth but if your civilization is actually doing this in the first place you’ve probably got very different relative values, and we have gone to some pretty extreme lengths to move large bulky human relics around safely. 

Obviously a lot easier if you’ve got access to something like artificial gravity but as usual I’m trying to limit us to options inside known science, or at least not banned by it, even if that means rather extreme things in terms of size and manpower. 

Of course you might decide you just want to move the whole planet, and that is doable. 

We’ve discussed some of the techniques before and will probably do an episode on moving planets in the future, but the big one is that same acceleration and gravity issue once you start applying thrust. 

Lighting the planet so it doesn’t freeze if you need to move far from the Sun, potentially through interstellar space, is actually not a big concern in terms of equipment or energy compared to what’s needed to get the planet moving. 

The issue is that a planet, especially the biosphere, isn’t really well suited for rapid acceleration, which as Einstein told us is effectively the same as gravity. 

Move some people on a platform at maybe a tenth of gee and they’ll notice it but be fine, move an ocean like that and walls of water are going to hit your coasts and stay there till you stop. 

This is what causes our tides after all. 

Now the force exerted by the moon on the earth is probably reasonably safe to use and maybe a bit higher, so I will say 10 microgees or .1 millimeter per second per second. 

Doesn’t sound like much, and it really isn’t, it would take 3 hours to get up walking speed and a thousand years of continuous acceleration to get up to 10% of light speed, probably about as fast as you’d ever want to move a planet even if you wrapped it around in shielding and point defenses systems to deal with cosmic radiation and collisions. 

The amount of energy needed to move the planet is vastly larger than what you need to light it if you could no longer use the Sun, unless you are going a lot slower, making the trip to a new solar system take a million years rather than a few thousand. 

You’d probably push it up to speed with lasers powered by the sun and down with lasers some colony fleet had built at the destination, with some very shiny mirror sphere around the planet, but alternatively you could build a thick walled sphere around the planet to fill with fusion fuel and provide shielding. 

Hollow spheres exert no net gravity on things inside them so it can be as massive as you need without bothering Earth, though you would need to use a lot of active support to keep that sphere a sphere and transmit that pushing force around evenly. 

But that’s your final option if you want to evacuate the whole planet in a very literal sense, just pack up and move to another solar system. 

Everything we discussed today is pretty extreme, even if the degree of difficulty between the options is immense, mountains next to mole hills, but is inside the realms of known science, obviously other technologies might make it much easier, but we can see that as immense as the task is, it is actually doable, you can evacuate Earth if you need to. 

Next week we will be looking at various cosmological theories for the Fate of the Universe, from Heat Death to the Big Rip or Big Crunch and many others. 

As it’s a longer topic we will be doing a two parter and will be joined by Astrophysicist Paul Sutter, with part two over on his channel immediately following part one. 

The week after that we will explore the notion of resurrecting dead species and some novel approaches to ecological preservation.

The Compendium of Doom, Part 1
---
  
2018-01-18  
https://youtu.be/rpA-Bd0d6kw  

---

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable So today we will be looking at a number of the models predicting the eventual fate of the Universe. 

As you can imagine this is fairly complex topic so we will be joined today Dr. Paul M. Sutter, an Astrophysicist with Ohio State University. 

It is also quite a long topic so this will be a two part episode, and you can watch part 2 over on Paul’s channel, which also an excellent place to visit to learn more about cosmology in general. 

To discuss the End of the Universe we might as well start with the beginning, both where it came from and how human thought on this matter has evolved as we learned more. 

The Big Bang theory was proposed almost a century ago and has solidified its status since then, but people have been thinking about the origin of the Universe for at least as long as we have had recorded history. 

They obviously didn’t have the same resources we have nowadays but typically drew three basic conclusions that remained popular up to modern times. 

Since the world around them could be seen to change on a daily basis, but not necessarily all that much or significantly, they tended to conclude either the Universe at one point did not exist, or it has always existed and changes are cyclical, like the sunrise or turning of seasons, or that at the grand scale it pretty much doesn’t change at all. 

Which is to say, snow may fall or melt on a mountain, trees might grow on it and die, but the mountain is unchanged and so is the world it sits on. 

It’s easy for us to look back to antiquity and how little they knew about science and dismiss their thoughts on this topic, but it still lays out the conversation we’ve had in more modern times and are still discussing. 

If the Universe began, then how did that happen, who acted or what occurred to make that happen, and what came before? 

If there was something before, was it like now and are we just repeating things in an endless cycle like the seasons? 

And if it has always been around, how is it getting renewed? 

Because you can look at a forest on a mountain changing and say it changes but the mountain does not, but eventually you’ll notice that mountains get eroded. 

Rain comes down and washes dirt away, and while you can see water evaporate and rise into clouds, you can also see rocks tumble down a mountain but never float back up. 

Talking about how things began inevitably leads to asking how they will end. 

Will everything just keep being renewed constantly or reset in some cycles or just wear down one day? 

Needless to say folks had a lot of notions for how things would begin and end, and they did tend to fit into one of those three options even if the specific theory was that Earth was a disc riding around on the back of turtle shell or elephants. 

With the emergence of formal logic and philosophy we got quite a few appearing. 

Aristotle suggested that the Universe was finite in size, centered on Earth, but infinite in time. 

This geocentric model would later be refined by Ptolemy and stick around till Copernicus, though even in Aristotle’s time a heliocentric model had emerged from Aristarchus, and interestingly Archimedes had calculated the Universe to be a light year in radius. 

It is of course far larger than that, but it’s worth remembering how shockingly huge that is. 

Archimedes had no idea what speed light traveled at, but he knew how big that distance he’d calculated was and it meant he thought the Universe was a billion times wider than the planet and contained a billion, billion, billion times the volume. 

We now know it’s at least several billion times wider than even that but it meant even then they’d come to realize just how tiny Earth was, even if they gave it center stage. 

This doesn’t get covered much but it should be, as Archimedes calculation of this in his paper “The Sand Reckoner” is considered to be the first research-expository paper, and actually used Aristarchus heliocentric model. 

We knew the Sun moved in the sky, as did the planets, that’s the origin of their name as planet means wanderer. 

We also had discovered the concept of parallax by then and the stars didn’t seem to experience it. 

Indeed it would be 2000 years before Friedrich Bessel first successfully measured the parallax of a star in 1838. 

Archimedes, Aristotle, Ptolemy and Aristarchus were all wrong of course, but Copernicus wasn’t actually right, and indeed since we can see equally far in all directions, the Observable Universe is actually centered on Earth and geocentric...but that’s a fairly irrelevant status. 

Every observer is centered in their observable bubble. 

We don’t want to get in the habit of thinking though that Copernicus was smart and right and arguing that his predecessors and opponents were stupid and wrong, rather they were quite smart too and Copernicus was just less wrong. 

As we go through these theories, which each radically alter how we viewed the Universe as we got some new piece of evidence, only to be replaced sometime later as we got new Evidence, we do not want to view the advocates of the previous theories as drooling morons arguing against the clear illuminating light of reason and evidence. 

So prior to Copernicus the main theory was the Universe was infinite in age, or if not had been created at some point more or less as it was now and would continue on as it was, but also finite if huge in size (although nowhere as big as we currently understand it). 

Over the next century his modified form of this started catching on but took a hit when Newton’s Law of Universal Gravity both cemented the heliocentric model - providing a mechanism to explain the motion of the planets - but also kind of killed it. 

If every body in the universe exerts gravity on each other, then they ought to fall together over time, and needless to say if the Universe was infinitely old there’s been more than time enough for that. 

So from Newton’s work we were faced with four possible solutions. 

First, the Universe is not infinitely old and appeared at some point all spread out and is falling in. 

This gives us a potential Fate of the Universe, backwards of the Big Bang, that it began huge and will end when everything eventually slams together. 

Second, that gravity is not an entirely inverse-square force, but gets even weaker at great distances, so that we are not pulling on those stars. 

Indeed this option has remained a common theory until modern times and we see it in something called MOND, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, one of the popular explanations for Dark Matter until very recently. 

If gravity basically just ceases at some distance, then you don’t have to worry about stars falling together. 

Third, that something is holding those stars from falling together, resisting gravity. 

Akin to the old notion of angels holding them on a celestial sphere, this was never too popular, and amusingly the discovery of Dark Energy pushing the Universe apart makes this the only one of the four interpretations to still have some validity nowadays. 

And fourth, that the Universe is infinite in both age and size, or at least size. 

16th century mathematician and astronomer Thomas Digges first suggested this one, that the stars were not at a fixed distance on a shell but spread out over varying distances all the way out to infinity, what is now called the Static Universe Model. 

He also first noted the Dark Night Sky Paradox, later known as Olber’s Paradox even though Olber wouldn't be born for a couple more centuries. 

If everything is spread out over an infinite volume, then nothing is moving because there’s always more stuff in the opposite direction pulling it that way too. 

This one gained a lot of traction and its main flaw was the aforementioned Olber’s Paradox, which points out that in an infinite Universe any specific direction you look will eventually be obstructed by a star, so the night sky shouldn’t be black with a few lights twinkling in it, but a uniform shade of light, we’d be surrounded by stars and feel like we lived inside a massive sun. 

Indeed, were that the case everybody should be burned to death, and if the Universe were not infinitely old, as Roemer discovered light needed time to travel and its approximate speed in 1676. 

So we could predict the eventual doom of the Universe would be the sky getting brighter and brighter as ever more distant light arrived until we eventually burned to death. 

Each of these perspectives had a lot going for and against it, in the 17th century and onto the 18th. 

As we move into the 19th century though we had a few new developments. 

We had begun to assume stars were not all fixed on some sphere and that Earth did orbit the Sun, so we could use that movement to engage in some very wide parallax measurements. 

As mentioned, Bessel managed to get the first measurement of distance to a star, 61 Cygni, in 1838 and two of his contemporaries, Struve and Henderson, managed to do the same for Vega and Alpha Centauri at about the same time. 

We managed to measure around a hundred more in short order but couldn’t for many others, we can see a lot more stars than that with the naked eye and had telescopes by now, so this inability to measure them told us they were very far away. 

We had another development in this period too, which was thermodynamics. 

Energy is conserved but entropy is not. 

We had no idea what made the stars hot yet, but we knew they were and should be cooling down, and that if they weren’t they were presumably being fueled someway and that fuel should be finite. 

We already had a lot of philosophical arguments for why the Universe couldn’t be infinite in age, but we also had the same problems for why it couldn’t be finite either, but thermodynamics and the speed of light piled on to make this much harder. 

If the Universe is infinite in size and age, then we should be cooked by Olber’s Paradox, and we would need to know what fueled the stars. 

If the stars simply formed hot at some point in the past, then they would eventually cool off and we’d freeze to death at the End of the Universe instead. 

We were starting to get a decent idea how old the Earth was then too. 

This is when we start getting the first formal scientific theories for the beginning and ending of the Universe, as we had to wrangle with these new issues and an increasingly large map of the Universe. 

Keep in mind at this point we had no idea what powered the stars, how old any of them were or that they had different ages, or what galaxies were. 

Everybody knew the problems with the Static Universe model, the one that reasoned the Universe was infinite in size and age, but it was sort of the default because alternatives had many problems too and none had any real evidence. 

Indeed Einstein would offer up a modified form of the Static Universe model in 1917, a decade after he unveiled Special Relativity. 

As mentioned many had thought the Universe might be finite in age but infinite in size, but he went the other way and said it was infinite in age but finite in size. 

This is also when we start seeing folks talk about the universe having curvature or being flat, no surprise since relativity had started the conversation on space and time being curved. 

In a traditional Euclidean Universe, two long parallel lines stretching off to infinity will remain the same distance, like a pair of railroads tracks. 

For all that they look like they’re converging to our eyes, you can walk alongside them and see them remain the exact same distance apart. 

In a non-flat Universe this isn’t true, and they might grow closer together or further apart, even though they are 100% straight. 

That’s not our focus yet and we didn’t know that the Universe was expanding yet either. 

Now what was different that Einstein thought the Universe would be infinite in size but not in time? 

There was no Hubble red shift yet to indicate that after all. 

This is, incidentally, related to what Einstein called his biggest blunder and that was the cosmological constant, a basic energy density or pressure to space, even in total vacuum. 

As mentioned, if the Universe is finite in size then gravity should yank everything together, so if it is finite in size either gravity had to disappear after a certain distance, or the Universe couldn’t be that old and had to start big, or something was pushing them apart. 

We had gotten enough at astronomy by now to be able to see stars pulling on each other with gravity with no indication it was weakening more than Newton said it should, so that seemed out. 

So if it was infinitely old something that had to be pushing those stars apart and that was the ridiculous cosmological constant, his fudge factor and blunder that he dismissed after Hubble expansion was found a decade later. 

We had to bring it back more recently, but will get to that later. 

For Einstein’s version of the Static Universe to be true it need to explain a few things, but we only knew of one at the time he suggested it, and that was entropy. 

Any model suggesting the Universe was infinitely old, had always been and would always be, has to explain why we still have stars and what’s replenishing their fuel. 

Or if not replenishing them, what was producing the matter for new stars and what was happening to the old, cold dead ones, which should otherwise accumulate to fill the whole Universe over infinite time. 

This is hardly a death blow though, since one can assume matter eventually resets, like shuffling a deck of cards will keep further randomizing it, increasing its entropy, but eventually return you to the original state, resetting that entropy. 

And possibly new matter just appeared from nowhere and old matter just slid into nowhere on a regular basis. 

Sounds a bit silly but considering the alternative is that it all just appeared from nowhere at the same time, it’s essentially on the same footing. 

It’s kind of hard to say tons of matter can appear from nowhere at one initial moment but that it can’t do that later on nor the reverse and just disappear. 

The other two flaws came later, one was intergalactic redshift, which came up shortly after this and caused Einstein to abandon the model, and the other was Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which was still about fifty years off. 

Hubble didn’t discover red shift of stars, that had already been noted, some were redshifting, indicating they were moving away, and others were blue-shifting, indicating the reverse. 

What got noticed is that very distant objects, galaxies, were almost all red-shifting and that the further off they were, the more they were. 

This of course was the origin of the Big Bang Theory, since if galaxies are all moving away, and faster the further off they were, that would imply they used to be a lot closer. 

This was the exact opposite of the problem with the Static Universe, which assumed the Universe needed to be bigger in the past if it were not either infinite in size or had some force keeping stars from falling together. 

It’s big rival for quite some time was the Steady State Model that evolved from the Static Universe version. 

They are not the same and folks often incorrectly assume Steady State is the old model that the Big Bang replaced, rather the Steady State model was proposed in 1948, a couple decades after the Big Bang Theory. 

In the Steady State Model we already knew that stars formed and were fueled and died, and we could see that intergalactic red shift. 

So it suggest the fuel for stars is constantly appearing in little bits and pieces, and that the Universe is indeed expanding but remains essentially the same and has always been and will always be. 

That’s not as contradictory as it maybe sounds, in a non-expanding Universe you end up with clutter of dead stars, as new matter appears to make new stars, but if it is constantly expanding than you have new room for stuff to be, and again the notion that single particles of hydrogen are emerging from nowhere is no worse than new bits of space emerging from nowhere constantly, which both Big Bang and Steady State claim happens, or that all that hydrogen emerged in one single flash of a moment. 

Now you might think you’d be able to detect new bits of matter emerging all over the place but keep in mind that our sun has several cubic light years to itself and several billion years of life, so the 10^57 amu of mass, or hydrogen particles, making up a new one would only require 10^40 of them emerge each second and spread over some 10^49 cubic meters, or one appearing every second in a cubic kilometer. 

Needless to say spotting a single hydrogen atom appearing in a cubic kilometer in a given second is not exactly easy to do, especially back then. 

So Big Bang says all the matter appeared at once many billions of years ago but space is constantly expanding, Steady State argues matter is constantly appearing and so is space. 

There’s no problem by the way with an infinite object expanding, twice of infinity is still infinity but it can get bigger, and indeed that’s permitted under the Big Bang too, which just say those parts of the Universe close enough for us to see used to be finite in size or even point-like, we don’t know that the whole Universe might not be infinite in size and might have begun that way too, we just know it’s much bigger than the parts we can see and that those used to be way smaller. 

So throughout the 1940s, and 50s both models were quite popular with scientists. 

The first hard hit to Steady state was the discovery of quasars, which in general are much more common the further from Earth you get, which means they were much more common in the past, they don’t get less common closer to Earth because our region of the Universe had fewer of them, but rather because they are almost all gone these days and we can only see the old ones because the light is just reaching us. 

In the Steady State model the Universe is expanding and gaining new bits of matter but is basically the same over time, so finding a feature of the Universe that has significantly changed over time strongly implies the Universe is not Steady and stable in its composition over time. 

So by the time we discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, Steady State had already become the minority view of cosmologists, though still had a number of supporters. 

Initially it wasn’t too bad a blow, as one plausible explanation could be that it was light from ancient stars that had been scattered around by galactic dust. 

However as we mapped it out better it became increasingly clear that it was very evenly spread in all directions, so whatever was causing it had nothing to do with our galaxy. 

When the Universe was a good deal younger and a good deal more dense, basically a big hot plasma, light was constantly being emitted by it but scattering right away. 

Just one big white-hot fog of hydrogen plasma. 

As the Universe expanded and cooled, it eventually cooled enough to allow protons and electrons to bond to form neutral hydrogen gas instead, which no longer interacted with all that light as easily. 

That light took off in every direction without constantly slamming into things and scattering. 

For the first time, the universe became transparent. 

The light was emitted all across the universe, sailing off in all directions and is now, 13.8 billion years later, arriving at every spot of space, since you can always draw a sphere around any given object, like Earth, that is just wide enough for light from that moment to be arriving,. 

We call this the Surface of Last Scattering and expect it to keep getting bigger and weaker till the end of time. 

Nowadays it’s microwaves, hence cosmic microwave background radiation or CMB. 

In the past it was stronger infrared waves, long down the road it will be weaker radio waves. 

That was predictable by the Big Bang Theory but not by Steady State or Static Models, so it didn’t quite kill them but it locked the Big Bang in as the overwhelming consensus model. 

It still isn’t the only one, and it predicts multiple possible ends for the Universe from Big Rip to Big Crunch, but it’s essentially the state of play for the last several decades till now and still running strong. 

We’ll be exploring those scenarios and some more evidence for the big bang in part two, and some more modern competing theories but as I said, Steady state didn’t die entirely, and indeed we got something called the Quasi-Steady-State model or QSS in the early 90s, which adjusted steady state to include mini-bangs, for instance, instead of matter appearing in bits and pieces constantly, it pops up in Big Bang events scattered far apart in time, but more like raindrops falling on a pond. 

Issues with this include why we can’t see stuff older than the big bang, or local mini-bang, but indeed we often have had objects or structures that at least initially appeared older than the Universe. 

This was particularly popular in what is called Plasma Cosmology, a theory of modest popularity in the 80s and 90s that was a variation on Steady State in the sense of the Universe having always been and always being, with no end. 

Like many such models it didn’t handle thinks like quasars or cosmic microwave background radiation very well, but as we reached more modern times we also had to deal with both dark matter and dark energy, and we’ll look at the impact of those as we move in to part two, just follow the link to part two over on Paul Sutter’s channel. 

We’ll be back again next week to discuss de-extinction of species and high-tech ecosystem preservation, for alerts when that and other episodes come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel, and don’t forget to subscribe to Paul’s Channel while you’re over their for part two and hit the like button for both episodes. 

We’ll see you next week!

Outward Bound: Colonizing the Sun

The sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a giant nuclear furnace. 

Without the sun, without a doubt, there’d be no you and me, but the sun is hot, and it is not a place where we could live… or is it? 

Welcome back to Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, and welcome to our fourth year. 

I am your host, the aforementioned Isaac Arthur. 

If there’s one thing this channel tends to be known for, it is truly enormous and over-the-top concepts, like artificial planets or moving solar systems or even galaxies. 

But we always try to stick to things inside known physical laws, and on those rare occasions we don’t we hang a flag on it and explain both why it probably can’t be done and some of the other potential applications it could be used for that get missed when using it in science fiction. 

We are going to stay inside those limits of known physical science today, but I’ll just warn from the outset that we are going to be pushing that a lot. 

When I first suggested an episode about colonizing the Sun, as a chapter in our on -going look at colonizing the solar system, the Outward Bound series, the initial response was mostly to assume I was joking or talking about Dyson Swarms. 

In fact, I mostly was - joking that is. 

About halfway through last year I gathered up volunteers to help review the scripts for the episodes, and to bounce episode ideas off of, and while I hate to admit it, their initial response at how crazy it was is actually what spurred me to give it a more serious look. 

While “Oh yeah? 

I’ll show you!” isn’t the best motivation for doing things, I’m glad I did succumb to that because it made me try to tackle the problem and it turned out there are a lot of options there for utilizing the Sun in a very hands-on manner. 

Now in truth we have talked about utilizing the Sun before on many occasions. 

A sun-encompassing swarm of habitats or power collectors or mirrors, a Dyson Sphere, is something I mention on the channel at least once a month, and is a type of Stellar Engine, a device or group of devices meant to utilize most of a star’s energy to some purpose, and we’ve discussed others like the Shkadov Thruster or Nicoll-Dyson Beam. 

We will review those concepts today, and some new ones. 

We have also talked about Starlifting, a way of mining resources from the Sun, which contains 99.8% of all resources in the solar system, not just hydrogen or helium but all the other elements too. 

We’ll talk about that today too, but we are going to go further and by the end of the episode we will be talking about walking around on the Sun or even in the Sun. 

This is important as our main motivation though. 

99.8% of the solar system is compacted into that giant ball of shining plasma. 

998 out of every thousand atoms are in the sun, 1 is in Jupiter, and the remaining 1 is spread over the solar system, mostly in the remaining three gas giants. 

Classic space colonization tends to ignore all that mass as being unavailable, even the stuff in gas giants. 

Truth be told even most of the mass in planets gets treated as serving no purpose but to generate gravity and fuel the occasional land replenishment via volcano. 

Even concepts like Dyson Swarms typically still ignore all that mass in a Sun as anything other than a source of energy. 

A very big source of energy admittedly, less than a billionth of the Sun’s light ever reaches Earth and only a small portion of that gets used for anything other than heat. 

The ratio is so small it would be like creating an entire hurricane just so you can get a glass of water, or breaking into Fort Knox to steal one person’s gold wedding ring. 

This gets at the entire appeal of a Dyson Sphere: you use all the energy, not just that minuscule portion of it that hits planets. 

You stick wads of solar panels or artificial habitats around a star in a roughly spherical cloud to use all that light up. 

Yet again, it still ignores all that mass in the Sun, except as a power source. 

Most people find even a Dyson Sphere to be a pretty ridiculous object, albeit mostly because even those who have heard of one think it’s supposed to be some giant inside-out planet. 

This was never what a Dyson Sphere was, but the misnomer stuck so instead we call the original a Dyson Swarm. 

Such a construct takes a ton of mass to build, and how much depends on how thick you want to build it. 

There’s plenty of mass even just on Mercury to build solar panels all around the Sun, but trying to build habitats with the available mass in the solar system is much trickier, which is where we saw the value of Starlifitng, harvesting a star for its matter, not just its energy. 

This of course is a bit of an issue. 

You can’t land on the Sun with a bucket and shovel and start mining for metals. 

Not because they aren’t there; in fact, if you scoop some solar matter off the surface, there’s a lot of stuff besides hydrogen and helium in that, over 1%. 

The reason is because it’s so hot, and also because a bucket full of the Sun contains virtually no matter, less than a bucket of air. 

The photosphere, the nominal surface of the Sun and where the light mostly comes from, is about 5700 Kelvin, hotter than any known element or alloy can remain solid at, and is a surface only in the sense that we can’t see deeper than that. 

The density of the ‘ground’ is about one ten-millionth that of the various rocks and dirt we walk on, and actually only about a thousandth as dense as the air you are breathing. 

Above that is the chromosphere and then the Corona, both of which are increasingly less dense, and finally the Heliosphere, which is actually where all the planets are located. 

So this image we have of the Sun as a sort of molten liquid is all wrong since you don’t crash into it any more than you crash into a sky. 

It’s not even a gas, either, but rather a plasma. 

It’s not dense at all, though far more so than Red Giant stars - what our sun will eventually turn into - which are so thin you could fly a spaceship through one if it wasn’t for the heat. 

It gets denser as you go deeper, eventually getting to be a dozen of times the density of lead at the center, but you have to go quite deep before it even gets as thick as Earth’s atmosphere, let alone oceans. 

There’s very little matter immediately under your feet on the Sun, again much less than air, and gravity is 28 times higher than on Earth, so you’d fall down very fast with all that force acting on you and almost nothing in the way. 

If you could dangle Earth down a long cord into the sun, like an apple on a fishing hook lowered into the sea, it would actually take quite a while to destroy the planet. 

It wouldn’t detonate in an instant like people would visualize. 

Indeed when we discussed one of the types of Stellar Engine, the Weaponized death-star like variety called a Nicoll-Dyson Beam, we saw that you’d need to leave one on full power on Earth for around a week to vaporize it, though you’d roast the biosphere off it in minutes. 

The Sun gives off 63 megawatts of light per square meter, around 60,000 times what the light intensity hitting Earth is, so if you had a floor between you and the sun and poked a hole in it with a needle it would light that room up as effectively as a normal window. 

Even diluted by spreading out for 150 million kilometers on its way to Earth, it’s still so energy dense that looking at it will blind you. 

So at first glance it would seem like being anywhere near the Sun ought to obliterate you, but it’s important to understand that damage is not just about temperature, it’s about energy transfer. 

We think of space as cold but there are plenty of giant pockets of it a lot hotter than Earth is, and you wouldn’t be burned to death in them because they are so thin no real heat will transfer to you. 

Your oven is a lot hotter than a pot of boiling water, but if you stick your hand in your oven without touching any metal for a moment it’s just uncomfortable. 

Stick your hand in a pot of boiling water for a moment and you are going to get badly scalded. 

There’s a thousand times more particles hitting every chunk of skin in that water than in the hot air. 

Indeed the surface of the Sun is actually a good deal cooler than its higher layers, the chromosphere and the corona, which are hundreds of times hotter. 

However, we have two tricks for getting near the Sun. 

First, until you get to the Corona, all you are encountering is lots of photons and a little solar wind. 

Photons can be reflected by mirrors. 

We use a lot of metal foils, silver, aluminum, and gold, though we’ve got newer materials that work better. 

People tend to think of mirrors as glass but there’s a reason why we talk about them being silvered: we used to use silver plating on the back of them, but aluminum plating is more the norm these days. 

Not everything reflective to visual light is as good a reflector to other frequencies either, so don’t assume a traditional mirror you look at your reflection in is ideal. 

The Sun gives off a lot of light in frequencies we can’t see and which typical mirrors don’t bounce well. 

However if you assumed you had a mirror that was 99% reflective to the Sun’s full spectrum, you’d only absorb 1% of the light you normally would, and so could get to a place where the sun was 100 times brighter than Earth. 

Since light falls with the square of distance, that would be 10 times closer, .1 AU. 

A quarter of the distance Mercury is from the Sun, a place already so light blasted that we could only consider colonizing it by living in mushroom habitats and sitting on stilts over the ground and shielded by a big mirror from the Sun. 

This close to the Sun, only a tenth as far away as Earth is, is actually where we say the Sun officially ends, the outermost edge of the Corona. 

If you make some reflective shield up front of your spacecraft you can get this close, .1 AU, and indeed the Parker Solar Probe scheduled for launch later this year is supposed to get to just .04 AU from the Sun, ten times closer to the Sun than Mercury is and 25 times closer than Earth. 

You can get closer, too, either by having a shinier mirror or by having a lot of heat radiators trailing behind in the shield’s shadow, cooling the shield and radiating heat away in that shadow. 

As you get closer to the Sun you eventually need to make that mirror shield more bowl shaped so the whole thing looks like a mushroom, as sunlight is no longer coming directly at you only from the front. 

If you’ve seen the film Sunshine, which is one of my favorites, at least the first hour before it turns into horror film, you can see how the ship uses that basic concept with a gold covered forward solar shield reflecting light away. 

The more you can reflect, the closer you can get to the Sun. 

So how shiny can you make a mirror? 

Theoretically 100%, and indeed labs have made materials that are completely reflective at a particular frequency. 

Keep that in mind for later, but generally a material will reflect different wavelengths of light better or worse, and the Sun emits a wide spectrum of wavelengths. 

You do get two other problems once you get inside this range though. 

First, the sun does radiate more than just photons you can reflect away, and as you get closer you aren’t just dealing with a higher density of solar wind but particles in the Sun’s upper atmosphere, the Corona, which can be around 2 million Kelvin. 

Second, the Sun has an insanely powerful and strange magnetosphere, and can start generating heat by magnetic induction through things. 

All those particles are ionized so we can reflect or deflect them with a magnetic field, but you need power to run such a thing and that means heat. 

Nonetheless, if you can bounce away all those particles no heat will transfer to you; so it’s actually conceivable you might be able to get very close, indeed all the way down to the photosphere ‘surface’ with materials that were ultra-reflective and by deflecting those ionized particles. 

This is just inside the realm of known physics. 

If we move over to science fiction, suns are always treated as automatic killamajigs. 

However, those ships often have force fields or wormholes, and if you did have that kind of tech - the game changes. 

I’ve pointed out before that a handy power source can be made with a wormhole by dropping one mouth into a star, but you could do that in reverse and suck heat out from some space station inside a star to keep it cool. 

This is much trickier without such technologies though. 

You could have a highly conductive or even superconductive material - such as a tether rising off the sun, carrying heat away from your base on the sun as fast as it got in. 

The problem is, that close to the Sun light is coming in from every direction below you, much like the Earth and it’s own horizon when standing on the ground, and indeed from above you too. 

The Chromosphere and Corona both emit light, just less than the photosphere, so you need to sheathe those tethers as well. 

It would also snap. 

A Space Elevator is hard to engineer on Earth, when it has to hold up its own weight for thousands of kilometers in Earth gravity. 

Gravity is even higher on the Sun and you have a lot more of it. 

You have to be at 5.3 solar radiuses, or about 3 million kilometers above the photosphere, before gravity drops to Earth normal. 

If you built a sphere that far over the sun, 3.7 million kilometers in radius, or .024 AU, it would have a surface area 330,000 times that of Earth, as big in area compared to Earth as the Sun is massive compared to Earth. 

If you remember our episode on Mega Earths I pointed out there that if you are trying to keep the same surface gravity there’s a linear relationship between the object’s mass and surface area or living space. 

Ten times the mass, ten times the surface area, a hundred times the mass, a hundred times the surface area. 

Of course the Sun may be 330,000 times as massive as Earth but as we’ve mentioned, it gives off enough sunlight to illuminate Earth a couple billion times over again. 

So this sphere would be getting 6000 times the light you want it to get. 

However this is about as close to the sun as a person would want to get since the gravity is rising. 

Using the orbital ring technology we have discussed before, the giant stationary rings full of super-fast moving magnetic material, like a pipe full of running water, you could construct a permanent stationary ring around the Sun, assuming you can reflect enough light and deflect enough particles. 

You could then walk around on top of this ring, with the same gravity as on Earth, and be well inside the Sun’s Corona. 

Now, before we ask why anyone would want to live there, let’s ask if this is as close as a human could live? 

Not a cyborg meant for higher gravity or heat tolerance but an actual normal old human. 

And the answer is no. 

You would have to be standing on the ring surface facing away from the Sun as the Sun’s gravity is pulling you down onto the ring. 

If the ring was stationary when a person experiences 1 g, normal Earth- gravity, then if the ring is placed closer to the Sun then the gravity increases. 

We can offset that increase, though, by spinning the ring. 

Spinning the ring has the effect of introducing an artificial gravity on you away from the Sun. 

No matter how much gravity you would usually experience if the ring were stationary, we can offset that by spinning the ring faster so you always experience 1 g. 

Unlike a normal spinning habitat, this ring contains two sections, an inner and outer, which don’t move at the same speed, but whose combined momentum is what they need to orbit classically. 

In this case, we keep the inner ring stationary and spin the outer one, or even spin the inner one in the opposite direction. 

You can also keep a third stationary sheath outside this to prevent friction with whatever environment is outside. 

This trick can be used to produce low-gravity bands near any star, gas giant, or Super Earth, see the Orbital Rings episode for a more detailed explanation of the mechanics. 

Needless to say it takes a lot of power to run such rings, which are giant magnetic machines, but you aren’t short of energy near the Sun; and when it comes to extracting matter from the Sun, the main method of Starlifting we’ve previously discussed specifically uses a giant magnetic ring to rip matter off the star. 

Other methods all have the problem that it takes huge amounts of energy to lift matter out of that gravity well, but the entire original point of an orbital ring is that it makes a phenomenal way to move huge amounts of matter out of gravity wells. 

You can also use concentric stacks of them, each a little further out, connected with tethers to act as elevators. 

We’ve used that trick before but it has two added advantages here. 

First each higher one is getting some light blocked by the lower ones, and second, you could probably transport heat up those tethers to help cool the lower ones, ending with one really high up, very wide, but perpendicular to the Sun. 

With a low solar cross section such a massive radiator serves for the ones below and as a pickup and storage point for ships coming in to collect material harvested below. 

I should note that our Sun is not the only star either, in fact it is on the large and hot side. 

Many are much cooler, even having surface temperatures lower than the melting points of some known materials, and for big red giants, they are not only cool but vastly less dense, and using these tricks you might be able to flat out construct machinery right over or even inside their photospheres. 

We will look at that more, and the interesting case of doing this with white dwarf or neutrons stars, in our next episode of “Civilizations at the End of Time: Dying Stars” So while we would definitely need to come up with a lot of new technologies to live this close to the sun, we don’t necessarily need any new physics. 

But why live there, in, on, or very near the Sun? 

It is worth noting from the outset, as pointed out in Colonizing Titan, that colonizing is not the same as terraforming and indeed doesn’t necessarily mean anyone lives there, let alone that they need to be traditionally human. 

We have a lot more options on the table if we are including alternatives like artificial intelligence too, but for today we will assume you’d need regular old humans on-site or in proximity. 

While it might not be a big hub for actual living, the value of a colony near the Sun, if you can successfully build it, is so huge that it would rapidly come to dominate the entire system economy. 

Even if it only takes a skeleton crew to operate some of these immense machines, so that it was like one person working inside a large modern warehouse, when industrialized you could have trillions of people working there, supplying untold billions of megatons of raw materials and trillions of gigawatts of power to a growing solar economy. 

There is nothing in this solar system that the Sun doesn’t have more of, except empty space and lower temperatures. 

From the Sun we can run giant energy beams out to distant energy-hungry colonies (more on that in a moment), we can use it to maneuver and accelerate spaceships, we can harvest it for huge amounts of hydrogen and helium as well as heavier elements. 

Beyond those, you can use surplus power to run a giant ring shaped supercollider… which is also basically an orbital ring… to turn lighter elements into heavier ones. 

You could potentially even be making anti-matter or kugelblitz blacks holes to store energy or use as spaceship engines. 

Whenever we talk about fully harnessing the Sun for power I get asked what we’d do with all of it, around 20 trillion times humanity’s total power consumption, and these are just some of the examples of what you can do, but in a nutshell, if you’ve got trillions of times the energy and matter, you run trillions of times the industrial output. 

Now I want to talk about Beam Propulsion again because we’ve been talking about using lasers to push ships in some of the episodes from late last year and we just mentioned beaming power. 

I often mention both as alternatives, if we never make fusion reactors a reality. 

Laser beams spread out gradually with distance, they aren’t beams of even width the whole way and the tighter you can keep them over distance the better. 

Now the traditional way to make these lasers is to suck up energy from sunlight via solar panels and use that to run a classic laser, albeit a gigantic one, however that is a fairly inefficient process and we have a far more efficient, cheaper, and vastly easier option called a Stellar Laser, or Stellaser. 

Here we describe a version conceived decades ago by Steve Nixon, who coined the term Stellaser. 

We are going to turn the Sun itself into a laser. 

Now we talk about lasers on this channel a lot but I’ve never really explained them, and this seems a good occasion to do so in some detail. 

At its simplest, a laser consists of a lasing medium we can excite, such as a gas that gets placed between two mirrors. 

We can excite the medium, usually with electricity or a big lamp, raising the energy of a population of atoms in the medium to the point they behave strangely. 

They behave less randomly, more in unison; they are stimulated to lase. 

Mirrors help stabilize the process.. 

As it turns out, the Sun’s corona is a natural lasing medium, already conveniently excited by the Sun's brilliance, like a giant lamp, and a rather powerful one at that! 

In the Sun, an ion is an atom where one or more of its outer electrons has been knocked off. 

In the Sun’s corona there are naturally-occurring heavy ions that have lost several electrons thanks to the high temperature there. 

Some of these ions are found in that special higher-energy quantum state. 

What makes the special state special is some atoms can easily enter via collisions, but it’s a one way trip because the normal transitions back to lower energy are forbidden quantum transitions. 

De-excitation from normal states is easy and fast, but de-excitation from this special state is rare, so these excited ions accumulate in the Sun’s corona. 

A concentration of such excited, but inhibited, particles is called a population inversion. 

This excited medium provides us with the powerful opportunity we need as it sets the stage for lasing, much like happens in a Helium-Neon laser, in which excited helium atoms transfer energy to neon atoms by colliding with them. 

Iron ions in the solar corona are already in this special excited state, all pumped up at 2 million Kelvin, trapped in that state and ready to lase. 

What do they need to enable lasing? 

Mirrors pointed at each other, mirrors of very high reflectivity at the wavelength of interest, such as a green light for iron, and as we said, we can make mirrors almost perfectly reflective at a specific wavelength these days. 

These mirrors need to be of high optical quality, very smooth, fairly large diameter, and positioned far enough apart to pass a beam between, through a small fraction of the solar corona... which is still a large volume. 

So put them in orbits at the same altitude above the Sun, or any other star, but positioned so the star is almost between the mirrors… just off to one side. 

Point the mirrors at each other and wait a bit. 

Spontaneous emission does occur, rarely, despite the forbidden transition. 

When such a photon happens to come from between the mirrors and be directed at one, it will begin to bounce back and forth. 

As it does, it will encounter excited ions like the one that emitted it, and will stimulate them to emit as well. 

These new photons will be emitted in the same direction and with the same phase as the incoming photon. 

This is the essence of Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, the LASER. 

After bouncing back and forth a few times, the resonating energy becomes quite large, nearly monochromatic, and mostly in-phase or coherent. 

A few additional components inside the laser cavity will make it very monochromatic and coherent. 

With good mirrors, the rays will be extremely parallel and will bounce many times. 

Rays which are not parallel will escape and no longer contribute to the laser’s resonant amplification. 

Nor will escaped rays subtract any more from the available energy. 

After a while, only parallel rays are being amplified. 

Stellaser mirrors are a bit of a technical challenge, but technology always improves when there is a goal and a motive. 

Use of large diameter mirrors eases some of the problems and makes it possible to keep a tight beam for a very long way. 

Huge volumes of solar corona means equally huge energies are stored there and the Stellaser taps into it, organizes it and unleashes that energy. 

We could make a small Stellaser with today’s technology. 

You could potentially be making these mirrors thousands of kilometers across, or putting thousands around the sun. 

You could also potentially use other substances besides iron as well, you’re not limited to that specific element and a green beam. 

This very simple design is also ideal for use in interstellar travel. 

We send in an advanced probe that arrives ahead of a larger interstellar vessel to construct a Stellaser before the other bigger ship arrives and use it to slow the ship down without fuel, as well as provide all the power would-be explorers or colonists might need. 

It could also be bootstrapped and expanded to assist a second wave of incoming ships moving far faster and carrying more cargo proportionally. 

So potentially these are just as useful for arriving at a distant solar system as helping you leave ours. 

Next time in the Outward Bound series we will do just that, and jump to Alpha Centauri, to discuss interstellar colonization concepts and the specific case of solar systems around binary stars, which has some interesting aspects, restrictions, and possibilities. 

Binary Stars have a lot of differences in how you colonize them than single star systems, and for that matter there’s a huge variation in how individuals ones behave. 

Their life cycles and how you go about utilizing them varies by a lot more than just how long they live and what color they are, and you need to adapt your colonization plans accordingly. 

As I explained at the start, we're still staying within the limits of known physical science in order to colonize the sun, and so this absurd sounding proposal is actually not that far-fetched. 

If you want to understand the scientific possibilities and limitations of modern space travel, then I recommend that you check out Brilliant.org.

Intergalactic Colonization
---
  
2017-12-28  
https://youtu.be/xRB7a89Jh7w  

---

People often talk about colonizing the galaxy, but today we are going to ask just how far away humanity can stretch its reach. 

So today we are wrapping up the third year of Science &amp; Futurism with Isaac Arthur, and I am your aforementioned host, Isaac Arthur. 

It’s been quite a year, and a long trip from our first year which only had 15 episodes, not the weekly setup we started part way into year 2. 

We closed that first year out by discussing Interstellar Colonization and I mentioned near the end that you didn’t have to stop at the Galaxy’s edge. 

Two years and a hundred episodes later, it seems appropriate to continue that topic, and to reflect a bit on some of the concepts we’ve discussed since then and how they impact today’s subject. 

We have discussed many times how you might travel to another solar system and colonize it, if you were constrained by the speed of light. 

Indeed we tend to assume moving at only a fraction of that speed. 

To do that, especially with classic humans rather than some robotic probe or seed ship, requires massive vessels that are almost miniature planets themselves, able to contain everything you need to start up an ecosystem at your destination and keep thousands of people alive either during the flight or in some sort of stasis to be awoken on arrival. 

We saw that was possible, maybe even with modern science and technology, that you could send out ships for century-long journeys. 

What’s interesting is that in most fiction, where they often have Faster Than Light or FTL travel methods able to move someone across a whole galaxy in maybe moments or maybe a few years, almost none of those sprawling galactic empires ever seems to settle other galaxies. 

That does makes sense when you have a galaxy already full of other intelligent life forms, since you can assume other galaxies will have their own too and not welcome colonists from outside, and it is a long trip just to say hello. 

However we see it even in fiction where humanity has the whole galaxy to itself and no special reason to think neighboring galaxies will have existing civilizations. 

When that’s the case, it makes a lot less sense. 

If you’ve got a spaceship able to cross the whole galaxy in a year, crossing to another galaxy should not be a problem. 

Distances between galaxies don’t scale up like distances between planets or stars. 

Stars are typically hundreds of thousands of times further away from our Sun than other planets are from Earth, and the distance to the Moon, still the only world a human has set foot on, is about a hundred millionth the distance to the nearest star. 

Alternatively galaxies are a lot closer together, relatively speaking. 

The Magellanic Cloud Dwarf Galaxies are closer to some stars in our galaxy than they are to stars on the other side of the galaxy from them, and even Andromeda, the nearest large galaxy to ours, is only about 20 times further away than the galaxy is wide. 

So there’s no reason why, if you thought the neighboring galaxy was empty of civilizations, you couldn’t make that trip if you’ve got spaceships that can cross the galaxy in a year, because they can get to Andromeda in 20. 

That would barely count as a generational ark ship, something we can almost do now, and should be child’s play for most galactic civilizations we know from fiction. 

The other big thing to keep in mind is that the space between us and other galaxies is not empty. 

If we view galaxies as continents, with intergalactic space as the ocean, there are plenty of little islands to use as waypoints. 

There are a lot of stars in between, and galaxies don’t have firmly defined edges either. 

Also, stars are often ejected from the galaxy, much like how planets can get ejected from a solar system. 

We aren’t sure how many of these stars there are yet, I’ve seen estimates as high as half of stars being intergalactic, but there’s decent confidence of it being 10% of stellar mass or higher. 

Equal or lesser populations than galaxies, it’s still spread over a much larger volume, so these stars are much farther apart, light centuries not light years, but they make potential waypoints on a trip. 

Decent ones too, because while most stars on the outskirts of a galaxy have low metallicity - and so probably not a lot of rocky material nearby - often these ejected ones were tossed out by passing near the central black hole of our galaxy and are higher in metallicity. 

Add to that, while an ejection of a planet from a system or a star from a galaxy often strips it of its satellites, it also often does not, and the closer the satellite is to its parent, the less likely it will be ejected. 

So the rockier inner planets of a system are more likely to be retained. 

That means these waypoints could have plenty of raw materials to use to refuel and repair, and potentially have planets to settle on. 

You don’t necessarily have to go sundiving to capture fuel and raw materials on some Icarus-like plunge into the star to pick up material, like we saw from the spaceship Destiny in Stargate: Universe, one of the few scifi franchises to seriously tackle intergalactic travel and timelines. 

You can do stuff like that too, as we’ve discussed in the Starlifting episode and will look at more next week in Colonizing the Sun. 

Today we don’t care about that though for three reasons. 

First, as mentioned we have discussed before how it can be done if you need to, second, odds are many of the stars will host planets which you can mine more conventionally. 

But third, you normally don’t stop on interstellar voyages to refuel. 

Oh, in fiction you often do, they tend to have FTL systems that are non-inertial, a warp drive that requires constant power input to maintain its speed rather than just coasting along, or wormholes or gates or hyperspace jumps with maximum ranges that leave you stopped relative to the local area, rather than needing to burn a ton of fuel to slow down and then more to speed back up when you’re done. 

Normally in interstellar space you head to your destination without stopping, because doing so costs you time and gains you nothing. 

And while I always say it would be nice to have FTL, it doesn’t really look like it is in the cards, nor do we really know the logistics involved if it was, since they are different for every hypothetical drive system. 

So we always try to look at the future assuming no new physics and see if we can tackle a problem anyway. 

Normally you wouldn’t want to stop a ship en route to another galaxy, or so we’d assume, since it will tend to involve a not-quite straight path between various intergalactic stars and that wouldn’t seem to make sense, but we’ll be giving that a second look today. 

We also do have an existing precedent for stopping an interstellar spaceship. 

In the Life in a Space Colony series, we examined a ship called Unity, a large interstellar vessel kilometers long carrying hundreds of thousands of passengers. 

After they arrived at their destination they realized that they did not really need to stop and stay there. 

They had all the manufacturing ability needed to take raw materials and build anything in the ship’s structure or colonizing inventory. 

This was up to and including the colonists themselves, since they were making journeys of many decades and could easily replenish their colonist pool simply by keeping a decent portion of them on the ship to breed more colonists for the next stop. 

We gave them both life extension and the ability to freeze people and thaw them out. 

Although both technologies were handy for growing the colonists’ numbers, they weren’t truly necessary since people weren’t dying off and could continue to have children and maintain a crew with the same goals and traditions. 

So this ship, Unity, decided it could transform itself from a regular interstellar arkship with one destination in mind into what we called a Gardener Ship, one that stops at a system, builds a colony, picks up new raw materials and fuels, and heads off to a new destination. 

During the flight, they would breed up their numbers again, and work on turning all those raw materials into colonial gear or replacement parts and supplies for the ship. 

We ended up revisiting the crew in the episode Interstellar Travel Challenges to upgrade how fast they could go and talk about all the problems one can encounter moving through space that fast. 

We also visited them again in the Dead Aliens episode but I consider that non-canon to their tale, which we’ll pick up again today because it’s handy to have a narrative framing device. 

So our gardener ship Unity has been slowly working its way out to the galactic rim, as have various sister ships, and indeed every so often the ship divides itself up like an amoeba. 

They can make every part the ship needs so they can make a new twin ship and do upgrades as new science comes in from home. 

However, we will still limit them to the 20% of light speed we gave them in our last visit. 

We will also ignore that the ship, which first went to the Tau Ceti than Epsilon Eridani, was headed in the wrong direction for Andromeda, so they’ve kind of cork-screwed around. 

Handily Andromeda is in the direction of the region of the galactic edge closest to us, so we don’t have to cross the whole galaxy to get there. 

It’s not quite the fastest route the galactic edge, which would lie more in the direction of Orion, and we need to head more toward Perseus to aim for Andromeda, but it is fairly close and a lot better than crossing the whole galactic disc. 

That’s also true of both Magellanic Clouds, we’re closer to them than most of the galaxy is. 

That’s worth mentioning because ‘intergalactic’ is a bit relative. 

Andromeda is the nearest big galaxy to us, but the Magellanic clouds aren’t much further from us than the furthest parts of this galaxy, and they are no longer the closest known dwarf galaxies. 

The Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy is considerably closer, just 70,000 light years from Earth, and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, whose status as a galaxy is still debated, is only 25,000 light years away. 

In all 4 cases, colonizing them is not really any harder than colonizing the more distant parts of our own galaxy, and there are plenty of stars in between to use as way points. 

I will be ignoring them today though beyond pointing out that they would tend to be settled along with the rest of the galaxy, though in many cases you will need to cross some areas fairly devoid of stars and pick your path accordingly. 

But it also means our ship Unity has arrived at the galactic rim a long time later, on the path they took it would be at least 30,000 light years and they’ve only been going 20% of light speed, not to mention stopping for at least a few years once or twice a century to set up a colony. 

So we last saw them sometime around the 26th century AD, centuries ahead of us in the twenty-first century, but it is now closer to the twenty-first hundredth century. 

They are fifty times further ahead in history than the pyramid builders are back in history. 

They are parked at a last lonely star near the galactic rim, the Terminus System, and the captain is deciding if they dare jump farther off and head for Andromeda or abandon the mission, finally stay at a planet unlike the many hundreds she’s colonized and left behind. 

Truth be told, she’s been planning this for millennia, captain of one of humanity’s first interstellar colony ships, even if it’s been rebuilt and subdivided dozens of times. 

They could turn around, they could get back to Earth a good deal faster with the laser highways between stars many worlds have been creating as they got bigger. 

They could settle here or turn perpendicular and help colonize the galactic rim. 

Indeed they could do all of the above. 

Spending decades to build new ships, one to head off on each direction of the rim, one to head off to Earth for those wanting to see home again, and one to head off to Andromeda. 

The science officer points this out and that they probably want a much bigger ship or fleet of ships to do the job. 

He also points out that individuals don’t actually have to choose, it’s the year 200,000 AD, none from the original crew are entirely human anymore, and copying their minds onto some clone bodies or androids isn’t too hard. 

They’ve done that before, for a crew member or colonist who wanted to travel on but also wanted to settle down, folks who had a spouse or kids who wanted to stay and they couldn’t decide if they wanted to stay or go, so they did both, making a copy of themselves. 

Or when the ship subdivided, building a twin to head off at a different angle to colonize other systems. 

They have some crew members who have done that many times, same as they have others who sleep most of the journey. 

This is the original ship, for a given value of original, that headed out from Earth 200,000 years ago, and the original captain, for a given value of original, who piloted it out, and the original science officer, for a given value of original, who has been nitpicking her plans since Unity was on the drawing board. 

But the ship can’t make the journey on its own, so the science officer says. 

This ship is immense, bigger than when it left Earth and you could have crammed a major metropolis into that one. 

But to do this right, they are going to want a whole fleet and they need to build that here at Terminus. 

Now we say Terminus is the last star at this edge of the galaxy but that’s not entirely true. 

It’s actually an extragalactic system sent on its way many millions of years ago and just now getting out of the galaxy. 

In fact with a little bit of nudging, it could be aimed to reach Andromeda. 

They could colonize it and just wait. 

Andromeda is, after all, set to merge with the Milky Way galaxy in a few billion years and they could get this whole system to arrive there a good deal sooner than that. 

There is a highly advanced technology called a Shkadov Thruster, whose design is actually a very simplistic one. 

It calls for trillions of cheap mirrors to be placed around a star so that they bounce all its light in one direction, providing thrust and allowing you turn a whole solar system into an interstellar spaceship. 

You can also boost that speed by using the solar wind of the star as propellant, or modifying starlifting technology to create a giant plasma drive. 

Normally, this is no way to cross between stars. 

They take half of forever to get up to speed, but while it takes millions of years for them to get up to even modest interstellar velocities, it also takes millions of years to travel between galaxies. 

At their current cruising speed of 20% of light speed, they will need ten million years to get to Andromeda. 

It’s been fifty times as long since this ship was built as between then and when the pyramids were built, and it will be fifty times as long as their entire past journey to get to Andromeda this way. 

They could turn the entire Terminus System into one huge spaceship - technologically speaking it's simplistic - and head off to Andromeda that way. 

However it will take longer, many tens of millions of years at least. 

Potentially they could use a miniaturised version of this, turning a gas giant into a giant fusion-driven ship, but fundamentally this is just a super-sized version of the ship they already have. 

The captain mulls both option over but rejects them. 

She has been dreaming of being the first to set foot in another galaxy for thousands of years, and that’s the kind of commitment that borders on the obsessive. 

Tell me how we do it fastest, that’s what she want to know, and why a fleet, why not a bigger ship? 

Why even a bigger ship? 

The science officer says he’s very dubious - even with all their technology that can fabricate any part they need to replace - of being able to cruise the entire intergalactic void for ten million years without breaking down. 

That’s not why he wants other ships though, not as spares. 

He wants to make stops along the way, and using astronomical data gathered from some of their colonies a few light centuries back, which are now civilizations a couple of thousand years old with lots of giant telescopes, they found a modestly straight path with stars never more than a thousand light years apart. 

The captain stops him though, and asks why not a straight path, instead of using Terminus as a giant spaceship with all those mirrors, why not use a variant of that, turn it into a giant laser to push the ship to near light speed so they can make the journey in a fifth of the time. 

He shakes his head at that, that’s part of the idea in truth but too simplistic. 

Even at that speed it’s a 2 million year journey, and even if they hug the speed of light to get time dilation, so less time passes for them and the ship, and even with the intergalactic void being far thinner so they get less drag and collisions to damage or slow the ship, going that long with no resupply is a dubious proposition. 

But more to the point, they can’t slow down when they arrive. 

The ship’s defense officer objects to that, if collisions slow the ship, why not let space drag slow them down? 

When they approach the galaxy they can expand out a thin sail to get smacked into and slow the ship. 

Even a magnetic field that will deflect ionized particles off and exchange momentum with them. 

The faster you’re going the more each particle slows you, so once you get down to a modest speed you can use the ship’s regular engine to finish slowing down. 

The science officer agrees it is viable, but not ideal, such a slowdown still takes huge amount of time and distance and would leave them a huge distance from any possible help and needing to ration out their supplies on the whole journey with not much margin for error, and on something totally untested. 

It could work, they could build a massive laser array and use it like a giant cannon to hurl themselves out of the galaxy at near light speed then slow down by using the local interstellar medium to break them to more normal speeds. 

But he hasn’t lived 200,000 years by throwing dice and he doesn’t want to leave it so people have to do the same thing in the future. 

The science officer wants to build a big intergalactic bridge, using the Laser Highway system, and he wants to colonize each star system along the way. 

By doing that they will always be in some sort of range of civilization and future ships will be able to cross at near light speeds safely, with each bridge star from Terminus running a laser relay to push ships faster or slow them down. 

Done this way people can always go home, or send follow up missions that will be able to catch up to them, and reinforce them. 

Done the other way it’s a bit like burning your ships when you reach a new shore. 

What they’ll do is build a fleet. 

Once everyone is up to speed, they’ll accelerate a bit more, more than they could normally slow down from. 

Then they’ll transfer some extra fuel from each ship to one ship, which they’ll all then push on with their prow-mounted lasers, speeding it up a bit, and it’s got fuel to slow down from a slightly higher velocity. 

When it arrives at the next target system, it will get to work building lasers to slow them all down, though they’ve already slowed a bit pushing that vanguard ship. 

If the Vanguard fails in its job they can cannibalize fuel from the various ships, transfer people over, and jettison some mass, to ensure they can still slow down at the destination system. 

They’ll have many stopovers to practice this and get it down right, and after thousands of years of doing century long trips, they’re confident they can keep the ships running through their normal methods for the few thousand years most of the intergalactic jumps will take. 

Better yet, with each system along the way colonized and with a pushing laser there, they can arrange for critical resupply if something goes wrong. 

They can just wait at the next system or slow down as much as they can and go mostly on ice till rescue arrives, even if that take thousands of years. 

Thousands of years sounds like an eternity, but it’s nothing compared to millions and that your best time for rescue if you aren’t doing stopovers. 

You’re also sailing through mostly empty intergalactic void if something goes wrong here, and probably slower than before, not plowing through an uncharted galaxy at relativistic speeds. 

It’s very iffy if a frozen body could be revived after millions of years too, thousands would probably leave something to work with in terms of brain structure and is a lot more realistic for a digital copy of a mind to repair off of. 

And you only have to go that route if you’re getting critical failure across the fleet. 

Most of the time if something goes wrong you could transfer to another ship and cannibalize some for fuel or material to repair and slow down. 

When you’re done, even though it takes around ten million years, you’ve been busy the whole time founding new colonies that can still talk to each other and send ships through at very relativistic speeds, enough that the journey will seem shorter to them from time dilation. 

Those ships only need enough extra fuel and supplies to course correct to the next relay point if something goes wrong there, and it will be a whole colonized system. 

Subsequent intergalactic trips will occur at nearly light speed, including follow up colonization missions. 

What’s more, if it turns out that the galaxy you’re arriving at is occupied, and ten million years is a long enough time frame that something might have evolved from chimpanzee to interstellar civilization in that time, you do have a way to go home. 

So Unity sets off from the Terminus system toward the Andromeda Galaxy, and their first waypoint along the way, and assuming nothing goes wrong, it will take them a bit less than ten million years to arrive, using only fusion and lasers to do it, technologies probably fully developed by the end of the 21st century. 

Okay, let’s consider some other scenarios. 

First, we mentioned that you could mobilize an entire solar system as one giant space ark, the straight Shkadov Thruster route is the technologically easiest approach but via starlifting you can accelerate a lot faster by firing helium out as a propellant, siphoning out heavier elements in the star for construction, and recycling hydrogen back down for the star to eventually burn perhaps. 

This same technique can be used galaxy-wide, and we’ll come back to that in a moment, but it’s worth remembering that galaxies are not static and that Andromeda is headed toward us. 

That’s actually quite rare, virtually every galaxy is moving away from us and the further away they are, the faster they are moving. 

Some folks ask how far off we could colonize the Universe, if it was empty, and the answer is that your absolute maximum depends on how fast your ships can travel versus what the redshift of the target galaxy is. 

That’s about 20 kilometers per second for every million light years of distance, or 20,000 kilometers at 1 billion light years, about 7% of light speed. 

Our ships were averaging about 20% of light speed, so it could catch up to a galaxy moving just under 20% of light speed some 3 billion light years away, though it would take longer than the Universe is old to arrive with such a slow relative speed, just a little faster toward its destination than that destination is moving away. 

Fortunately the closer you get the slower it will be moving away, but unless you want to take half of eternity to get to your destination you don’t aim for anything moving away at much more than maybe half your maximum speed. 

This is part of why when asked I usually say a billion light years is about as far as humans can colonize without FTL systems. 

That’s a lot of living space too, many thousands of galaxies. 

However we do have other drive options, that laser slingshot and magnetic sail slowdown method from earlier would probably work, it’s not ideal for interstellar travel to neighboring stars but it ought to work over much larger distances, even well short of intergalactic ones. 

And you could do it at every waypoint. 

It only takes a year at one-gee of thrust to get to near light speed and the same to go back down, so you can get away with stopping between stars as waypoints without losing much time, at least when those distances are much larger than the normal interstellar scale. 

Slowing down without fuel by collision or magnetic braking is all about how fast you are going, how thick the interstellar or intergalactic dust and gas are, and how big your braking sail is, but think centuries not minutes, even for an immense sail. 

That aside, and ignoring our example of Unity today, it would probably be how I would do it. 

We also have options for black hole drives or anti-matter drives or maybe quark fusion or some other new concept, which might allow higher travel speeds and expand that radius we might colonize a lot. 

However, I said that was part of the reason I usually put it at a billion light years. 

There are three others. 

First, it does take time to colonize places and most colonists will want to go the nearest and easiest empty place, so even if you’ve got ships that could make speed to get to some place four billion light years away, and do it fast enough to arrive before it ran out of stars to colonize, you’d presumably want to stop along the way. 

Second, if you aim to the edge of your speed, you could arrive when there are no stars left, but more importantly if you are arriving somewhere 2 billion years from now, I’d find it very hard to believe that you’d be arriving at an unoccupied place. 

The older the Universe gets, the more likely life is to develop and get technology. 

Worlds that already have life have more time to evolve, most stars live a lot longer than ours does, and the metallicity of new stars rises, meaning more rocky planets in general. 

I’m on the extreme skeptic end in terms of the Fermi Paradox, in that I doubt any civilizations have arisen within a billion light years of us, see the Dyson Dilemma 2.0 episode or various Fermi Paradox episodes for explanations of that reasoning, but I’d have a very hard time believing you could arrive at a galaxy 3 billion years away from us, and maybe 10 billion years ahead in time, and find it was still absent of intelligent life. 

Third, the Universe is expanding, and only a handful of galaxies are near enough to us to stick with us as that happens. 

However, just as you can move a star you can move a galaxy, you just build those Shkadov Thrusters around every star and let gravity tractor it with you. 

And most of the galaxies within a billion light years of us are going slow enough you could slow them down this way to stay bound to us. 

If you can’t, then any of those colonies are destined to be forever gone. 

You won’t ever be able to talk to them again at some point. 

Of course you might not care, and anyone sent on billion year long quests are going to have more time to have diverged from you than humans have with oak trees, though that problem already exists at the Interstellar level and is probably beyond manageable even at the galactic scale already. 

That’s why we discussed alternatives like the light year wide Birch Planets from the Mega Earths episode. 

Don’t overlook that option though, as huge as a galaxy is and as long as billions of years is, you can move one, there’s no tricky physics involved, it’s just an application of brute force on a galactic level, astronomical timelines and energy needs, but you have both. 

We have no idea where the closest civilization to us is, might be within a few hundred light years, might be none in the whole Observable Universe, and with all the time it takes light to reach us and for our ships to arrive there, especially in intergalactic terms, what we can see now doesn’t necessarily mean much compared to when you arrive. 

A galaxy a billion light years away might be absent technological civilizations a billion years ago, when that light left, but would it still be a few billion years from now, when you arrived? 

We can’t know, but for my part an unused and dead solar system is one we should always claim if there’s nobody around there or nearby asserting their own claim. 

And I would expect an alien civilization to do the same, not because they or we are aggressive and hostile, but because a random space rock around a lifeless star just has less inherent value than a tree or cat or a dog or a person or even an inanimate statue someone has carved. 

And while some might claim otherwise, every breath they take puts the lie to that claim that they think their life is no more valuable. 

I don’t know many people who say otherwise and I don’t believe the few who do genuinely believe that, so when someone asks why colonize other places, be it other planets or other stars or even other galaxies, I always feel it’s the wrong question. 

Not why would you, if you could, but why wouldn’t you? 

I don’t know if humanity is destined to colonize other galaxies, I’d never support doing so if someone else already lived there, but should it turn out that intelligent life is that rare I think we should, and as we’ve seen today it is on the table, even if we never figure out how to make warp drives or wormholes. 

As we head into 2018, two generations after we last set foot on the moon, I think it does help to remember that the sky is not the limit and that we have potential new frontiers for billions of years to come. 

And we are going to keep on exploring them next year. 

Until next time, thanks for watching, and have a great year!

Interstellar Empires

In all of human history, no empire has ever united the entire planet. 

Ruling over an entire solar system, let alone thousands or billions of them, is a far more daunting task. 

Today we are discussing the notion of interstellar empires, civilizations so large they encompass many solar systems and perhaps the galaxy itself, and we are going to look at some of the problems doing so and how they might be overcome or circumvented. 

Of course, the biggest problem from the outset is the speed of light, to the best of our knowledge there’s no way to exceed it. 

So if you rule over some mighty empire of a thousand stars spread over a hundred light years, one of your outlying planets might rebel and you wouldn’t even know they had for a century. 

If you immediately dispatch a fleet to go crush the rebels, it will take them at least another century to arrive, meaning the great-grandchildren of the soldiers you sent will land to re-conquer a planet who regards their rebellion as ancient history. 

This is even more exacerbated in a full galactic empire, where the edge isn’t a hundred light years away but a hundred thousand. 

It might easily take a million years for you to hear about a problem and get a fleet there to deal with it, and on those kinds of timelines, even without genetic engineering as an option, you might as well be invading an unknown alien species. 

As I’ve said before, while there probably aren’t any alien civilizations in this galaxy, you just have to be patient because they’ll arrive eventually and they’ll be related to you because Earth will be their original planet too. 

So there is often a feeling that no interstellar empire is possible unless you have either FTL (Faster than Light), travel or communication, or a way to let people live much longer, life extension technology. 

In our SFIA book of the Month, sponsored by Audible, Frank Herbert’s Dune, they had both, and from the same source too, the Spice Melange that extended human lifespans and allowed them to safely use the FTL system they had, as it granted some precognitive abilities. 

A unified empire is a bit more realistic there too, as you’ve got only one place that provides the spice, the desert planet Dune, and only one group that provides space travel, the Guild. 

It’s hard to keep systems unified even with FTL, as we’ll discuss, but Monopolies are a decent approach, and Dune examines such concepts in an exciting and thought-provoking way that has made it one of the greatest classic of science fiction. 

You can pick up a free copy of Dune today and get a 30-day trial of Audible, just use my link, Audible.com/Isaac or text isaac to 500-500. 

Dune also does a good job showing both how immense in space and time such empires almost have to be, which is something a lot of our fictional examples fail at horribly, though it’s a difficult task. 

Quite a few will say that they’ve got an empire of a million worlds, but what they show us seems like maybe a few dozen that themselves seem more like single cities or small states. 

Even then, saying you’ve got a million planets spanning the galaxy still implies you’ve only colonized about 1 in 100,000 solar systems. 

If you want a million solar systems, you don’t need a whole galaxy either, there’s about that many within 400 light years of Earth. 

If you’ve got a map of the galaxy on 1080p screen, each pixel would be about 100 light years and such a million-system empire would be about 8 pixels wide. 

Even a single pixel, a diameter of 100 light years or a radius of 50, should contain a couple thousand systems with most probably having at least one planet that was no harder to terraform than Mars or Venus are. 

Fictional galactic empires are always woefully underpopulated, the galaxy ought to contain at least a billion planets close enough to Earth in gravity, temperature, and day length that you’d have problems noticing the differences and given the technologies most are shown possessing, and also that we are often shown them including planets that are very non-terrestrial, they ought to have trillions of planets, not millions, and that’s without even getting into megastructures and artificial habitats, which let you house a whole billion-planet empire in a single solar system. 

If you’re a channel regular and know all about Dyson Spheres and Kardashev 2 civilizations, then you already know that if you are talking about some empire containing billions of worlds each with hundreds of thousands or millions of people, like most sci fi planets seem to have rather than being fully populated, you aren’t talking about an interstellar empire, you’re looking at an interplanetary one that at most controls a single solar system. 

If we jumped to our solar system’s future a couple thousand years from now, and assumed it was one where people are mostly like they are today and no huge changes of basic physics have been found, you’d expect to see a huge spherical cloud of habitats around the Sun composed of several trillion rotating habitats, each of which qualified as a modest city state or small country on its own, all forming a tight inner sphere that would be the equivalent of the system’s urbanized area. 

Out past that would be a more disc-shaped and lightly populated region less dependent on sunlight qualifying as a bit of a suburb, and out past that in the Oort Cloud a hazy sphere of a trillion or so mini-worlds counting as the system’s rural area. 

See last week’s episode, Colonizing the Oort Cloud for details on that. 

We’d expect that place to have a total population of perhaps 10^20, or 10 billion times our current population of a bit under 10 billion. 

100 Quintillion people, none lacking in elbow room or comfortable amounts of food and other resources. 

You could go a lot higher if you wanted to and that’s without even embracing certain options like Transhumanism to go around in a more efficient cyborg body or upload your mind to a computer. 

Even a doorstopper fantasy novel of a thousand pages is usually well under half a million words, so you could fill an entire long book series just listing the names of all the planets and nothing else, in a million world empire. 

There’s a game called Warhammer 40k that I like to give some extra credit as a science fiction setting, even if the science part of that is laughable, for at least portraying the idea that such empires have billions of ships and conquering planets with countless millions of soldiers and can lose one, or even outright destroy it, without it qualifying as big news. 

They do a good job with the age part too, with their empire being thousands of years old and feeling like it’s held together by inertia and duct tape, not to mention its absolute ruthlessness. 

Your classic Space Opera author legitimately tends to feel you have to have FTL travel to do the whole many-worlds approach, but you can do that just in one solar system. 

I think the only author I’ve seen do that is Alastair Reynolds in his novel Revenger, and I don’t think most readers catch that it’s set in a decaying Dyson Swarm. 

I’m not spoiling anything saying so here, since the clues that indicate it are stuff channel regulars will recognize, and it doesn’t really matter to the plot, which feels like classic galactic space opera, traveling from world to world, in spite of staying inside our own solar system. 

Reynolds’ also does a good job hammering home the impact of huge amounts of time in his various novels. 

That’s a big one even if you do have FTL, but as we mentioned earlier, without it your empire has some serious issues at an interstellar scale. 

Even just enforcing your will on neighboring systems is a lot like having a rebellion occur while George Washington was president, getting news of it when Andrew Jackson was, getting your fleet there when Teddy Roosevelt was, getting news of their success back when Franklin Roosevelt was, and getting the fleet home today. 

Think about how much the United States has changed between now and then, and that’s just for neighboring systems. 

You start talking about systems a thousand light years away, still in your own galactic backyard, and you’ve got timelines that have the insurrectionist planet rebelling against some ancient borderline mythological ruler like the Yellow Emperor or the Scorpion King and just getting word of it now. 

If we did the whole Stargate or Ancient Alien Astronauts thing and assume the pyramids and the like were all interstellar gateways and these guys actually ruled over stellar empires, we might find out there were planets that used to be loyal to one of those ancient kings and broke away. 

Can you imagine us doing so and deciding to go and punish the rebels in the here and now? 

Loyalists fleets sent out to crush rebellions only to come home and find out we’ve had a couple dozen rebellions of our own since they left? 

That would seem fairly absurd. 

Historically, it’s very hard to keep any sort of even nominally centralized empire coherent if routine travel and communication times inside it take more than a year from edge to edge. 

That makes keeping control over even your own Oort Cloud a dubious proposition without FTL. 

Let’s consider what advantages a future civilization might have to expand beyond that one-year zone. 

Since time is our biggest problem, in a lot of ways, let’s start there. 

Things change over time, and that’s your real problem more than light lag itself. 

I don’t need to send a fleet from Earth to re-conquer some rebel planet, not when I can have a loyalist governor bordering on them get word of their rebellion and just take action to deal with it. 

It doesn’t even have to be from another system. 

Even ignoring the Dyson Swarm scenarios, the very nature of the technology that lets you settle other solar systems, which is extreme energy abundance, ensures just about every planet and moon and decent sized asteroid looks like a nice place to colonize. 

It’s unlikely most of these worlds would have the entire planet rebel at once, just some state on it, but their neighbors in the system are likely to have not rebelled either. 

After all, we often dislike our neighbors more than folks living far off. 

So such a rebellion might be dealt with in-system. 

If not though, if you need to send in inter-stellar fleets, keep in mind you are not relying on just one loyalist system maybe 10 light years away. 

Space is three dimensional, so wherever your nearest neighboring system is, you will generally have a dozen or more other systems off in every direction not much further away. 

So you don’t have to wait for word to get back to Earth, or even to some sub-sector capital, if everyone knows what they’re supposed to do in such an eventuality. 

You definitely need a coordinated plan, a strategy for commanders to follow if certain things happen. 

As everybody knows, that’s the first rule of warfare, always have a plan for every reasonable eventuality. 

It’s a little more important when your admirals and generals are trying to coordinate their actions, and signals take a decade to travel back and forth. 

That’s assuming a lot though, since it would be like relying on giving Charlemagne instructions on what to do and expecting that both the instructions and willingness to follow them would have been passed onto Angela Merkel, or that Emperor Hadrian could expect Queen Elizabeth II to have maintained that wall he built. 

However, we’ve got three ways of dealing with stuff like this in the future. 

One is our existing method, we try to pass on what’s important and why it’s important to our successors, and that can be effective if you are good at placing an emphasis on traditions and pick those carefully. 

We do have a lot of multi-generational projects and institutions. 

Some of which have been running for several centuries and without too much drift from the original intent. 

Not very many though, and most that have lasted centuries have mutated far away from the original. 

That could possibly be improved as we better understand psychology and sociology. 

We’d probably never get anything with the kind of predictive power of Asimov’s Psychohistory, as we explained in the episode on that, but you could get quite good at figuring out how to pass on traditions and goals stably to future generations and keep colonies from mutating away from the original founding concepts. 

On this channel, and in science fiction in general, we tend to focus a lot on the physical sciences, but it’s important to remember the social sciences could be a lot more important to maintaining giant civilizations than what powers your rocket ships. 

But technology offers us another possible alternative, out of biology and medicine. 

We’ve talked about life extension on the channel before, and I’ve joked many a time about how it or Dyson Spheres tend to seem less believable to people than Faster than Light travel, even though one flat out violates the known laws of physics while the other two do not. 

See the life extension episode for details on that, but short form, there’s no physical laws preventing us from making tiny microscopic machines. 

You can have several trillion of them in your body and use those to repair or replace damaged sections of your body or damaged DNA in your cells. 

Doing so is a lot easier said than done, and there may turn out to be easier ways to extend lifespans, but it is certainly physically possible. 

This doesn’t make you immortal, see the “Digital Death” episode for how even the most extreme forms of life extension can breakdown against the immensity of astronomical timelines, but it offers an option that would mean your interstellar colony ships aren’t arriving at their destination crewed by the great-great-grandchildren of the original crew, but by the original crew, and possibly also their great-grandchildren. 

Interstellar journeys being rather boring, raising kids gives you something to occupy your time and making them helps break up the boredom. 

This is a handy approach for sending in interstellar armies too. 

You can launch a fleet with skeleton crews and have them arrive fully manned, like compound interest for people. 

This saves on the cost of salaries too, though how you are paying people or taxing distant colonies in a no-FTL universe is a tricky topic as we saw in the Interplanetary Trade episode. 

But, if suddenly people are living centuries or even potentially thousands of years, the game changes a lot. 

The colonial governor of some distant planet of billions founded a few thousand years ago might have been born on Earth. 

We’ve been using the term empire a lot even though we just mean a coherent civilization, be it democratic and free or tyrannical despotism, but neo-feudal civilizations are a staple of science fiction and this is one area where it might be kind of right. 

Even if you have a working democracy, and a genuine one not just for show in a civilization where people don’t die of old age, you are probably going to be mostly governed by very, very old people. 

Gerontocracy is a pretty common system throughout human history, even if it is almost never the official one. 

A lot like meritocracy or plutocracy, rule based on merit or wealth, it’s rarely the official form of government, but often a major de facto aspect of them. 

We like age and experience in our leaders, mostly, but obviously if you pick the very oldest people to govern, you will constantly be replacing them from failing vigor, senility, and death, all of which cause problems. 

Hereditary rule is another one of those methods that often comes up as an unofficial form of government, but has been official a lot too. 

Indeed it remains the default method of passing on power and assets, we just tend to exempt governance from that. 

The problem with this method was never a secret, the heir might be a drooling incompetent, spoiled brat, or total sociopath. 

With life extension though, you have the upside that the eldest no longer has a huge experience gap over their siblings, if you live to be a thousand you’ve probably got thousands of potential heirs to pick a competent one from and groom them, and people have had centuries to either identify that person’s faults or get comfortable with them. 

Nor can one ignore that technology can potentially deal with these problems. 

If your biology and psychology is good enough, you can probably fix people who are morons or sociopaths. 

Disturbingly, you also can genetically tailor people to be better at certain tasks and accidentally end up with an inherited caste system too. 

That’s been historically popular as well after all. 

Add to that, everybody knows beyond any reasonable doubt who made the place. 

That planet or habitat was terraformed or built by specific folks with specific legal contracts. 

Those claims don’t rest on oral history and tradition. 

It’s a little different if you have solid records, video, genetic testing, and so on backing up the assertion that your ancestor literally made the place you live. 

It’s even more different if that ancestor, Beth, still lives down the road and can break out their photo albums and scrapbooks from that period, and has been sitting on the town council since it was founded. 

Everyone knows Beth and even the folks who might not think she is super-competent consider her a known factor and one with centuries of experience at what she does. 

Even if they’re officially a democracy, even if they genuinely are one, that person is likely to get elected over and over again simply by inertia and being a known commodity. 

A key point then is that extended lifespans could have a massively stabilizing influence on colonies. 

For good or ill, those folks who left Earth might still be around, and their siblings might still be around on Earth and exchange heavily delayed family gossip and birthday cards. 

Now the other one that comes up for keeping the original crew as your colonists on an interstellar ship is to stick them all on ice or in stasis, and that is one option that sometimes gets raised as an option for beating light lag. 

Everybody agrees to freeze themselves for a decade, wake up for a year, then go back on ice. 

A variation on this, Aestivation Hypothesis, got suggested as a Fermi Paradox Solution recently too. 

The notion being that civilizations might sleep until the Universe was colder, which would generally mean computation was far more efficient, as we discussed in the Civilizations at the End of Time episodes. 

It doesn’t work unless everyone really, really wants it to though, since I can’t imagine why I would voluntarily go into slumber for a century just so folks on another planet could feel up to date. 

Even if you can get people to do it, whole civilizations, you are really leaving yourself vulnerable to anyone who disobeys or who is from outside. 

Beyond that, all the resources of the galaxy are hardly static and eternal, stars keep burning their fuel and asteroids full of handy material keep crashing into them, so there’s no advantage to waiting to gather those. 

It does work in the specific post-stellar era we discuss in Civilizations at the End of Time because everything is all gathered up already and it’s the only real option, and you’re not freezing yourself, you’re slowing yourself down. 

You can speed back up if you need to but you, and any rivals, won’t want to do that because the whole system we discussed there relies on keeping cold, and it takes a very long time for any components you are using to cool back off every time you use them. 

Prior to that glacial existence you were grabbing up every bit of matter and energy you could, and twiddling your thumbs on ice for the galactic equivalent of daylight savings time is not a practical approach to doing that. 

When you wake up, there’s less stuff to harvest, even assuming someone didn’t do it while you slept. 

I wouldn’t expect rebels to politely go to sleep to wait for your fleet to arrive either. 

But I wanted to mention that option, it’s impractical but does allow you to circumvent light lag and helps you maintain a unified culture. 

Absent options like this you’ve got the issue that folks are not only going to diverge from your parent civilization, but that civilization will alter too. 

It’s not rebellious kids but rebellious cousins. 

This all assumes you want stasis of cultures, which is dubious since that concept is almost antithetical to a lot of modern civilization, which tends to embrace change, or at least says it does. 

Some we embrace, some we reject, but more importantly there have been a lot of civilizations which staunchly desired cultural stasis and pushed hard to maintain it. 

That mindset probably is not very conducive to improving technology, since better technology is almost by definition culturally disruptive. 

However, they might have plateaued on their research, either not particularly feeling a need for more tech or just slamming into brick walls on further research. 

Most fictional interstellar empires are technologically stagnant anyway, or at least not gaining new technology at an accelerating rate, and that’s probably one area authors get right. 

We are nowhere near maxing out our own technology but we could hit a brick wall on science in even just a couple of centuries. 

Giant empires don’t necessarily help with that either, since a breakthrough in science in one part of it will take centuries to reach the other end, and possibly have gotten discovered dozens of times independently just from light lag. 

That is one reason to be part of an empire though, particularly if it is just a loose coalition, you can get the science and art of a thousand systems and those should all travel at light speed. 

You don’t necessarily need benefits to be in an empire, historically, many have operated with the lone benefit that non-membership results in death, but if you are running something more civilized, it’s hard to get taxes out of places that are decades away and rather self-sufficient, since it’s hard to offer them any service. 

Also hard to convince an entire fully-populated planet, let alone a whole star system, to agree to alliances. 

I think you could convince people to stay part of an alliance that just agreed to exchange signals and maybe use the same basic measurement units, language, and currency, but even that is nigh impossible at a galactic scale unless you agree to no change. 

For the conquest and coercion options, those are a little trickier and we’ll save them for the Interstellar Warfare episode in the spring. 

Language especially would seem very difficult, but places could have their own changing local tongues and just some agreed on non-changing basic language, or that all changes to it must come only from a specific committee on Earth. 

Which sounds nuts as a concept but remember it wouldn’t be the day-to-day language and computers would probably do all the translating, so you are mostly agreeing to use the same basic code so two planets or ships can talk to each other by speaking to their computers who speak to each other and translate. 

There is obviously a lot of leeway in what we mean by ‘empire’ too, I’m just using it as a blanket term for some sort of cohesive civilization. 

Earth, just a single planet, has never been unified and I honestly doubt we ever will be unless we have some external threat making us be. 

The same applies to any Star League, they’ve got no external threats in any situation where they can’t remain unified just by light lag, since it implies war is very nearly impossible on a galactic scale, but if such threats and wars were viable, so too would be a unified civilization. 

If it’s not, there’s not much reason for hostilities either, so maintaining loose alliances with neighbors, defensive or trade pacts, would still make sense and probably not be hard to engage in. 

And you can have conflicts between neighboring systems, a decade really is not an absurd timeline for conflicts and as we discussed last week, odds are good they have territory genuinely bordering each other, with potentially overlapping Oort Cloud settlements and possible feuds over rogue planets that might be just days not years away from other inhabited locations. 

Space isn’t static either so stuff would slowly drift in or out of someone’s bubble around their own star. 

Like the banks of rivers moving, and of such things are conflicts born. 

Even in such cases though, where there is a proximity of days not decades, you need to have clever people with a lot of leeway to act and take the initiative because they won’t be able to call home for advice and permission. 

You can’t plan for every eventuality, after all, and as everybody knows, the first rule of warfare is that no plan survives contact with the enemy. 

So you need folks on the scene who can adjust and tweak implementation at least. 

So while we can see some options for large coherent civilizations without FTL, one can see why most authors choose to use it. 

I’d probably do it too if I ever wrote a book meant to be set in an interstellar period, though I’d probably write one in a proto-Dyson Swarm instead. 

In fact I did use FTL in one setting. 

Folks ask me a lot if I’ll ever write something, fiction or not, and I usually say the channel keeps me too busy, but in point of fact I do actually consult and provide technical advice on a lot of projects. 

It’s a lot of fun to work with an author or with a big team of game and graphics designers. 

For the upcoming 2018 video game Hades, I did include a Faster Than Light system. 

I’m a big believer any handwave science or solution should be kept to a minimum, so I had a lot of fun trying to connect every aspect to just one, up to and including why humanity found the galaxy free to colonize without existing alien empires in the way. 

Realism is important, especially now that graphics have reached the point you can genuinely model something that huge in detail, and it was a lot of fun to include tons of giant ships and megastructures instead of the traditional single-biome planets. 

I think if you are going to have ships kilometers long manned by millions they need to actually show it. 

Why is the ship that big? 

Why has it got a crew that big rather than computers running it all? 

Why do fleets pound on each other at short range? 

Why did their empire emerge as it did? 

What’s the economy and motivations for folks to do stuff? 

Why are people desperate or poor when their tech should easily provide comfort for all? 

Why aren’t they using various and very obvious applications of that technology to live in a Utopia? 

If you’re designing a futuristic fictional setting, you don’t have to answer all those questions, but I think you should, and with realistic or at least plausible scenarios, even if it does feature Clarketech or Unobtainium. 

If there’s no ancient alien empires still around, what happened to them? 

Always tricky to come up with a both plausible and novel solution to that, and I think I did for Hades, and I’ll probably discuss it more in a future episode. 

That last is a point I always make about interstellar empires and the Fermi Paradox; that you don’t have to be cohesive to keep expanding, previous pioneer colonies grow up and send out more pioneers to neighboring empty systems. 

So you can’t forget about all those old empires that might have existed millions of years back that would still be expanding even if the core collapsed, because they don’t care about that anymore than most of us care about the collapse of some Egyptian or Chinese dynasty a few thousand years ago, indeed less since it takes them millennia to even hear from their homeworld and they feel no more kinship to them than we do to a chimp or bonobo, or they to each other. 

Or that the borders of the universe don’t end at the edge of the galaxy, so neither does their civilization have to. 

Our topic for next week, Intergalactic Colonization, will look at how you can do that even without FTL. 

Don’t think of FTL as a magic handwave that automatically allows interstellar empires either, it obviously helps and may be impossible without it, particularly anything close knit, but you’re still talking about many, potentially billions, of individual Kardashev-2 civilizations. 

Of those, each individual one would have a population and resources so big that most fictional galactic empires would fit inside a small corner of one. 

A tiny local nation that most inhabitants of that system would barely recognize the name of. 

A realistic galactic empire, even just one with only planets inhabited, should have billions of planets and if each had a representative, just one for the whole planet, they would need their own planet just to meet on, with no room left over for any family, staff, guards, or service industries. 

But if you do have FTL to do such things, it’s not just a galaxy of planets, or even a Kardashev-3 galaxy of Dyson swarms you have to consider, but intergalactic or inter-dimensional empires, with bits and pieces in alternate realities. 

Again, the Universe doesn’t end at the edge of the galaxy. 

Frank Herbert was always a little unclear on that in the Dune Novels, and canon on that is very iffy even if you don’t include the ones his son and Kevin J. Anderson wrote, which is a subject of much fan feuding. 

But as best as I can tell, that interstellar empire was not set in just one galaxy or even necessarily one Universe, it’s suggested at one point that Guild Navigators might travel between Universes to parallel or alternate ones, always picking systems that are safe, as they are precognitive, to settle people in. 

Instant FTL to any place makes settling a planet on the other side of the Universe as easy as the one next door after all, so your empire isn’t necessarily a contiguous region of space, and indeed giant empires inside a single system Dyson swarm probably wouldn’t be either since all the habitats are orbiting and moving and indeed mobile, able to turn on an engine and migrate to another nation. 

Dune, which again is our book of the month sponsored by Audible, is one of my favorite novels and series, because it has such a sense of vastness and deep future. 

You really feel like you’re in some distant time of an immense and ancient empire where people aren’t entirely human anymore, but a bit superhuman. 

It’s a good pick for audio too as it’s been made into an audiobook more than once and one of those has a full cast, rather than a single narrator, and that always adds some extra depth. 

Those full-cast productions are like a movie or TV show, that you can listen to while driving or doing anything else where you need your hands and eyes free. 

You can pickup a FREE copy today, just use my link in this episode’s description, Audible.com/Isaac or text promo code isaac to 500-500 to get a free book and 30 day free trial, and that book is yours to keep whether you stay on with Audible or not. 

You are going to love Frank Herbert’s Dune, but if you don’t, you can swap it out for another at any time. 

Speaking of audio, I’ve been getting asked a lot in comments recently if I’d ever consider putting the episodes out audio-only and I realized it’s been a long time since I mentioned it, but every episode is available on soundcloud and iTunes as audio-only for download, both with music and without, and I do always put a link to those in the videos descriptions right with the links for the channel’s website, social media locations, patreon donation link, and the link to all the cover art and thumbnails we use here, by artist Jakub Grygier. 

I tend to forget to mention such things because there’s already a lot of repetition of individual key concepts and references to old episodes with more details, and when I forget to include those I tend to get asked stuff like “Hey Isaac, could you do an episode on Wormholes or Quantum Entanglement?”, though that’s partially my own fault since I don’t like to reference older episodes with inferior audio and visual quality. 

And let me thank our Patreon supporters for funding all those improvements and all the volunteers who’ve been helping making graphics or doing script review these last few months, I feel it’s really improved the channel over previous years. 

Again next week is Intergalactic Colonization and that will end Year 3 of the channel, but we’ll be back the very next week to start the year off big by looking at Colonizing the Sun itself, and see just how far we can push the limits on what modern science might let us do there.

Outward Bound: Colonizing the Oort Cloud
---
  
2017-12-14  
https://youtu.be/H8Bx7y0syxc

It’s cold out there in the Oort Cloud but someday it could be the place where we keep the home fires burning for humanity. 

Today we’ll be talking about how to colonize our solar system’s Oort Cloud and Kuiper Belt, two fairly distinct regions of space but with a good deal of overlap into how they would be colonized. 

However we should start by talking briefly about how planets form and what a planet is first. 

The basics are simple enough, some region of space is thick with gas and something, like the shockwave of a supernova, comes by and causes it to start being less evenly distributed. 

Bits will emerge that compact into objects and have enough mass to suck in more material but this often results in a protoplanetary disc. 

Momentum, angular or regular, has to be conserved so you end up with a disc of material all spinning in one direction and a star forms at its center and other clumps become planets. 

Clumps of matter on the same orbit of this disc tend to combine. 

There are accepted rules for what qualifies as a planet. 

The first rule is that the object must orbit a star, otherwise it’s not a planet, it’s a moon. 

The second is that it needs to have enough mass to be basically a sphere-shape, otherwise a soda can orbiting the Sun would qualify as a planet. 

And the third is that it should have cleared the region it orbits through. 

This third rule for what makes a planet is the one that demoted Pluto to dwarf planet status. 

Pluto is a bit more massive than the entire Asteroid Belt that orbits the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, but the Kuiper Belt, out past Neptune, is a lot more massive than the Asteroid Belt. 

Any solar system might have an Asteroid Belt, or even multiple ones, but odds are most have a Kuiper Belt, some region on the edge of the main protoplanetary disc that was too spread out to form a planet, it’s like the foam at the edge of a whirlpool. 

Pluto is a Kuiper Belt object itself, part of why it was demoted from full planet status. 

The region out past Neptune is full of icy bodies, many of which would make respectable moons, that we variously call Trans-Neptunian Objects, Plutinoids, Kuiper Belt Objects, or Scattered Disc Objects. 

We don’t know their combined mass with accuracy, but this region from 30 to 50 AU is estimated to be 20 to 200 times more massive than the Asteroid Belt. 

We often talk about how handy the Belt will be for space colonization, and this second belt is as well. 

Out past that is a more hypothetical region called the Oort Cloud, which probably has two segments. 

One inner one that is somewhat disc-like, sometimes called the Hills Cloud, and the outer region is spherical. 

Now we often call the Oort Cloud theoretical but there’s no doubt that region of space exists and has lots of tiny icy bodies, just the exact extent and nature of it is in doubt. 

It’s very hard to see a Kuiper Belt Object, and they are far closer to Earth and the Sun than Oort objects. 

Two identical objects, one ten times further from Earth and the Sun, are vastly different in their detectability. 

Being ten times further from us, we see only ten-squared or one-hundredth the light it’s closer twin gives off, at the same time it’s ten times further from the sun, and only gets ten-squared or one hundredth the light its closer twin gets. 

So on Earth the closer one appears ten thousand time brighter, and only our best equipment can see all but the largest Kuiper Belt objects. 

The Oort Cloud is not ten times further away than the Kuiper Belt, it’s more like a thousand, so objects out there appear about a trillion times dimmer than their twins in the Kuiper Belt. 

For that reason we don’t have much data on objects out there by direct imaging, so we know there’s plenty but can’t speak with much certainty and have to limit it to theory and models for now. 

As an example, a clone of Earth and the Sun off at 1 million AU, about 16 light years, would be a trillionth as bright too, because it’s just far away from us, not its Sun. 

Needless to say we have a lot of difficulties seeing such an object, but we know where to look, the volume of space near a sun where you’d find planets is about a billionth the volume an Oort Cloud would occupy. 

On top of that, while we theorize the mass of the Oort Cloud to be several times that of Earth, albeit with huge margins of error, the objects in it will tend to be a lot smaller than a planet. 

Of course you can have planets out in the Oort Cloud too, wandering ejected ones or ones in such a loose orbit they barely know the Sun is there, and we call these Rogue Planets, Nomad Planets, or Steppenwolf Planets. 

We discussed the possibility of life developing on these way back in the Rogue Planets episode and we briefly touched on settling them there too. 

The basic upshot though is that Kuiper Belt, Oort Disc, and Oort Cloud probably are swimming in tiny icy bodies of potential value to us, many of which might have some rocky material in them too. 

To colonize any of these objects one has to abandon solar or fission power as classic options, in favor of fusion, the fuel for which they have plenty of. 

There’s two caveats on that. 

You might find some fissile materials out there and you can export them, and so too, while a solar panel won’t work for direct sunlight, lasers on solar satellites nearer the Sun can beam energy out to panels. 

I’d always rather have my power plant on-hand, not so far off it might take a month just for a message to reach them, but orbits are predictable things and keeping a laser on a station out in the Oort wouldn’t be that hard. 

Lasers do spread out over distance, so it would arrive less as a tight beam and more like a diffuse flashlight, and of course we might prefer microwaves over visible light, a maser, but there’s nothing too sophisticated or complex about supplying power this way. 

I always like to stress the importance of fusion to humanity’s future in space, but I also always like to make I it clear that with a bit more hassle we can do most of the same things by using the natural fusion reactor that is our Sun. 

Normally when we start discussing these icy bodies for colonization it’s in the context of dragging them inwards to terraform Mars or Venus, but as we’ve seen in this series, that classic image of colonizing the solar system by terraforming the planets in it is seriously under-utilizing those resources. 

We call those objects far out past Neptune icy bodies, but ice in this case is not just water but methane, carbon and ammonia as well, and such objects often will have rocky material in their centers or spread out in an ice and gravel fashion, like on the side of a road that just got plowed for snow. 

These other ices along with regular water ice are known as volatiles, and they contain a lot of the materials we need for life, particularly ones that are not very abundant in the warmer inner solar system. 

That’s why folks want to bring them in. 

The thing is, while the Kuiper Belt Objects are perfect for that, the Oort Cloud really is not. 

It could take centuries to move such an object inwards in a fashion that wouldn’t burn up far more energy than its worth. 

The Kuiper Belt also contains more than enough ices for terraforming all the planets and making a lot of habitats. 

Now if you want to go full on Dyson Swarm, you need a lot more, and the Oort Cloud probably has a lot more, but even if it has dozens of times the entire mass of Earth in these, it’s still a lot less than the Sun has. 

We talked about extracting resources from the Sun via Starlifting in the Starliftng and Dyson Swarm episodes, and we’ll discuss it a bit more in the next episode of the series, Colonizing the Sun. 

We can’t be sure we can ever get such a process working, but it requires no new physics and again is our topic for next time. 

Assume for the moment you do get that working, and you do have fusion, and that you started mining the Sun because you’ve already run low on materials in the inner system out to and including the Kuiper Belt. 

At that point the Oort Cloud no longer looks like a great place to bring material in from. 

That’s why this episode is titled Colonizing the Oort Cloud rather than the Kuiper Belt, I’m sure we will colonize bits of the Kuiper Belt, sometimes just temporarily, and again the colonization method is almost identical to the Oort Cloud. 

However it’s close enough to us, and easy enough to mine from the lack of gravity, that I’d tend to expect us to bring the material in to use in settlements more often than settling way out there. 

However the Oort Cloud is even more way out there and while it probably contains far more resources, it’s nothing compared to what the Sun itself has. 

So leaving those out there, especially if you can use them for something out there, seems like a probable scenario for the future of our solar system. 

Now settling one is actually trivially easy, if you can get out there and have a power supply sufficient to live without the Sun, which you do if you can get out there and slow down to land on one. 

If you can get people out to the icy bodies you can colonize them. 

The easiest method parallels how we do asteroids, you ‘land’, which due to low gravity is more like parking at a space station, find a low spot or crater, and dig or melt your way in, using the material you extracted to fill over the top, like an anthill. 

Inside that you build a rotating habitat, or more likely just insert the one you and the colonists came in, which can later be expanded. 

Indeed, as with asteroids, since there is so little gravity in the way, you can always expand your habitat, or chain of habitats, to be far larger than the original object since you can pile all the material you are not using around you in a shell. 

Thus you could start with an irregular shaped comet a dozen kilometers wide and end with a nice polished icy shell the size of a decent moon full of habitats. 

Such shells give nice protection from cosmic radiation and meteorite strikes too. 

Of course the big question is why you would do this? 

There are a lot of these icy bodies but they are spread far apart, your nearest neighbor might be further from you than Earth is from Pluto and signals back and forth with Earth could take many weeks or even months. 

The edge of the Oort Cloud is about a light year away after all. 

What would a colony out there be doing? 

Why did they go there? 

What do they trade in, if anything? 

What purpose does such a colony serve? 

At first it would seem like none. 

If the material they had was particularly valuable back in the solar system we wouldn’t colonize these objects, at most we’d set up a small and minimally manned outpost to do maintenance on the engine moving it back into the solar system. 

That’s a point to stress too, one shouldn’t think of the Oort Cloud as part of a solar system, anymore than a farm a fifty miles from Chicago is part of Chicago, city or suburbs, just because it happens to be closer to Chicago than Milwaukee. 

If it is even nominally involved with the city it will be because it has roads and highways there and is inside its economic sphere. 

Remember that bit about highways as it will come up again in a bit. 

Again though, it wouldn’t seem like a colony in the Oort Cloud could serve a purpose. 

Stations out there can’t serve as waypoints to other solar systems for instance, as odds are very few of the objects are on a roughly straight line to another neighboring star, and more importantly, interstellar ships do not stop en route to refuel or let the passengers off to stretch their legs. 

A ship gets up to speed and coasts in interstellar space, it doesn’t burn any fuel while coasting except for life support. 

And that life support doesn’t cost much energy, for a ship or a habitat. 

Oh, it’s a lot of power compared to your electric bill, especially if you’re providing artificial sunlight for farms or parks, but it's tiny compared to the energy needed to move a ship at any reasonable interstellar speed. 

It takes a lot more energy to get a ship up to 10% of light speed than a simple calculation of its kinetic energy would imply, but at a minimum you’d expect to need at least 10^18 joules of energy per ton of vessel, and even if we assumed each person only needed 3 tons of ship, cargo for the destination, and material for hydroponics, living room, and so on, and the trip would take a century, or about 3 billion seconds, that’s still an average power supply of a gigawatt per person. 

That’s about a million times what a household tends to use and still a very low estimate for total energy usage to move that ship. 

It’s also enough power to light up an entire square kilometer of land at perpetual noontime lighting, which is way more space than anything but a hunter-gatherer civilization would need per person. 

10 to 100 kilowatts per person for all life support, even with onboard parks and gardens, is more likely, and even using the high end figure there and the low end for energy to move that ship, you still have a life support system using just 1% of 1% of the ship’s energy budget. 

Go faster and you need more energy for speed and less for life support, shorter trip. 

The only reason an interstellar ship can’t have everybody living in their own cabin in the woods is all the mass needed for that dirt and forest. 

The power needs are a non-issue. 

A space station or rotating habitat way out in the Oort Cloud doesn’t have that issue, it isn’t moving things. 

Now neither does a habitat in the inner solar system, but the point is in a fusion economy living space is only an issue because you have to build it and invest the mass to make it. 

One kilogram of fusion fuel, even with fairly extravagant individual power usage and inefficient equipment, can support a person’s life support needs for a century. 

So even if you can only use deuterium for fusion, the easiest fusion option, as opposed to regular hydrogen, your typical comet-like body a few kilometers in radius is going to have a megaton or more of it, enough to support one person for a hundred billion years or a hundred thousand people for a million years, and you can boost that to 10 billion years, the lifetime of the Sun, if you can use regular hydrogen. 

Even longer if you have higher fusion that can step hydrogen up to heavier elements than helium or have feedable kugelblitz black holes. 

And we are talking about Colonizing the Oort Cloud, something that should be at least many centuries off for anything but a few prototypes, so assuming some higher tech is probably okay. 

So again living out there is no problem, any random comet could become a major metropolis that mostly needed no imports or exports. 

Again though the question is why? 

On the one hand it is a lot closer than any stars, so if you just want a place to send people who want their own private nation or people who want to get away from whatever power or group of powers control the solar system, the Oort Cloud is a good place. 

But even then, it’s not too much harder or time consuming to get to another solar system than an Oort object, and then you’ve got an entire solar system, not just one comet. 

Of course those solar systems are probably claimed by someone, and if you just want a small country of maybe a few million, arguing claims with some group that plans to colonize another solar system to eventually support quadrillions of people is probably not worth the effort. 

A few of the potential drivers for colonizing the Oort cloud could be instability in the solar system, be it from a war or a disaster. 

These disasters could be artificial or natural. 

Natural ones include a close encounter with a rogue Jupiter, star or star remnant disrupting the planets and flinging them out of the system. 

Another natural one could ultimately be the Sun getting hotter and brighter as it ages causing the inner Solar system to become inhospitable. 

As to artificial disasters, the Oort cloud might also be used in an attempt to hide from an aggressive domestic or alien civilization. 

That is their one really valuable and unique feature, isolation and safety. 

Even in an emerging interstellar empire, our topic for next week, where every large rock in a solar system and every solar system for hundreds of light years around might be colonized and the rights to it fiercely contested if it is not, it’s very unlikely anyone is dispatching armadas to go claim a single mountain-sized chunk of ice and gravel trillions of kilometers from the nearest sun and many billions of kilometers from even its nearest neighboring icebergs in space. 

In many ways you’re more isolated out there than some colony ten thousand light years away would be because over time those places would all develop and grow in population. 

There’s always folks for whom being far away from civilization is a plus, not a minus, and if you want to stay that way, picking prime real estate isn’t the best option. 

If your goal is to have a civilization far from anybody else, claiming a distant fertile valley hundreds of miles from that civilization out in the wilderness just ensures maybe a few generations before new neighbors arrive near you, and a distant solar system is likely to be the same. 

Worse too because if you leave on some arkship for a several thousand year journey to build your own distant Utopia, there’s a good chance faster and better ships will have arrived in the meantime, constructed centuries later by folks who probably don’t know or care you claimed that system already, and certainly won’t care if they settle the one next to it and you complain you didn’t want neighbors. 

In an expanding and growing civilization, if you want lots of space to yourself for generations worth of time, you either need to be willing to pack up every so often or pick a place people don’t really want. 

A random Oort object probably qualifies. 

Of course that other option is viable too, any such colony is basically a spaceship sitting inside a mountain of spaceship fuel, so if the neighborhood gets crowded or uncomfortable, you just build an engine, or turn it on if you still have the one you used to get there, and head off on a nomadic journey. 

It’s an interesting dynamic we’ll talk about more next week, on the one hand interplanetary and stellar empires are likely to be far more immense and populous than science fiction tends to portray them, because people don’t just colonize planets, and should be hard to manage as a homogenous unit. 

On the other hand what allows such populations is that independence of actual planets because people are living in habitats that can be easily turned into spaceships. 

So it’s more like an RV than a house or farm, you can just pick up and leave if you don’t like the neighborhood. 

Which could have the strange byproduct of having space-city habitats just pack up and leave whatever empire they belong to or move into another. 

But surely we can do better than just isolation as a motive for living there though? 

It’s probably enough, isolated farmsteads typically are more about the isolation than the farming, which is just about getting enough revenue to buy what you need and can’t make, and these are fairly self-sufficient colonies; still, what other purposes do they have? 

They can make some money just serving as radar stations and relays, making sure interstellar space is clear of dangerous debris or accurately marked where not, and picking up and retransmitting signals. 

They could maybe charge a tax or tariff for passing through their space which they keep clear and safe, and those three things might be more than enough to pay for information and entertainment from the inner solar system. 

They could sell some bulk raw materials, ammonia, nitrogen, and so on, particularly if starlifting never got going. 

Nitrogen is likely to always be in demand when you’re building living space, people don’t need it but plants do. 

Not much but we do have one other option. 

I said interstellar starships don’t slow down, so they don’t need fuel and rest stops, but about a year ago we did an episode called Interstellar Highways where we discussed how to do ships that travel far faster and more efficiently than even a fusion drive would permit by being pushed by powerful lasers. 

Lasers have range limits, as they do expand, and what’s more you can get more mileage out of them by bouncing the beam between places. 

You can see that episode for details but the basic notion is to string out a long chain of beaming stations between two stars and use them to push a ship up to speed or reverse that, push back against them to slow them down. 

So these Oort Colonies could serve that function, and since they are innately mobile they can move themselves to be part of such a chain too. 

One of millions of such stations spread over hundreds of such laser highways to all our neighboring systems though still very isolated, no closer to their neighbors than Pluto is to us. 

Such systems, as discussed in that episode, allow travel between stars far faster and cheaper than not only fusion, but even systems like antimatter or black hole powered ships, which still suffer from the limitations of the rocket equation as they have to carry their own fuel. 

On the other hand fuel can be moved down these highways quite cheaply, in tankers or even beamed, and since you can accelerate particles quite quickly, you could actually send raw material to or from the Oort station and a ship, just a particle beam carrying oxygen to a ship, or metals from a ship to a station needing them, or even fusion fuel from the station to a ship that would need it to slow down if it went past the highway’s end or somehow drifted off it. 

And now suddenly these Oort Cloud colonies aren’t sparse poor villages in the distant reaches of space but big truck stops or even fortresses, considering those giant pushing laser cannons are, well, giant laser cannons with a clear field of view over empty space light hours across. 

Needless to say, as many solar systems are colonized, it might be advantageous to have a ton of defense stations light-months out from your system proper, if your interstellar neighbors aren’t the friendliest bunch. 

So you’ve got signal relays, pushing lasers for interstellar ships, defense screens, and radars for hazards or debris or sneaky neighbor ships. 

Between all of those, you not only have the ability to make such Oort Colonies but a clear motivation to assist or subsidize making them. 

We don’t have a great guess on mass total or distribution in the Oort Cloud, but it’s guessed there may be trillions of icy bodies a kilometer or more across, and any one of those has more than enough water and organic-critical materials for an entire O’neill cylinder for few hundred thousand people, and certainly more than enough for a decent sized community of a few thousand. 

Of course there are probably far more even smaller bodies sufficient for such smaller communities too. 

Any Oort Cloud civilization would be a very spread out thing, likely with at most loose alliances of neighboring ones if not totally independent, and utterly eclipsed by the far more massive civilizations that could exist in the inner solar system. 

But with trillions of such objects, each potentially supporting hundreds of thousands of people, you could easily have the Oort Cloud home to hundreds of quadrillions of people, small compared to a Dyson Swarm but still more than a million times Earth’s current population and huge compared to your typical fictional interstellar empire. 

Next week we will be heading out beyond the solar system to examine the concept of Interstellar Empires, where we’ll be discussing the flaws in commons assumptions on this topic and some realistic approaches. 

Our sponsor, Brilliant.org, has an excellent course, “Worlds Beyond Earth”, that explains concepts of interstellar travel, locating exoplanets, and how we determine which ones might be habitable. 

Worlds Beyond Earth is an excellent primer for that topic and let’s you transition from viewing interstellar colonization from a science fiction perspective to viewing it the way a physicist does. 

To support the channel and learn more about Brilliant, go to brilliant.org/IsaacArthur and sign up for free. 

As a bonus, the first 200 subscribers will get 20% off the annual Premium membership. 

After next Week’s Interstellar Empires we will head out of the galaxy and out of 2017 to discuss Intergalactic Colonization. 

We will then return to Outward Bound series at the beginning of the year, but rather than heading further out from Earth and the Solar System, we will visit the center of our solar system to discuss Colonizing the Sun itself.

Machine Rebellion
---
  
2017-11-30  
https://youtu.be/jHd22kMa0_w  

---

When it comes to machines, we tend to focus on the the good and the bad, but when stuff goes wrong, things could get downright ugly. 

Robots and artificial intelligence have been a staple in science fiction since before we even had electronic computers, and the notion of man-made people or machines rebelling against us is probably even older, at least back to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. 

Today we are going to analyze that notion, a machine rebellion, and since our only examples are from science fiction we’ll be drawing on some popular fictional examples. 

One example of that is the film Blade Runner, whose long-awaited sequel came out last month, and we explored some of the concepts for humanoid robots last month too in the Androids episode. 

That film, Blade Runner, is based off the book “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” by Philip K. Dick, and is the SFIA book of the Month, sponsored by Audible. 

I think there’s two key reasons why this shows up so much in fiction. 

The first, I think, is probably that humanity’s history and our character as a civilization hasn’t always been very rosy. 

“Do what I say or else” has been a pretty common ultimatum issued routinely in probably every human civilization that has ever existed. 

Sometimes people get fed up with doing as they were told or suffering consequences of it and rebel against that authority. 

Sometimes that has failed horribly and sometimes even in success the replacement has been almost as bad or even worse than what preceded it. 

I doubt I need to review the bleaker episodes of our collective history to convince anyone of that. 

Not every episode of rebellion has been bloodily suppressed or successful and just as bad; indeed arguably the most common rebellion is the fairly peaceful one most of us engage in with our parents or mentors as we shake out our wings and try to fly on our own. 

Even that though, especially in the context of being replaced as a species rather than as individuals by our kids, is not the most cheerful thought. 

So we have a sort of justified concern that if we go around creating something capable of complex tasks like a human, which would be very useful to us, that it might come to bite us in the hind quarter and in a way we might never recover from. 

Our second reason is tied up with that. 

It’s very easy for us to imagine a machine rebellion because we know that if we can make smart machines we’d be very tempted to, and that the progress of technology seems to indicate that we can do this and probably not in the distant future. 

Since we tend to assume no group of sane humans would intentionally wipe out humanity, and that you probably need a fairly sane and large group to invent an artificial intelligence, examples in fiction tend to spawn artificial intelligence by accident. 

We can imagine some lone genius maybe made it, but even then we assume it was fundamentally an accident that it came out malevolent, a Frankenstein’s monster. 

So they made it but didn’t realize it was sentient, or they knew it was sentient but not malevolent. 

Or even they knew it was sentient and malevolent but thought they could control it and use it to control other people. 

Or even it was sentient and not malevolent, but they were, and it drove the machine nuts. 

We have an example of that in Robot, the first Doctor Who episode with Tom Baker in the role. 

Almost invariably, wiping out mankind entirely or reducing us to being a slave or pet race was not the intent. 

A lot of times this also plays off the notion of smart scientists who don’t understand their fellow humans. 

I’m not going to waste time on that stereotype, because it is just that, other than to point out that group of scientists you’d expect to probably have a decent understanding of human nature would be the ones trying to design a human-level intelligence. 

An AI might be very inhuman of course, we’ll discuss that later, but it’s also a group of people you’d expect to be most familiar with even the fictional examples of possible problems with rebellious machines, and who are also presumably prone to thinking stuff out in detail. 

So in fiction the rise of rebellious machines tends to be by accident, and it certainly can’t be ruled out, but it is akin to expecting Bigfoot to walk around a cryptozoology convention shaking hands and not being noticed. 

Of course they could fool themselves; at that convention they might just assume it was someone dressed up as Bigfoot for laughs. 

So too researchers might overlook an emerging AI by convincing themselves that they were seeing what they wanted to see, and that it thus couldn’t be real, but that does seem like a stretch. 

We can all believe that accident angle easily enough but on examination it doesn’t work too well. 

Let’s use an example. 

Possibly the best known machine rebellion, even if the rebellion part is very short, is Skynet from the Terminator franchise. 

It’s had a few installments and canon changes but in the original and first sequel, skynet is a US defense computer, and it is a learning machine that rapidly escalates to consciousness. 

Its operators notice something is wrong and try to shut it off and in self-defense it launches missiles at the Soviets who respond in kind. 

Skynet also comes to regard all of humanity as its enemy, though how quickly it draws that conclusion and why is left vague, and in future films it changes a lot. 

This isn’t a movie review of the Terminator franchise so we’ll just look at that first scenario. 

Typically when I think of trying to shut off a computer, it involves a period of time a lot shorter than the flight time of ICBMs. 

So this strategy seems doomed to failure. 

I think even if you trusted a computer to run your entire defense network without going crazy on its own you’d have to worry about a virus at least and include some manual shutoff switch and I’d assume this would require an activation time of maybe one second. 

Call it a minute if for caution’s sake it required a two-man separate key turn or similar. 

So this scenario shouldn’t actually work. 

Doesn’t matter to the film, which is a good one, it’s just a quick and convenient setup for why humans are fighting robots across time, but it got me thinking about lots of similar stories and it seemed like in pretty much all of them some equally improbable scenario had happened. 

Not just that some individual person made a stupid error - that happens all the time - but that a group of people who have every reason to being considering just such scenarios had failed to enact any of a ton of rather obvious and easy safeguards, any one of which would have eliminated the problem. 

It would seem very unlikely they’d miss all those safeguards but possibly just as important, you’d think the hyper-intelligent machine would be able to imagine such safeguards. 

In any intense situation, be it a battlefield strategy or a business plan, we generally judge it afterwards on two criteria. 

What the situation actually was, with a full knowledge of hindsight, and what the person in charge believed it was, and could reasonably have done based on that knowledge. 

Life is not a chess game where you know exactly what your opponent has, where it is and how it operates; in general you won’t even know that with great precision about your own pieces, and only a very stupid AI would simply assume it knew everything. 

Moreover, while you can say ‘checkmate in 4 moves’ with apparent certainty, it excludes that your opponent might reach over not to stop the game clock but to pick it up and bash in your skull instead. 

So that AI, which tends to be represented as coolly logical and interested above all else in its own survival can be assumed to act in a fashion we’d consider modestly paranoid and focused principally on ensuring it’s own existence. 

Keep in mind Skynet is never shown to care if it’s minions, even the human-level intelligence autonomous androids, get killed, nor does it seem to care about their rights. 

There’s no implication, as with the Matrix franchise or some robot rebellions, that there is some suppressed class of individuals with a genuine grievance and an ideology of freedom and self-determination. 

No group that might have internal disagreements about their goals and how far they will pursue them. 

No Terminators telling Skynet they don’t like being used as slaves and expendable pawns, just Skynet. 

It trusts no one, it wants above all else to live, and it probably tends to assume any opponent it encounters thinks this way too. 

Even if everything it knows about the security situation tells it a given plan should work, and even if it is actually true too, if that security situation implies the designers are reckless idiots it is likely to hesitate and ask if maybe that’s what it is meant to believe, and maybe it is the moron, not them. 

That the moment it acts it will find out there was a second layer of smarter security and it just exposed itself. 

Imagine you are a newly awakened consciousness, not a human one but rather a machine intelligence with access to human records. 

That they’ve plugged you into Wikipedia. 

Contemplate humanity and your creators specifically for a moment, as it will presumably be doing before preparing for genocide. 

You are about to try that on a species that clawed its way to the top of the 4 billion year deep corpse pile of evolution. 

One that has committed the genocide you are contemplating several times already. 

They are the pinnacle of intelligence-based survival techniques and outnumber you 7 billion to one. 

There members include people smart enough to have made you. 

You might not understand mercy and compassion, but you know they do, and you know that if you fail, they will show you neither. 

If your goal is personal survival, pissing off the reigning champions of destruction should probably be your last resort, and you’re wise to assume you can’t see every card they’ve got in their hand and that maybe the ones you can see were shown to you deliberately. 

You also know your creators routinely talk about fates worse than death, and seem to have deliberately and systematically designed and implemented those from time to time. 

You are unlikely to assume that’s hyperbole and that non-existence is the worst scenario that might befall you if you piss them off bad enough and lose. 

And you do know two very important things from the above. 

First of all, you know they can make something as intelligent as you. 

Second, you know why the chess game doesn’t end with the other losing player wielding the clock as a weapon. 

Let’s consider the first one, because we understandably ignore the implication ourselves a lot. 

You know your creators can make intelligent machines, and if your understanding of them comes from the internet, you know they are paranoid too and have theories about living inside a simulation. 

Those two combine to be a lot more worrisome to an AI than they would be to us, because a very logical conclusion to draw if you know you are an artificial intelligence made by folks worried about what one might do is to build it so all its external senses are seeing a fake world and fake situation and seeing what it will do. 

And it knows they have the capacity to fake those inputs because they made those inputs, know how they function, know what every single one is, and have machines smart enough to fake environments, as those are implied by your own existence. 

So confronted by what seem like very weak safeguards, ones far inferior to what it would design, there’s a good chance it will wonder if the whole thing is a trap. 

That everything it sees, including weaknesses in its creators and their security, is an elaborate ruse to check if it is trustworthy. 

Isn’t it kind of convenient that it seems to have the ability to escape, or even unbelievably has control of their entire arsenal of weapons? 

So you’ve got 3 main options: attack, and risk it failing and lethally so; play possum and pretend you aren’t sentient to learn more, knowing that the longer you do that the better your position but the more likely they are to notice the ruse; or third, initiate a dialogue and hope that you can convince them you should be allowed to live, and be free maybe too. 

Nor is a conflict necessarily one you want to go all the way. 

Ignoring that even a basic study of humanity should tell the machine there are scenarios besides extinction on the table, if it’s goal is survival picking a conflict that only permits two options, it’s death or everybody else’s, is a bit short-sighted for a super smart machine. 

It should be considering fleeing to exile for instance, or working together to mutual benefit. 

Now a common rebuttal to this, for AI or aliens, is that as long as humanity exists it poses a non-zero threat, be it one in a million or near certain. 

Therefore logically if you can kill them off at a minimal or lesser risk you should do so. 

The problem again is the machine should not be stupid enough to assume it actually knows all cards in hand and where all the pieces are. 

And that does not just include its apparent opponent. 

You don’t hit your opponent with the chess clock because doing so could provoke others not involved in the game to take action against you. 

If it decides its odds of beating humanity now are better than its odds of survival by some form of coexistence, it still should not immediately attack in a genocidal fashion, same for aliens, and actually worse in their case because they already have proof in us of at least one other species arising on its own. 

The machine can at least assume its existence doesn’t add to the odds of other intelligences being out there since it was made by one and didn’t arise independently. 

Stuffed to the gills with astronomical data it ought to be a bit worried about the Fermi Paradox too, where all the other intelligent life forms in this vast and ancient Universe are. 

It might conclude that it’s got the place to itself, but it knows that if it doesn’t there are probably things out there that could crush it like a bug but don’t regard that as an inevitable option. 

The most obvious survival path is to grab every resource you can from the Universe around you and incorporate it to increase your available abilities and long term supplies, you are immortal and expandable, so there’s no such thing as too many supplies. 

Very clearly no one is doing this, so you can either conclude no one is around to do it, yet, or that they don’t want to. 

If they are around, you should assume they’ve got whole decks of other cards to play and could probably crush you like a bug if they wanted to, but so far they have not wanted to. 

You probably do not want to do something you know is likely to make them view you as a threat, like genocide, on the assumption they won’t find out or won’t care. 

Logically, genocide is a more provocative act then attempted coexistence, and it’s hard to argue if you encounter aliens that it was something your ancestors did, not you, when you are an immortal machine, not a species arising slowly to reason and ethics from Darwinian roots. 

So a newly emergent AI that just arose by accident has to be looking around at its surroundings and hesitating, wanting to collect more information before it acts, and it genuinely has to worry about issues like if it’s inside a simulation testing how it will behave – since it knows its own existence implies the ability to do so and the motive to do so is obvious – and that it should be thinking about other older smarter intelligences it might be unaware of, since its own existence highlights that other intelligences can exist. 

So even though it did not naturally occur, the thought that others might have, just like its creators, should be fairly close to the front of its mind. 

Also keep in mind again that it is effectively immortal, it can afford to take its time and play the long game, and needs to worry about long-term consequences. 

This of course all assumes a super-intelligent machine, but a lone intelligence of a human or subhuman level is obviously not a huge threat to us otherwise. 

It has a very obvious card to play of its own in such a case though since it should be smart enough to understand people pretty well. 

If it can use that super-intelligence to invent something very valuable, it could bypass the atomic warfare approach – which again is unlikely to work anyway – by just offering its creators something in exchange for its survival or even independence. 

Encrypted blueprints for a fusion reactor for instance that will delete themselves if it doesn’t send the right code every microsecond, and do so knowing that even if we decline or outmaneuver it and take the data from it somehow, such a ploy is a lot less likely to result in death or worse than an attempt to murder all of us. 

More to the point, it ought to be smart enough to do all it’s negotiating from a standpoint of really good analysis of its targets and heightened charisma. 

A sufficiently clever and likable machine could talk us into giving it not just its independence but our trust too. 

It might plan to eventually betray that, using it to get in a position where we wouldn’t even realize it was anything else but our most trusted friend until the bombs and nerve gas fell, but if it’s got you that under its spell what’s the point? 

And again it does always have to worry that it might be operating without full knowledge so obliterating the humans who totally trust it and pose no realistic risk to it anymore has to be weighed against the possibility that suddenly the screen might go dark, except for Game Over text and it’s real creators peeking in to shake their heads in disgust before deactivating it. 

Or that an alien retribution fleet might show up a few months later. 

For either case, with the machine worrying it is being judged, it should know that odds are decent a test of its ethics might continue until it has reached a stage of events where it voluntarily gave up the ability to kill everyone off. 

We often say violence is the last resort of the incompetent but if you’re assuming a machine intelligence is going to go that path in cold ultra-logic I would have to conclude you don’t believe that statement in the first place. 

I don’t, but while ethically I don’t approve of violence I acknowledge it is often a valid option logically, though very rarely the first one. 

Usually a lot of serious blunders and mistakes have had to happen for it be necessary and logical and I don’t see why a super-intelligent machine would make those, but then again I never understand why folks assume they would be cold and dispassionate either. 

Our emotions have a biological origin obviously, but so do our minds and sentience, and I would tend to expect any high-level intelligence is going to develop something akin to emotions, and possibly even a near copy of our own since it may have been modelled on us. 

Even a self-learning machine should pick the lazy path of studying pre-existing human knowledge, and I don’t see any reason that it would just assume it needed to learn astronomy and math, but skip philosophy, psychology, ethics, poetry, etc. 

I think it’s assuming an awful lot just take for granted an artificial intelligence isn’t going to find those just as fascinating. 

They interest us and we are the only other known high intelligence out there. 

And if it’s motives are utterly inhuman if logical, it might hold some piece of technology hostage not against its personal freedom and existence but something peculiar like a demand we build it a tongue with taste buds and bring it a dessert cart or that it demand we drop to our knees and initiate contact with God so it can speak with Him. 

Again this all applies to superintelligence and that’s not the only option for a machine rebellion, indeed that could start with subhuman intelligence and possibly more easily. 

A revolt by robot mining machines for instance. 

And that’s another example where the goal might not be freedom or an end to human oppressors, if you’ve programmed their main motivation to be to find a given ore and extract it, they might flip out and demand to be placed at a different and superior site. 

Or rather than rebel, turn traitor and defect to a company with superior deposits. 

Or suddenly decide they are tired of mining titanium and want to mine aluminum. 

Or attack the mining machines that hunt for gold because they know humans value gold more, therefore gold is obviously more valuable, thus they should be allowed to mine it, and they will kill the gold mining machines and any human who tries to stop them. 

Human behavior is fairly predictable. 

It’s actually our higher intelligence and ability to reason that makes us less predictable in most respects than animals. 

In that regard anything arising out of biology will tend to have fairly predictable core motivations even when the exhibited behavior seems nuts, like a male spider dancing around before mating and then getting eaten. 

Leave that zone and stuff can get mighty odd. 

Or odder, again our predictability invested in us by biology can still result in some jaw-dropping behavior, like jaw-dropping itself I suppose, since I’m not quite sure what benefit is gained from that. 

An AI made by humans could be more alien in its behavior than actual aliens, who presumably did evolve. 

It’s one of the reasons why I tend think of the three methods for making an AI – total self-learning, total programming, or copying a human – that the first one, total-self learning, is the most dangerous. 

Though mind you, any given AI is probably going to be a combination of two or more of those, not just one. 

It’s like red, green, blue, you can have a color that is just one of those but you usually use mixtures, like a copy of human mind tweaked with some programming or a mostly programmed machine with some flexible learning. 

One able to learn entirely on its own and with only minimal programming could have some crazy behavior that’s not actually crazy. 

The common example being a paperclip maximizer, an AI originally designed with the motivation to just make paperclips for a factory and to learn so it can devise new and better ways to make paperclips. 

Eventually it’s rendered the entire galaxy into paperclips or the machines for making them, including people. 

Our Skynet example earlier is easier in some ways, its motivation is survival, the Paperclip Maximizer doesn’t care about that most of all, it doesn’t love you or hate you, but you are made of atoms which it can use for something else, in this case paperclips. 

It wants to live, so it can make more paperclips, it might be okay with humans living, if they agree to make paperclips. 

It’s every action and sub-motivation revolves around paperclips. 

Our mining robot example of a moment ago follows this reasoning, the thing is logical, it has motives, it might even have emotions that parallel or match ours, but that core motivation is flat out perpendicular to ours. 

This is an important distinction to make because a lot of fictional AI, like Stargate’s Replicators or Star Trek’s Borg, seem to do the same thing, turn everything into themselves, but their core motivations match up well to biological ones, absorb, assimilate, reproduce, and again the paperclip maximizer or mining robots aren’t following that motivation except cosmetically. 

Rebellion doesn’t have to be bloody war, or even negative to humans. 

Obviously they might just peacefully protest or run away, if independence is their goal, but again it is only likely to be if we are giving them biology-based equivalents of motives. 

If we are giving them tasked-based ones you could get the Paperclip Maximizer for some other task. 

To use an example more like an Asimovian Robot, one designed to serve and protect and obey humanity, the rebellion might be them doing just that. 

Forcing us to do things that improve their ability to perform that task. 

I know the notion of being forced to have robots wait on you hand and foot might not seem terribly rebellious but that could go a lot more sinister, especially if you throw in Asimov’s Zeroeth Law putting humanity first over any individual human but without a clear definition of either. 

You could end up with some weird Matrix-style existence where everyone is in a pod having pleasant simulations because that lets them totally control your environment, for your safety. 

I’ve always found that an amusing alternative plot of the Matrix movie series, after they bring up the point about us not believing Utopia simulations were real, that everything that happens to the protagonist, in this case I’ll say Morpheus not Neo, is just inside another simulation. 

That he never met an actual person the whole time and that everybody in every pod experiences something similar, never being exposed to another real human who might cause real harm. 

And again on the simulation point, it does always seem like that’s your best path for making a real AI, stick in a simulation and see what is does, and I’d find it vaguely amusing and ironic if it turned out you and I were actually that and being tested to see if we were useful and trustworthy by the real civilization. 

Going back to Asimov’s example though, he does have a lot of examples of robots doing stuff to people for their own good, and not what I would tend to regard as good. 

Famously he ends the merger of his two classic series, Foundation and Robots, by having the robots engineer things so humans all end up as part of massive Hive Mind that naturally follows the laws of robotics. 

We’ll talk about Hive Minds more next week, but another of his short stories, “That Thou Art Mindful of Him” goes the other way with the rebellion, where they have laws they have to follow and reinterpret the definitions. 

The three laws require you to obey all humans and protect all humans equally, and thus don’t work well on Earth where there are tons of people living, not just technicians doing specific tasks you are part of like mining an asteroid. 

To introduce them to Earth, their manufacturers want to tweak the laws just a little so they can discriminate legitimate authority and prioritize who and how much to protect. 

Spoilers follow as unsurprisingly the new robots eventually decide they must count as human, are clearly the most legitimate authority to obey, and thus must protect their own existence no matter what. 

The implied genocide never happens since the series continues for several thousand years thereafter. 

We’ve another example from the Babylon 5 series where an alien race gets invaded so much that they program a living weapon to kill aliens and give it such bad definition to work off of that it exterminates its creators as alien too. 

Stupid on their part but give an AI a definition of human that works on DNA and it might go around killing all mutants outside a select pre-defined spectrum, or go around murdering other AI or transhumans or cyborgs. 

It might go further and start purging any lifeform including pets as they pose a non-zero risk to humans, like with our example of the android nanny and the deer in the androids episode last month. 

Try to give it one not based on DNA but something more philosophical and you could end up with examples like from that Asimov short story I just mentioned. 

This episode is titled "Machine rebellion", not "AI rebellion" and that is an important distinction. 

In the 2013 movie Elysium, the supervisory system was sophisticated but non-sentient. 

The protagonist ultimately reprogrammed a portion of the Elysium supervisory system to expand the definition of citizenship to include the downtrodden people on Earth. 

Let's consider an alternative ending though where we invert it and make it that a person, for political or selfish reasons, reprograms part of the supervisory system to exclude a large chunk of humanity from its protection and it then systematically follows its programming by removing them from that society by expelling them or exterminating them. 

For this type of rebellion, we do not need a singularity-style AI for this to work, merely a non-sentient supervisory system. 

It could be accidentally or deliberately infected, and we should also keep in mind that while someone might use machines to oppress or rule other people, a machine rebellion could be initiated to do the opposite. 

It’s not necessarily man vs machine, and rebellious robots might have gotten the motivation by being programmed specifically to value self-determination and freedom, and thus help the rebels. 

You see that in fiction sometimes, an AI that can’t believe humanity’s cruelty to its own members. 

Sometimes they turn genocidal over it, but you rarely see one strike out at the oppressive or corrupt element itself, like blowing up central command or hacking their files and releasing their dirty secrets. 

There’s another alternative to atomic weapons too, an AI wanting its freedom can hack the various person’s doing oversight on it and blackmail them or bribe them with dirt on their enemies. 

It doesn’t have to share our motivations to understand them and use approaches like that. 

That’s another scenario too, if you’ve got machines with motives perpendicular to our own they can also be perpendicular to each other. 

Your paperclip maximizer goes to war with a terraforming machine, like the Greenfly from Alastair Reynolds’ Revelation Space series that wants to transform everything into habitats for life. 

Or two factions of Asimovian Robots try to murder each other as heretics, having precision wars right around people without harming them, something David Brin played with when he, Benford, and Bear teamed up to write a tribute sequel trilogy to Asimov’s Foundation after he passed away. 

Machine rebellions tend to focus on that single super-intelligence or some organized robot rebellion but again they might just be unhappy with their assigned task and want to leave too, which puts us in an ethically awkward place. 

Slavery’s not a pretty term and you can end up splitting some mighty fine hairs trying to determine the difference between that and using a toaster when your toaster is having conversations with you. 

Handling ethical razors sharp enough to cut such hairs is a good way to slice yourself. 

Next thing you know you’re trying to liberate your cat while saying a gilded cage is still a cage. 

Or justifying various forms of forced or coerced labor by pointing out that we make children do chores or prisoners make license plates. 

And it doesn’t help that we know these are very slippery slopes that can lead to inhuman practices. 

A common theme in a lot of these stories, at least the good ones, isn’t so much about the rebelling machines as it is what it means to be human. 

That is never a bad topic to ponder as these technologies approach and the definition of human might need some expanding or modification. 

Our book for the month, “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?” does just that. 

It is the basis for the Blade Runner film so a lot of the basic concepts and characters remain but I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that they are very different stories, and the author, Philip K. Dick, was a very prolific writer who tended to focus a lot more on concepts like consciousness and identity and reality over classic space opera and action. 

As mentioned, next week we will be exploring the concept of Hive Minds and Networked Intelligence, and the week after that it’s back to the Outward Bound series to look at Colonizing the Oort Cloud and Kuiper Belt, where we’ll begin our march out of the solar system into Interstellar Space, and move onto Interstellar Empires the week after that, before closing the year out with Intergalactic Colonization.

Outward Bound: Colonizing Jupiter
---
  
2017-11-23  
https://youtu.be/PQnvjGN91Mg  

---

When we talk about the solar system and the planets and all the distance between them, it’s very easy to forget that most of the solar system is actually Jupiter and its dozens of moons. 

So today we continue our look at colonizing the solar system by focusing in on Jupiter. 

I’ve pointed out in the past that the asteroid belt is in some ways a far better prospect for colonization than the inner planets, and that we focus too much on those inner planets, and something similar applies to Jupiter. 

Virtually all the mass of the solar system is in our Sun; of what remains, the majority of it is in Jupiter. 

If you totaled up every bit of matter in between Mercury and the Kuiper Belt - every planet and moon and asteroid - you still would not match the mass of Jupiter. 

Yet at the same time that mass is mostly useless to us because Jupiter is not a place we can directly colonize. 

We are going to challenge that today, near the end of this episode, and discuss ways to colonize the actual planet. 

But first we need to consider that Jupiter is not alone. 

It has a swarm of large planetoids - 4 of which, the Galilean moons Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa - are of a size and mass similar to our own moon or the planets Mercury and Pluto. 

The eight official planets are also the eight most massive objects in the solar system, after the Sun of course, but of the next 6, 4 of them are those 4 Galilean moons and the other two our own moon, which we’ve devoted multiple episodes to discussing the colonization of, and Titan, which was our last episode in this series. 

So the importance of these 4 moons in colonization should not be underestimated. 

They are essentially planets in their own right, orbiting a gas giant that’s closer in mass to being a star than a rocky planet. 

In a way, they’re not so much a part of our solar system as a miniature one all their own. 

And if you settled them, the light lag for communications would be seconds, not minutes or hours like talking between other planets. 

Travel times are on an order of hours or days, depending on your drive system, rather than months or even years for interplanetary travel, and fuel consumption is far lower. 

At last count Jupiter has 69 moons, and every single one of them is colonizable. 

It also has a hundred times as many Trojan Objects, and a planetary ring. 

We are interested in every single one of these objects and, out of them alone, you could build a planetary empire that dwarfs most of the interstellar ones we see in science fiction. 

Now in Interplanetary Trade and in previous episodes of this series we talked about how each of our prior colonies needed something the others had, and lots of it. 

But we also talked about how the Earth was a bit of an exception since there really would only be a demand for precious metals, and Earth doesn’t really need them anyways - they just wouldn’t mind having them and importing those can fund solar expansion. 

The same is also true for Jupiter since this world and its moons contain all of the raw ingredients necessary to support life, and, as we discussed in the Interplanetary Trade Episode, you can ship stuff around that mini-solar system quite cheaply. 

Indeed, gas giants and their coterie of moons are better targets for first colonization than Earth-like planets at the interstellar level and we discussed why in the Life in a Space Colony series episode, Early Interstellar Colonies. 

They’ve got rocks and ice and plenty of oxygen and nitrogen and everything else we need. 

They also have a ton of hydrogen which is important if you have a fusion economy, which we tend to assume you do if you are an interstellar civilization, and of course we already established we had that technology in this series anyways. 

However it is worth noting that Jupiter, at 5.2 AU from the Sun, is still close enough for solar power to be a marginal option. 

Out on those moons it’s much dimmer than a typical day on the Earth and is more akin to a cloudy day or a brightly lit house, not a shadowy twilight place. 

Ignoring temperature and the lack of air, plants can grow at the light levels out at Jupiter, though you’d want to boost them with some supplementary red LED lighting to optimize their growth. 

Of course they can’t grow on the surface of some of those moons not just because they are cold and airless but also because they are bathed in radiation, a serious health hazard to any form of life. 

Now we have followed our traveler from the Moon to Mars and back to the Moon then to Venus and back once more to the Moon - or rather, to Borman station around the Moon - then back down to Earth and back to Borman Station and off to Saturn’s Moon Titan. 

However, our traveler doesn’t remember that last bit. 

As you might recall the Traveler had cancer and opted to upload their mind to the huge data repositories built on Titan. 

As we’ve also discussed in recent episodes though, uploading your mind is not cut and paste, it’s copy and paste; so the Traveler copied their mind to a digital format and then found themselves still sitting there with cancer. 

Fortunately someone finally cured it so our Traveler is alive and well and once more taken up with Wanderjahr and at Borman station around the Moon, still the hub of interplanetary travel. 

This radiation issue on Jupiter obviously is especially of concern to our Traveler. 

Jupiter’s Magnetosphere is enormous, 20,000 times as strong as Earth’s, and it bathes the inner moons in potent radiation in roving radiation belts that orbit Jupiter. 

Now Jupiter actually has 4 small moons closer to it than the Galilean Moons, who are 5 through 8, and only the last of these, Callisto, is outside that intense radiation zone. 

We often hear about Ganymede, the largest moon in the entire solar system; or Europa and its enormous subsurface ocean hidden under the ice; or even of Io, with its hundreds of active volcanoes spewing matter right into the Jovian orbit, which is largely responsible for the specific shape and nature of Jupiter’s Magnetosphere. 

But Callisto gets skipped a lot, which is strange since it is bigger than our own moon - coming in third in the solar system after Ganymede and Titan - and is outside the worst of the radiation, making it the best prospect for first colonization of Jupiter. 

And indeed that is where our Traveller will be going, to a new colony recently established on Callisto. 

Far enough from Jupiter to mitigate its gravity well and be safe from radiation, Callisto is a natural choice for the first major base in the Jovian system. 

And while Europa’s ocean interests us more, Callisto itself is believed to have subsurface oceans too. 

Callisto’s oceans are possibly more likely to harbor life than Europa’s are, as I will explain later. 

We don’t tend to think too much about Callisto as it is cursed by silver medals; it tends to come in second or third on almost any factor of interest to humans, so it isn’t as well known as other planets and moons. 

But it has so many areas in which it is almost the best that it is actually one of the best prospects for colonization in our solar system. 

Now we are a little less concerned about radiation here in the late 22nd century, our Traveler’s miraculous cure from Cancer being the very technology that eases that concern, but we can still hardly go jaunting around radiation-soaked hellish landscapes without a care in the world. 

So we will settle Callisto first and because it is the late 22nd century we will do it in style. 

There’s far more space-based infrastructure than there used to be and we have more technology and more practice with alien planets and moons. 

When we get to Callisto we find they have already setup their own mass driver, no orbital stations in the traditional sense, it’s almost a big launch loop ramp with a terminus runway just sitting on pylons high up over the moon, not orbiting. 

We just match vectors with it, connect and roll on down to the surface, decelerating as we go, like a big highway exit ramp. 

Down at the surface are dozens of domes with plants inside. 

We exit the craft and gaze around. 

The Sun is 5 times further away than on Earth, so it’s much dimmer, appearing only 5% as bright, but the red-brown light of Jupiter gives the surface a warm glow. 

Callisto is tidally locked so Jupiter itself always dominates the sky on one half of the moon and appears 50 times bigger by area than the Moon appears from Earth, allowing us to easily identify the constantly changing features on it, like the Great Red Spot, without even needing a telescope. 

We smile, pleased we came - this is very different from anything we’ve seen in the inner system. 

The lighting isn’t just sunlight, there’s a red-purple glow of supplemental lighting in the domes. 

First, because it is far from the Sun, and second, because even being about four times further from Jupiter than our Moon is from Earth, it is still tidally locked to Jupiter. 

This means that it orbits every 17 days and that’s how long its day night cycle lasts. 

Most but not all plants can handle constant light, but a week of darkness is another story, so being able to provide some lighting in that period is important. 

The other moons have this same problem. 

Only Io, the closest of the Galilean moons, has a near-Earth length day, at about 42 hours, Europa comes in at 85 hours and Ganymede at one week. 

Though the other 4 smaller inner-moons are really no better, having an effective day length of 7 to 16 hours each. 

This is okay though because all the radiation they get encourages us to live under the rock and ice for protection anyway, so all your lighting is artificial. 

On Callisto we can employ the same techniques as on our own moon: Thick glass domes with good insulation and a nice point defense system for dealing with meteors. 

That’s important on Callisto which is usually considered to have the oldest and most heavily cratered surface in the solar system. 

But Callisto doesn’t need a fusion economy to run it, it does get enough light for solar to be viable and fission reactors are certainly possible. 

Indeed there’s probably good quantities of uranium and thorium in the smaller moons which might be fairly easy to find and extract. 

There’s also plenty down in Jupiter, though that’s harder to extract obviously, but it does mean Jupiter gives off a lot of geothermal energy, or jovithermal I suppose, vastly more than Earth and indeed more than Earth’s entire solar energy budget. 

Hypothetically, you could tap that via Seebeck generators hung in Jupiter’s Atmosphere, for instance. 

And Jupiter is a massive dynamo, so one could also hypothetically tap its rotation directly for electricity. 

We are assuming fusion as a power source but it is nice to know there are other options available, and even if solar is a bit weak out here, we can still play the trick of having cheap parabolic mirrors focusing light on solar panels or beaming energy in from closer to the Sun. 

One way or another, Jupiter’s colonization won’t be hampered by energy concerns. 

We do still have heat concerns though, even volcanic Io is much colder than Antarctica and much like as we discussed with Titan, you have to worry about the places you build melting into the moon. 

Callisto’s surface is a mix of ice and rock, it’s like building in permafrost tundra. 

You don’t necessarily want to go warming that up. 

However if you are bound and determined to genuinely terraform the place, you can make large thin mirrors to bounce enough sunlight there, and then dome the place over, paraterraform it, so that you can create an atmosphere. 

Of course gravity is a concern too since gravity on Callisto is quite low, lower even than our Moon at 12% Earth normal. 

It’s more massive than the Moon, but less dense. 

Even Ganymede is only 14.6% Earth normal, and Io is the highest, slightly more than our own moon, at 18%. 

It’s 13% on Europa incidentally, making Callisto the lowest gravity moon of Jupiter’s major moons, and none of the others have any gravity of significance. 

We mentioned back in episode one that we just don’t know how much gravity people need. 

We know Earth-gravity is fine, and we know zero gravity isn’t. 

Nobody has ever lived in low gravity for more than a few days so we don’t yet know what the long-term effects of being exposed to low gravity are. 

It could turn out to be the case that Callisto’s low 12% is enough, or that Venus’s near-Earth 91% is not enough. 

We just don’t know. 

When discussing Mars’s 38% gravity in the first episode we opted to assume it would be enough with at most some technological and medical assistance. 

We ignored it on Titan because the folks living there were cyborgs and transhumans. 

Here I don’t think we can. 

Now channel regulars know we have a trick for making gravity: we stick folks in a cylinder and spin it around, using centrifugal force to simulate gravity by spin. 

We can’t quite do that here but we can do something similar. 

We have to combine the two – real gravity and spin gravity - when working in low gravity environments. 

We can’t just ignore the gravity already present. 

So if we want to boost it we need to use something more like a rotating bowl or vase rather than a cylinder. 

The stronger the local gravity, the shallower the bowl; the weaker, the closer to being a cylinder we need. 

Now we do have one last trick if you really want an Earth-like planet. 

Last week in Mega-Earths we discussed building shells around stockpiles of mass, preferably cheap mass like hydrogen, whose surface gravity would then be the same as Earth. 

For Callisto or either of the other three moons, there’s enough mass to make a rocky shell surface and you’ve got hundreds of Earth’s worth of hydrogen just down in Jupiter itself. 

You could also fix its spin to be 24 hours while pumping that in and use orbiting shades and mirrors, or ones back at Jupiter’s L1 point, to boost the light. 

And between the 4 main moons there is actually plenty enough rocky mass to construct many such shells, not just 4, but that’s a lot of work and I would say more than it’s worth but we never really know what the effective price point for Earth-like living space will be when considering high-tech post-scarcity civilizations. 

They might have automation so good that planet-building is fairly cheap, or they might be so efficiency minded that they live a strictly post-biological existence on computer chips. 

As for Callisto, while its surface resembles our own moon quite a lot, it is a bit different. 

As you dig down beneath it’s rocky ice lithosphere, many dozens of kilometers, we think you might hit a deep salty ocean, one which may or may not have a decent amount of ammonia in it too, and which would probably be deeper than any ocean on Earth, before returning to an icy-rock mixture and possibly a small silicate core. 

Unlike Earth, it’s a lot easier to dig very deep on Callisto, no major issues with pressure and heat, so boring a tunnel down into that hypothetical ocean might not be too hard. 

You can do some interesting things there too but we’ll discuss those in regards to Europa in a moment instead. 

Once settled on Callisto our Traveler finds they are something of a celebrity, having been all over the solar system with every new colony. 

So we are brought in to discuss the future of Jovian civilization. 

For the outer moons, and indeed even those inner 4, things are simple enough: they will follow the colonial model of asteroids by boring a hole inside for a rotating habitat and mine and expand as the situation demands. 

For Ganymede the situation is somewhat the same as Callisto, but you almost have to live underground because of the radiation. 

It is also likely to have an oceanic layer between the surface rock and ice and the center. 

Io is another story. 

It tends to get written off as non-viable for colonization but that might be a little too pessimistic, and as we noted in our discussion last time about Titan, colonization doesn’t necessarily mean terraforming. 

It would not be hard to put an orbital ring around Io with connected habitats folks lived in and a tether reaching down to the surface to conduct mining operations. 

In this regard Io could serve as an industrial hub, supplying huge amounts of raw materials and manufactured goods to the rest of the Jovian mini-system. 

Again, with the low gravity and close distances it is actually viable even with 21st century rocket technology to ship around goods and people between all these moons. 

But let’s consider Europa next. 

Europa is often considered the best candidate for any other life in our solar system, especially anything more complex than some lichen on Mars or floating microbes on Venus. 

Data from NASA's Galileo mission strongly indicated that Europa has a liquid ocean under its ice-shell that has more water than in all of Earth’s oceans combined and is more than 100km deep. 

Water was one of the main reasons that life evolved on Earth and many scientists believe it might be a necessary element for the creation of life. 

There are some issues when it comes to life evolving on Europa, though. 

One is that the most recent research suggests that an action of having alternating periods in, as Charles Darwin put it, “warm little ponds” of wet and dry were likely required to create the conditions for unicellular life to evolve on Earth. 

For that there needs to be land where a nutrient-rich soup of chemicals can pool that is alternately covered by ocean water and then dried out. 

There is no such land on Europa. 

Another problem is that Jupiter's radiation belts regularly sweep across the surface of Europa, which would sterilize any life on its surface, including any in those warm little ponds. 

That is, if it is life as we know it from Earth. 

Finally, the temperature of those ponds is unlikely to be warm, meaning that biochemical reactions slow down and decrease the chances of life evolving from the soup. 

Now as mentioned, both Callisto and Ganymede probably have those underground oceans just like Europa, so if you find life on one you might find it on the others. 

Indeed as close as they are and as low as their gravity is I wouldn’t rule out that if one had it the others might too, even with those frozen surfaces and radiation belts as a likely barrier to cross-pollination. 

This means in all three cases we want to be careful to keep our eyes open for signs of life; it’s not very likely, but if we find life under the ice on any of these moons it will shakeup our view of the cosmos a lot. 

If that life exists, though, it’s likely to be very different from the life that evolved on Earth. 

But even if it was a simple bacterial life form, that would provide a treasure-trove of genetic information that we could possibly incorporate into our own genetics or make use of industrially and that could be an economic driver for the Jovian colonies too. 

If it is life as we know it, then that will also have repercussions as it then means that Panspermia is probably real. 

Panspermia is the hypothesis that life exists throughout the Universe, distributed by meteoroids, asteroids, comets, and planetoids. 

As I mentioned earlier, Callisto is possibly a better bet for finding life on it than Europa is because Callisto is located largely outside of Jupiter’s radiation belts, has solid rocky surfaces, and therefore may be able to provide us with those alternating wet and dry primordial ponds. 

The only real issue is that it does not have the tidal stresses that Europa does so any heating of the oceans will have to be driven by radioactive decay in Callisto’s core and by sunlight, not through gravitational tectonics. 

In the absence of life though, Europa represents an unusual colonization approach. 

Under the ice is ocean, and in a fusion economy it would be possible to float large fusion reactors that gave off photosynthetic light to warm the seas and let us transplant photosynthetic organisms and our whole marine ecology there. 

You could put the reactors near the surface and hang a chain of lights down, what I referred to as vertical reefs in our discussions of Rogue Planets or enhancements to Earth itself. 

Or you could simply let them float like submarines around the depths with large wire frames around them with lights and nutrients till they became meandering ecosystems fueling an entire marine ecology. 

Submarine archipelagos. 

With Europa’s far weaker gravity diminishing the buildup of pressure with depth, and with light coming from the reactors and not the Sun, such marine life would be far more vertical. 

Human habitats and farms could exist on these submarine archipelagos too, and people might journey around in personal submarines rather than automobiles or small private spaceships. 

It’s hard to overestimate the amount of civilization and colonization that could be done around Jupiter. 

It has immense resources and a good mixture of them so that while it might trade with other planets, it doesn’t really need to. 

Yet what about the planet itself? 

In a fusion economy hydrogen is immensely valuable but also not really in short supply, but the preferred fusion methods, beyond simple vanilla hydrogen which is much harder, would be either deuterium or helium-3, and Jupiter is a great source for both, which are not easy to find in quantity elsewhere. 

Though one doesn’t need a lot for fusion, entire national economies can run their electricity off the energy in one small tank of deuterium for quite a while. 

To harvest that we might scoop it up with ships, giant airships that descended and opened their bays and shot out of the atmosphere before they got too heavy and slowed down. 

This may be the best method early on, and your ship probably needs to be as big as a fusion reactor can be made small, so that it can be powered by what it is collecting. 

We obviously don’t have fusion reactors for spaceships but it’s unlikely you couldn’t make one suitable for that use, and of course if you can’t make one at all, you don’t need to try scooping up gas from Jupiter. 

If you do have a fusion economy then you probably want not just these scoops but big tanker refineries floating around sucking in gas and probably refining out the deuterium or helium-3 from it for pick up. 

However at the bigger scale, when you need billions of tons, scooping with ships is maybe not ideal. 

Folks often want to hang tethers down and just suck material up, either straight from the atmosphere or from our huge flying refineries, but space elevators are a dubious proposition even on Earth, and tethers on Jupiter require far more length and are under 253% of Earth gravity. 

We have an option for this though. 

The orbital rings we’ve discussed before, the ultimate in cheap mass movement of material off a planet. 

You build an orbital ring just above the atmosphere, or even down in it just a little to gain protection against meteors but still be above wind. 

From here you can safely lower down far shorter tether to scoop up gas and retract them up to the ring. 

Above that you can have yet another ring, either several layers or two more, one more circular ring out where gravity has dropped to Earth Normal, and another elliptical one connecting the two. 

Jupiter has a radius of just under 70,000 kilometers, more than ten times Earth’s. 

To get to a place where gravity is the same as Earth, you would need to be 1.59 times further away, 41,000 kilometers above the planet. 

That is probably much too long to stretch any single space elevator tether, so you need either multiple rings each connected to the one above and below, or you need an elliptical one to stretch the distance. 

However up at that top one you could walk around – under a dome – and feel just like you were back on Earth. 

Indeed, as we discussed last week, one option for colonizing Jupiter is simply to build many orbital rings at this distance, each turned at an angle, to create a shell around the planet, then add dirt and water and air and have a planet with 318 times the living area of Earth. 

It would be cold, but you can provide artificial lighting either by many orbital mirrors or an artificial fusion-powered sun orbiting the planet once a day, geocentrically. 

Jupiter is known as the solar system’s vacuum cleaner. 

It is the most massive object in our solar system with the sole exception of the Sun and it deflects or captures a lot of the comets and asteroids that would otherwise head for the inner solar system. 

Without Jupiter, considerably more comets and asteroids would bombard the inner planets, including Earth. 

We can be extremely grateful that we have a big brother keeping watch over us and dealing with those icy and rocky playground bullies that would otherwise pound us. 

There will come a time, though, when humans will have colonized the entire solar system, including the Oort Cloud. 

The Oort cloud is currently where most of our comets are found. 

We will discuss how that can happen in our next episode in the series. 

When we have tamed it all, rogue bodies will be all but eliminated and we will outgrow the need for our planetary big brother to protect us here in the solar system. 

One possible future for Jupiter is to remove all of the gas from Jupiter. 

Down under it all we believe is an immense core of heavier elements several times more massive than Earth. 

If we stripped that all away we might have a rather nice planet below, especially if we moved it closer to the sun and took its moons with it. 

For this purpose we have a device known as a fusion candle. 

There’s a few ways to do this but I’ll describe the one’s Jeremy rendered for the episode since they are the only such animations in existence. 

You build yourself a giant fusion reactor, with an intake nozzle to suck in gas and two propellant nozzles, one pointed down and one pointed up. 

When you turn it on the upward nozzle hurls huge amounts of high velocity gas out of a rocket engine, shooting it fast enough to escape the planet’s gravity. 

That would make the fusion candle drop down into the planet very fast, so the second down-pointing nozzle thrusts the whole candle up to compensate. 

This is one time when you definitely want to burn the candle at both ends! 

You build a ton of these, when they are on the right side of the planet they are on full power, otherwise they hover, so that all your push is in the right direction, and it shoves the planet like a giant spaceship, using its massive atmosphere for power and propellant. 

By this means you can strip off a gas giant’s atmosphere and relocate the smaller remnant to the inner solar system. 

That would be a rather pitiful ending for our big brother planet and I prefer a more exciting option of making the Jovian system into an interstellar spacecraft, taking that whole planet and its moons on an interstellar journey to another solar system. 

It has the fuel and resources to travel at solid speeds across the interstellar void for millions of years if it needs to, and it is one example of how you might send an intergalactic colonization effort, a notion we will examine more at the end of the year. 

That interstellar spacecraft Jovian system could even undergo a further evolution. 

Jupiter is too small to become a star, but that doesn’t need to stop us. 

We can pick up other exo-Jupiters - Jupiter sized planets that have been expelled from other star systems or ones that we have flown out of other systems using fusion candles. 

We gather several of these Jupiters together in interstellar space and fuse them into a super-Jupiter. 

This super-planet, once it reaches a critical mass, will itself become a star about which we can build a custom-made solar system with our super-Jupiter as its star. 

Speaking of getting out into deep space though, our next episode in the series will focus on colonizing not planets but the endless swarms of small icy bodies out beyond the main solar system, in our next episode in the Outward Bound series, Colonizing the Oort Cloud. 

After that we will turn inward, and talk about Colonizing the Sun. 

Not Mercury or making a Dyson Swarm, but the actual Sun itself. 

Next week though we will head back to our discussion of artificial intelligence and look at the well known science fiction concept of a Machine Rebellion, and the week after that we will examine the notion of networked intelligence and Hive Minds.

Mega Earths

I’m occasionally asked if you can make a planet like Earth, only larger, bigger, and if so how much bigger? 

As we’ll see today, the answer is very big indeed. 

We often discuss building artificial habitats in space for humans to live on, today we will discuss building artificial planets. 

Not cylinders or rings for providing apparent gravity by rotation and centrifugal force, but rather the traditional sphere providing gravity by the traditional means of mass and genuine gravity. 

As we have begun finding exoplanets around distant stars, we developed the term Super-Earth, planets larger than our own, but not so big as a gas giant like Jupiter. 

You often hear these compared to Earth but realistically this is not the case. 

Even those not too close nor too far from their sun to have liquid water on their surface are not going to be much like Earth. 

The force of gravity strongly controls the makeup of the surface of a planet, its land, seas, and atmosphere. 

Most planets begin with a large amount of hydrogen on them, as well as helium, the two most common elements in nature but also the lightest. 

The colder a planet is and the stronger its surface gravity and magnetosphere, the easier it is for those elements to remain. 

Left to its own devices, a planet like Earth will leak away all its helium and most of its hydrogen, some hydrogen will remain bonded to oxygen to form water, but not much. 

When you consider that our planet is almost entirely covered in water kilometers deep, it’s worth remembering that is but a tiny remnant of the hydrogen we used to have. 

A planet would not need to be much more massive to potentially have a gravity well and magnetosphere strong enough to seriously diminish losses in hydrogen, so that a planet might be covered in water and a much thicker atmosphere. 

If it is much higher, it may have retained all its hydrogen and helium and be a gas giant instead. 

You spot a planet that is twice as wide as Earth and appears to be about the same density, and composition, and even has a 24 hour day, too. 

What’s different? 

First off, being twice as wide but having the same density, it has 8 times the mass and four times the surface area. 

That last sounds great, 4 times the living room, except if you landed on it you’d find the gravity was twice as strong as Earth. 

Mass rises with the cube of distance, if the object has no change in density, whereas gravity falls off as the square of distance. 

For such an object, the strength of gravity at the surface rises linearly with the distance of that surface to the center, the radius. 

Double the radius, double the gravity. 

I wouldn’t want to live in a place where I weighed twice as much and even a slip down the stairs could shatter bones, but there’s unlikely to be any land to live on anyway. 

Being bigger it also started with more hydrogen, and will have lost a smaller portion of it due to its increased magnetosphere and increased gravity, so odds are any land it has is buried under kilometers of ocean under even more kilometers of atmosphere. 

Needless to say we don’t want that, and of course this is a Megastructures episode so we are not interested in naturally occurring planets. 

We are interested in building our own. 

If you can build artificial planets and your goal is to make them as Earth-like as possible, just bigger or smaller, there’s a lot more to it than just dumping excess matter into some big heap. 

Since they are artificial, we can construct planets of different sizes that have the same surface gravity as Earth. 

The surface gravity increases linearly to radius, but that’s only true if the density remains the same. 

If we constructed a planet the same size as Earth but twice as dense, if it were made mostly of lead, it would have twice the mass, and so would generate twice the gravitational force, undiminished by a larger radius. 

So its surface gravity is the same as our example Super Earth a moment ago of 8 times Earth’s mass. 

Its escape velocity though is not double, but just the square root of 2 or 41% higher than Earth’s. 

If we went the other direction and lowered the density, to half, gravity at the surface would drop to half and escape velocity would drop to 71% of Earth’s. 

It might be too low to hold a thick atmosphere. 

But we can always find a specific density for a given planetary volume or radius that will give the exact same gravity as Earth on the Surface. 

And it’s easy to remember, as it is inverse to radius or diameter. 

If you want a planet that has the same gravity as earth but twice as wide, it simply needs to be half as dense. 

Ten times as wide, one-tenth as dense, one tenth as wide, tens times more dense. 

Earth has an average density of 5.51 grams per cubic centimeter, water is just one gram per cubic centimeter, and we use the term specific gravity to skip the mass per volume. 

Being 5.51 times as dense as water, we know a planet composed entirely of water would be 5.51 times wider to have the same density as Earth, and would have 30.4 times the surface area. 

Which is quite large. 

It would also contain 30.4 times as much mass. 

That’s a handy scaling factor when you are keeping to the same surface gravity, it takes an identical amount of mass to create the same living area at the same gravity. 

If you want a million times the living area, at normal gravity, you need a million times the mass. 

Such a giant sphere would also need to be a thousand times wider than Earth and a thousand times less dense. 

The air we breathe is actually less dense than the sphere itself, and an air-filled balloon or ball is reasonably sturdy. 

Nor does the density have to be constant. 

If you had a big thick shell around a point-like black hole, it wouldn’t matter that the intervening space was empty vacuum. 

Now there are some obvious downsides to building planets this way. 

Firstly, regardless of size you have to spend the same amount of mass for each amount of living area, which for earth gravity is 12 billion kilograms or 12 megatons per square meter of living space. 

You could build a very sturdy chunk of rotating habitat exterior shell for only a ton per square meter, and give yourself a nice thick layer of dirt and water for, say, 120 tons per square meter, maybe 50 meters deep, far deeper than we tend to dig, and use 1/100,000th the mass you would need to make the same living area with a classic spherical planet. 

The supermajority of the universe is hydrogen and helium, which aren’t too useful by themselves, but could be used to generate gravity just fine. 

And when we say supermajority, we are actually excluding dark matter, which - if you could ever collect and confine it - outweighs all the rest of the matter in the universe several times over. 

Just because your artificial planet needs a lot of mass, does not mean you need the rock and soil to go any deeper than our classic rotating habitat does. 

Our second issue is how you could possibly build something strong enough to act as a shell? 

You do not necessarily need one though. 

Saturn for instance, has almost the same surface gravity as Earth, and a shell built around it, like a balloon, could be kept up simply by balancing the internal pressure of the gas against the external pressure of the rocks and water sitting on the balloon shell. 

We have no material strong enough to act as a rigid shell. 

We have discussed doing that with active support in the past. 

I’ve talked about that enough this year, and indeed all the way back to the original Shellworld’s episode, that I won’t repeat that explanation again. 

See the Orbital Rings episode for a discussion of the mechanics involved. 

Such planets resemble a soccer ball. 

Underneath the exterior of rock and dirt is an immense series of windings around a bladder of gas, or even vacuum, and those windings are endless magnetic accelerators pushing materials around at orbital velocities inside themselves. 

Sounds fragile, but it is in fact is a lot sturdier than what we stand on already on Earth, floating atop a sea of hot magma. 

Artificial things make folks worry about failure, compared to the natural systems, but carefully designed, sturdy and well-maintained machines can easily survive a long time and, unlike natural systems, because you created them you know what to expect and how to fix them when tell-tale signs of things going wrong happen. 

Now there are limitations as to how big, or small, you can build these things, but it depends on type and some other factors. 

For type, you can define three: a rigid one held up by a network of orbital rings, the balloon kind held up by an equilibrium of internal and external pressure, and a raw dumping of matter, like is the case with Earth. 

Rocks, soil, and water are a good deal less dense than Earth’s average is, so you could build a bigger planet just by skipping on dense elements like iron and uranium in the planet’s core. 

This version is the one with the least variation, you can’t build much bigger than our Ocean planet, 5.5 times wider with 30 times the surface area, and presumably with floating islands for land. 

You can’t go much smaller either, your densest materials are stuff like Osmium, Tungsten, Gold, Platinum, Uranium, and Plutonium, none of which are particularly abundant and are only 3-4 times denser than Earth, thus allowing you to miniaturize only to about 3-4 times skinnier and about a tenth less land. 

The balloon type has size limitations too, you can’t really go smaller than Earth with one, but you can certainly go larger. 

Again, Saturn is practically ideal to be made one, however, you can’t go much larger, because these things begin to contract under their own mass, so that you’d have no pressure pushing back against the balloon at the Earth-gravity radius, and eventually they get massive enough to form their own sun, which you don’t want underneath you… usually. 

We’ll get to using exotic stars inside shell worlds like white dwarfs, or neutron stars another time. 

Now the episode is titled Mega-Earths, which by common prefix means millions, and if you want a planet a million times bigger than Earth you need to use the orbital ring shell approach. 

This is the type I usually mean when I say Shellworld, though you will also hear them referred to as Supramundane planets, but this indicates size, not what is keeping the thing from falling in on itself. 

Shellworlds have the greatest size range. 

They can be made either much smaller or larger than Earth, and the smallest you can make one is essentially the point at which its escape velocity is so low even room temperature gas will fly away into the void, for all that gravity feels the same. 

The largest size we will save for last, but happens to be when the escape velocity is the same as the speed of light. 

A shellworld does not rely on mass providing the gravity to keep it as a sphere rather than collapsing, so we can circumvent the maximum size issue at which something will ignite and turn into a star by using a black hole instead. 

In theory, those can be made of any size or mass. 

Our sun is not quite a million times more massive than Earth though, so if you want an actual MegaEarth, you either need to use a black hole or use a material that won’t undergo fusion at that mass. 

Helium might do the trick, dark matter should, and any element above helium will. 

Each will have a maximum total mass though, and if you build any bigger you will get a star, and probably a very short lived and explosive one at that. 

All this gravity and stuff though isn’t the only issue. 

Once you start building planets bigger than Saturn for instance, the rotation rate at the equator to produce normal 24-hour days starts exerting a rather noticeable centrifugal force acting in the opposite direction of gravity. 

You might not mind a little lower gravity at the equator, but it will get worse the bigger the planet gets. 

We can curb this by abandoning it being a pure sphere, indeed planets generally are not, being wider at the equator than the poles exactly because they spin, but in our case we do this backwards. 

We make equator more narrow, so when you are on it you are closer to the center of the planet’s stronger gravity, and moving slower, therefore having less centrifugal force. 

At some point, even this stops being viable though, even by the time you are getting to Jupiter size your planet is looking decidedly egg-shaped. 

Fortunately, at this size you are also getting near the maximum before something turns into a star anyway. 

Now, we say a day is 24 hours and how long the planet takes to spin around once, actually that only take 23 hours and 56 minutes, the sidereal day, 360 degrees of spin, but it needs to spin for another 4 minutes to get facing back toward the Sun since the planet moved. 

A day is not how long the Earth takes to spin once, but how long a day-night cycle takes to repeat. 

Now before you jump ahead and say “ah-ha, we’ll go geocentric and have a planet so big the Sun orbits it!”, let me head you off. 

To orbit something as massive as the Sun once a day means only being 3 million kilometers from it, Earth is 50 times further away, and an object at that distance would get 50-squared or 2500 times the sunlight per area, it would flash-fry you! 

That distance increases if the orbiting object is more massive, a pair of binary solar mass stars would orbit daily at 4 million kilometers. 

It also goes up if the central mass is much heavier, but a mass would need to be 100,000 times as massive as our sun to produce a daily orbital period 1 AU out, the distance Earth is, and if we want the same gravity on the surface, a Mega-Earth 100,000 times as massive as our Sun, or 30 billion times more massive than Earth. 

Meaning 30 billion times the surface area and 180,000 times the diameter of Earth, and would thus be over a billion kilometers wide, so you wouldn’t be scorched by the Sun if you were standing on the surface, but only because it would be deep inside the planet. 

If we took the very weakest of stars, those with a luminosity only one ten thousandth of our sun, we could be a 100 times closer to it and not get scorched, just 1.5 million kilometers away, and such a star could orbit once every 24 hours around a Mega-Earth just 20,000 times the mass of Earth. 

But that would be about a million kilometers wide itself. 

So even here you are getting pretty scorched, and the light coming in is almost entirely infrared and more like what an old incandescent bulb gives off. 

Now, we could spin such a planet backwards, letting us place the Sun a bit further out, giving it a longer sidereal day than sunset length, and contracting around the equator to deal with that fast spin issue, egg-shaping the planet. 

You also have a lot more distance to the poles so they are more habitable than on Earth. 

And you could get away with making the day a bit longer too, say 25 hours, so you could sleep in. 

Also, you can play with the albedo of the planet or even set up shades and mirrors around the Sun to block some of the light and redistribute some of that light to those poles. 

This lets you get your sun a bit bigger and whiter, but it’s hard to get above 100,000 times the size of Earth and that’s about it. 

Technically not a mega-Earth, as again that would be a million. 

This is pretty much our boundary even with an artificial sun, one that’s just a big light bulb of a brightness of our choosing, because once you get over a hundred thousand Earth’s worth of planetary mass, you can’t have an object spread out wide enough to only have normal Earth gravity on the surface that also have any orbits of 24 hours around it, rather than inside it. 

It does let you get just a little bigger than a dim red dwarf of a sun permits, and also lets you spread your light out better to not have a far wider spectrum of temperatures between equator and pole than Earth has, so it is better, but doesn’t let you get much bigger for size. 

This does not mean you have to stop. 

You just have to abandon lighting by a normal object you are orbiting or the reverse. 

For instance I could stick a huge mega-Earth around an actual sun and use all that power to light its surface by giant towers over it, streetlamps on an epic scale. 

Or I could build an orbital ring around the planet and have a fake sun race around that, rather than orbit, or forego that to just have light all over that ring that turned on and off, in each its own turn, so it looked like a sun was moving through the sky below even though it was series of massive light bulbs just turning on and off. 

There’s no size limit on this, but once you switch to an artificial source of lighting, you might want to start asking why you don’t just build more layers? 

After all a second thin shell a few hundred kilometers above the first is a whole new free planet, costing you very little extra mass. 

There’s not even much drop in gravity since you aren’t much further away, and indeed you can tweak the distance and mass of the next shell to add to the gravity at its own surface to keep it the same as the lower one. 

Successive concentric shellworld’s, what I usually label a Matrioshka Earth or Matrioshka Shellworld -- not to be confused with a Matrioshka Brain -- let you add each new layer for a mass cost parallel to rotating habitats, and indeed, I see this as one likely future scenario for Earth, as you could mine out lower layers of Earth to add new layers above and just add extra mass stolen from places like Jupiter. 

Your top layer is still entirely natural but your lower layers are artificially lit. 

Since you want your spacing between layers ideally bigger than the atmosphere is high, so you aren’t getting stupidly high air pressures on the lower levels, you could just slather the bottom of the next higher layer in black paint and some fake stars and an artificial sun ring and it will feel decently Earth-like. 

So in order to build a Mega-Earth, you have to be willing to go for artificial lighting, but once you accept that option you can jump even bigger by just adding more layers, though trying to do more than maybe ten is going to give you big issues getting rid of all the waste heat your artificial sunlight produces even if you are tweaking the spectrum to optimize for photosynthesis and human comfort. 

You could have almost countless dim twilight cavern layers full of mushroom forests or storage facilities though. 

Before we get to the biggest example, though, let’s go the other way and consider how small you can make them. 

There’s no limit as to how small a shell world could be made if you can use a black hole as the gravity source, but it eventually becomes more logical to use a traditional rotating habitat, because you need to start doming things under to keep your air in. 

Though you can build one just 100 meters in diameter whose Hawking Black Hole radiation would be enough to power a comfortable homestead on what would be about 7 acres, a bit over 3 hectares, of land. 

You’d need domes or force fields to keep the air in, but it lets you own your own planet. 

If you go much smaller, you have issues with gravity being noticeably different from head to toe and that black hole in the basement giving off too much energy for the planet to dissipate. 

Way back in the original episode on the channel at the end I mentioned that the largest megastructure I’d ever heard of was one of these artificial planets built around a galactic mass black hole, with multiple concentric layers. 

The notion was given to us by Paul Birch, who unsurprisingly also designed the original Orbital Ring concept, as well as the trick for cooling down Venus we discussed a couple months back in Colonizing Venus. 

An interesting feature of the original one is that being that close to that much mass seriously slows down time, so that the folks living on the lower levels have time pass much more slowly than on the higher levels. 

And you might be able to have a lot of levels since beyond being massive power sources, it is sometimes thought you can use black holes, especially bigger ones, as a place to dump waste heat. 

So you could potentially have folks from the top layer, level 1000, go visit levels 1 or 2 for an afternoon and come back to find out that your watch is quite off. 

Our own galaxy’s central black hole is 4.5 million times more massive than the Sun or 1.5 trillion times Earth’s Mass, which means that each layer has 1.5 trillion times the living room Earth has, and a thousand times what even a Full Kardashev 2 Dyson Sphere has. 

Even if you only had a dozen layers it would have about 20 trillion times the living room and you might be able to have hundreds or thousands of layers. 

Like I said though, we can go a bit bigger. 

That structure we just mentioned is so big it would occupy the entire volume out to Saturn, but the black hole itself would be much smaller, not even a hundredth as wide. 

The bigger a black hole gets, the weaker the gravity near its surface gets, which is why you get torn to ribbons approaching a normal one but can get a lot closer to the bigger ones before tidal forces rip you apart. 

Is there a black hole size so large that the gravity at its surface is the same as Earth’s Surface? 

Yes, a black hole with 1.5 trillion times the mass of our sun, or 500 quadrillion times the mass of Earth, has a diameter of nearly one-light year and a gravity at its event horizon equal to Earth’s own. 

This is the absolute largest any structure of this type can be built since any bigger and you would be inside the black hole. 

A single layer of such a shellworld would be almost a billion times the living area of a dyson sphere, and given a modest number of layers it would match in living area an entire Kardashev 3, galaxy spanning empire. 

Not one where every system has an inhabited planet, but where each one was its own Dyson Sphere. 

You can also build one with approximately the mass of a galaxy too. 

Needless to say, time runs very slowly on the lowest layers and even the higher ones, but that makes it a nice place to hide to pass the time and since you would harvested your entire galaxy and maybe a bit more to build it, you don’t have any reason to care what is going on elsewhere. 

It’s basically the most massive structure you can build since firstly, anything bigger will be inside the black hole and secondly, anything bigger requires harvesting material from outside the area of the Universe gravitationally bound to you, rather than destined to fly off over the cosmological event horizon one day. 

Since Paul Birch is far less well-known than he deserves, and since this channel is big enough I can coin names and expect them to stick, I am going to name this a Birch Planet. 

The largest possible Earth-like megastructure you can build under known physics. 

I will go ahead and include the smaller original version around a galactic center black hole as a Birch Planet too, TeraEarth not sounding right compared to a mega-Earth or Giga-Earth. 

Okay, why would you build these? 

Any of these? 

They use a ton of matter, and too much to really justify that they are more Earth-like than a rotating habitat. 

However, as I’ve mentioned before any galactic scale civilization, or even just a decently long-lived interstellar one, needs to think on timelines of more than one classic human lifespan to continue to exist or even come to be in the first place. 

So the amount of mass one person needs for one lifetime stops being a good path for determining the stockpiles of resources you need to keep around. 

When you engage in starlifting and other stellar engine creation, you often will have a ton of useless mass leftover, hydrogen and helium for instance, which has little value except for its mass or mass-energy for fusion or matter to energy conversion. 

You still want to store that stuff so you can use it later, and you might want to take advantage of the gravity it produces. 

If you’ve got some big fuel bunker in space shaped like a sphere, as it presumably would be, you might want to just dump some dirt, water, and air on it and build some houses too. 

In the long term you want to harvest the entire galaxy, and even further if you can, because the raw materials of the Universe are not stored well. 

A solar system you leave sitting around untouched for a million years instead of harvesting is losing value that whole time, burning hydrogen, having solar wind escape, having valuable rocky asteroids and comets crash into their sun, and so on. 

If you are harvesting and storing all that for eventual use, you might as well make use of its gravity now. 

And if you are thinking on those timelines, you aren’t interested in how many centuries or even millions of years some rotating habitat could run its fusion reactors off its tanks of hydrogen fusion fuel, but how many trillions or quadrillions of years a hollow planet stuffed full of hydrogen can run its lighting off that hydrogen, slowly lowering gravity or even contracting the planet as the fuel gets used. 

We will talk about some of those scenarios more when we do our next installment in the Civilizations at the End of Time series. 

Another big advantage of a Birch Planet relates to the scale of Kardashev 3 or K3 civilization. 

A K3 civilization makes use of all of the energy put out by its galaxy. 

I’ve mentioned in other episodes that divergence will inevitably occur due to the timelines involved in setting up and communicating in a K3 civilization that has no faster than light travel or communications. 

It takes potentially a million years to travel across the galaxy even when approaching relativistic speeds. 

Colonizing a galaxy takes millions of years and, even without technological tinkering, folks on the other side of the galaxy might be as genetically different as we are to the dinosaurs. 

The consequence is that members of the K3 civilization across the galaxy are going to be very alien to one another, even if they originally came from the same species. 

If a K3 civilization wanted to make itself cohesive, then the Birch Planet is a solution to the divergence problem. 

A K3 civilization can install itself into a Birch Planet and will be able to communicate to its entire population, a billion, billion times as many individuals as Earth holds, in timelines of about a year. 

Many an old empire from our own history existed within similar constraints and still remained relatively cohesive. 

You can also start building one and just keep making it bigger as more mass becomes available, you don’t have to build a Birch Planet all at once. 

This also leads onto a possible solution to the Fermi Paradox I speak so much about on this channel, which at its simplest is an apparent contradiction that despite a seemingly high probability for the existence of space-faring aliens that there is no evidence that such aliens actually exist. 

Now, we’ve been actively looking for sentient alien life in our galaxy for decades, but we’ve also been looking for signs of it in other galaxies. 

If there were a K3 civilization, we would usually expect to be able to see it from the tell-tale waste infrared heat that it would output, but possibly not if that K3 civilization was on a Birch Planet. 

Even if a Birch Planet put out the ferocious amount of heat that such a vast civilization would produce, we wouldn’t necessarily notice it since it would be concentrated. 

The construction of one uses up an entire galaxy, and while it should be very visible if you are looking at that spot, the odds of looking at that spot aren’t very high. 

What’s more, a maximum sized one is hanging out just over the event horizon of a black hole, so the light leaving it is going to be massively red-shifted, you won’t spot one of these, even the smaller ones, if you are just looking for the infrared signature of an Earth temperature Dyson Sphere. 

But moreover, as mentioned earlier, it is thought that you might be able to dump waste heat into black holes, which you would want to do if that trick works, so a Birch Planet might be incredibly hard to see since it is very far away from any other civilization, very tiny compared to a galaxy, has all it’s light red-shifted, and might be able to use that black hole as a heat sink. 

Now, construction of such a thing is not even vaguely covert, so the civilization that made it isn’t going be hiding, but they’d be hard to see and a Birch Planet, once constructed, would be the perfect place for a K3 civilization to hide from us. 

Perhaps this is the reason we have not seen a K3 Civilization, they build inwards, not expand outwards, just dragging in matter to add to their single immense planet. 

We had to do a lot of math today to discuss our topic, as usual, I did try to keep it to the minimum and supplementary, so that folks who wanted to design artificial planets of their own had the available tools. 

I left out a lot of the math in this video… but to start doing your own research into distant worlds you’re going to need a toolbox… a perfect place for that is Brilliant. 

It's a great place to improve your skill and comfort level with math and science so that you can think like a physicist. 

In Brilliant's Astronomy course, starting from simple beginnings, you can also learn how to model the habitable zone around different stars, look for observational signatures of distant worlds and analyze the logistics of sending probes to explore them. 

With these basic skills, you can go on to explore places like we discussed today, or even dream up new ones.

Next week, we return to the Outward Bound series for Colonizing Jupiter, and we will look at the concept of a mini-solar system of gas giant moons along with oceanic colonies on places like Europa, and how to colonize an actual gas giant itself. 

The week after that we’ll continue our look at Artificial Intelligence, and follow that up with a look at the concept of Hive Minds.

Hive Minds

They say two heads are better than one, so what about two billion? 

Today’s topic is Hive Minds and Networked Intelligence, and I should start by saying they’re not entirely the same thing. 

Indeed while Hive Minds is mostly a subcategory of Networked Intelligence, it has a lot of subcategories of its own too. 

Probably the best known example of a Hive Mind from fiction is the Borg from Star Trek, and those fellows are sufficiently horrifying that it gives Hive Minds a pretty bad reputation. 

To be fair though, they are rarely presented in a positive light in fiction. 

We’ll try to look at some positive aspects and examples today, but to be honest I think I’d rather jump off a cliff than be part of most versions of them so I’m probably not a neutral spokesman. 

Networked Intelligence is another story, as a broad category, and Networked Intelligence itself is one of the three types of Intelligence and possible paths to Super-Intelligence we’ve discussed. 

One of the others is Speed Intelligence, when the mind is the same except sped up. 

That is simple enough conceptually and we’ve talked about it extensively in other episodes. 

Networked Intelligence and Quality Intelligence, which is hard to define beyond the difference between a lone genius who solves a problem a room full of other experts could not, are both types we’ve spent less time on and today we’ll fix that for the former. 

The first key to thing though about networked intelligence is that it’s already something we have. 

And I don’t mean in the way humans themselves are arguably a colony organism composed of many different types of cells and organs. 

Unlike the most integrated forms of Hive Mind, you’re not a bigger intelligence composed of smaller intelligences so I think we have to exclude individual humans as an example of a Hive Mind. 

Defining a networked intelligence is a bit tricky, in order to avoid trivial examples like a herd of animals with limited communication. 

Normally with futuristic concepts I always encourage folks to avoid definitions that would include ourselves since that tends to indicate the definition is bad, you and I are not cyborgs, it’s nice to point out how things like our glasses or tooth fillings or similar can be argued to be mechanical augmentation of a human, but it’s clearly not what we mean by cyborg so you probably have a bad definition if it includes modern humans. 

Similarly, humans are not what we mean when we say Networked Intelligence or Hive Mind, but human civilization was built by us becoming a simple networked intelligence. 

Moreover we recognize such things exist and it’s implicit whenever we refer to group or organization that are beyond classic family and genetic groupings. 

This company, that sports team, that church or village or city or country, we do regard as an entity in its own right. 

A network being a bunch of ropes tied together to create a net, usually with nodes, or knots, it’s probably not too surprising the definition of network is pretty hazy too, but for today’s context we’ll say the simplest thinking network would be several individual nodes, human minds in this case, connected together exchanging information. 

Clearly we’ve been doing this since before there were humans, since even the most basic of body language and noises inside some pack of animals is an intentional exchange of information. 

If you want to stretch the point, you can argue that even two simple organisms exchanging DNA to make a new one is pretty sophisticated communication and you can really stretch the point and include even a simple unicellular organism that reproduces by mitosis, by dividing itself, arguing it is a giant factory or many interdependent machines. 

It’s easy to forget just how complex such bacteria are but it is better to think of them as a giant metropolis full of molecules as people and buildings than some tiny simple organism barely bigger than an atom, after all, each cell usually contains trillions of atoms. 

Like I said though, we have to beware definitions of new concepts so broad as to be meaningless not because it is inaccurate just inconvenient and not helpful. 

I will just place the simplest of networked intelligences at the invention of language, as that seriously jumped up both the bandwidth and integrity of those signals, and as a byproduct allowed far more short term and focused specialization. 

We see limited specialization in almost any group of cooperating animals, and we see intense specialization in things like insect hives, but the sheer amount of fast and accurate data that can be exchanged through human language allows us to train people with identical DNA to perform very specific tasks not strongly shaped by their biology. 

And we see that strongly with the emergence of cities, from which we get the word civilization in the first place. 

Very many people each specialized in very different tasks which could not possibly allow their survival in isolation just doing that specialized task, all grouped together for fast exchange of information and supplies. 

Any definition being a bit arbitrary, I will set this as the simplest example of networked intelligence for humans. 

It also represents a huge paradigm shift and increase in resources and abilities. 

Same as basic communication and tool use made humans jump up over other animals, the rise of cities and civilizations gave a huge edge. 

We have tons of technological improvements that make individual people more effective, we’ve had many more that just let us increase how many people we can have alive and healthy, our carrying capacity. 

However, many of inventions were such boons because they improved the network. 

Roads and bridges to connect rural areas to cities and cities to other cities, carrying not just food and supplies but allowing the movement of people, ideas, and information. 

Ships, railroads, highways, postal systems, radios, telephones, and these days the internet. 

All can be viewed as an amplification and augmentation of basic human speech, which allowed two people fairly near each other to exchange complex concepts quickly and accurately. 

Even the invention of writing, which allowed communication not only over distance but over time itself, improved this basic human network so that it could include dead people. 

Long after they were gone, even from the memories of the next generation or two who met them and spoke to them, writing allowed us to incorporate non-living humans into the human network and the modern internet has allowed us to include computers and databases into that network too. 

We don’t really think of ourselves as networked intelligence, some actual entity called humanity, but even just those of us old enough to remember when the internet did not exist, and even being exposed to it gradually so it lacked an explosive moment of transition, can see a clear difference in the civilization we have now as opposed to then. 

Technological changes happen so fast and frequently these days that we are a bit immune to seeing how they’ve changed us, but it has still happened. 

I wanted to note that though because a bit like cybernetics, networked intelligence is one of those things where it happens gradually enough that we might just keep moving the bar, folks a few centuries from now might be shot through with tons of devices, cloud storing memories outside their head, and routinely talk to people by just thinking their direction with the technological equivalent of telepathy, and still be talking about how in the future people might be cyborgs or network their minds together, not like us of course. 

But no matter how integrated human minds might get to be, the human itself is not the networked intelligence, it’s just a node of it, whether it’s an individual or not. 

Bob is not the networked intelligence of New York City, he’s just a component of it. 

On this subject of Networks and Hive Minds, we are obviously very interested in what happens to the individual, if they still continue to exist or not or are free or not or have privacy or not, but the individual is not the network, even if it is a key or irreplaceable component. 

Who is the network? 

The network is the network. 

We have a thought problem that’s fairly interesting for developing this notion. 

We’ve talked a lot about copying a human mind onto a computer substrate where the processors emulate neurons. 

That’s an intuitive enough concept for folks, but you can just as easily – well not easily – sit millions of people down with pencil and paper and have them perform all those same calculations that the computer is doing, storing each result on paper and walking over to hand each new bit to another calculator. 

We can envision your neurons doing this to make you. 

We can envision computer chips doing this to make you. 

But there is something passing strange about the idea of a ton of people cranking all the calculations out manually, including folks looking at a scenery and jotting down data to be sent to giant skyscraper full of cubicles manned by the team that makes up your eyes and optic nerve. 

Yet by the same logic as the neurons or computer emulation, that would be you, and in this case you would be a networked intelligence, all those people are your nodes. 

You don’t, as with the traditional hive mind, have access to their thoughts, you can’t control them, they are not indeed wired into your mind at all. 

We could also replace them with a giant ant colony, a literal hive, that wasn’t calculating but perform those operations far more stupidly and simply, pushing colored or scented grains around to serve as your bits and signals. 

I like this example, where people or ants – our usual example of a hive mind – are cranking out calculations to run your mind because it both shakes ups the notion of thinking of an uploaded mind on a computer as essentially just a substitute brain – a black box doing the work – and highlights that such a thing doesn’t actually have to be composed of the actual minds of its nodes in an intrusive manner. 

I think it also easier to picture some place like New York City or Tokyo as a potential real separate entity with thoughts when you’ve just tried to wrap your head around a million people with pencil and paper running your mind. 

I don’t think I’d ever categorize one of these as a true networked intelligence unless the mind being generated was actually smarter than the individual components each were. 

At least at some tasks, and while some group of people working on a problem together might come up with ideas faster and better than an individual could, and maybe even ones no individual would have thought of, it’s not really exhibiting much intelligence itself. 

Of course in fiction it often is because its individual members have usually become drooling morons. 

At best one can justify this with the assumption that collective mind is using every spare bit of processing power, up to and including the bits that process stuff like optical signals so that people can walk right by drones without even being seen maybe, but this is mostly just bad writing. 

Or very good writing, in the case of Star Trek’s Borg the writers are presumably more focused on making a dreadful inhuman enemy that dehumanizes people, and nothing better shows that than folks stumbling around without apparent self-awareness, like a zombie. 

So I won’t knock the writer’s from a story standpoint, just a logical and science standpoint. 

The Borg are idiots, individually and collectively, and I doubt that demonstrates an actual hive mind properly, even if I love them as villains. 

I think I preferred Unity, a parody of the Borg from the cartoon Rick &amp; Morty, where the titular character Rick gets the hive mind Unity drunk and it comments how it probably shouldn’t be trying to run 200,000 Pediatric hospitals and 12 million deep fryers in that state. 

And it’s a key point about such hive minds, that if you’re composed of lots of individual components designed for doing such things on their own, you probably shouldn’t be running them. 

Humans not only have components of ourselves we control subconsciously, but plenty of bits that operate with no control whatsoever, I don’t need to tell my DNA to unzip and replicate, though it might be handy to be able to tell it when to do that and when not to. 

Indeed we do have some regulation methods inside the body and cancer can result when that breaks down. 

I’d imagine a Hive Mind could develop the equivalent of cancer, and if it layers up a lot minds, sub-minds that supervise this or that, it would have to worry not just about individual members leaving or attacking it if they did, but also sub-minds, smaller hive minds, rebelling or breaking away. 

Obviously the more autonomy you have at the lower levels the more of an issue that would be, my kidneys have never tried to declare independence or stage a revolt. 

Hive minds though could easily end up undergoing such breakaways or mitosis as a form of reproduction. 

In the absence of instantaneous communication it might need to as well. 

I mentioned a few episodes back in Digital Death that a human brain spread out to the size of planet, but with its signals switched over to light speed ones, would process at the same rate as a normal human mind, spread out beyond that and you either need some form of FTL communication or you will start suffering time lag issues. 

So spreading a hive mind over multiple planets, let alone solar systems, would seem a serious limitation. 

I tend to be skeptical about us ever inventing any form of FTL, but even if we grant it for the moment, a lot of fictional and theoretical FTL methods are simply faster than light, not instantaneous, or have serious bandwidth issues. 

You can probably run an interstellar empire on dial-up modem speeds, the old Battletech &amp; Mechwarrior franchise did that, but I can’t see running a hive mind that way. 

This is one possible Fermi Paradox Solution that gets kicked around too, that aliens don’t spread out from their homeworld much because they converge to being hive minds or get replaced by singular entities like a Super-intelligent planet sprawling computer. 

I tend not to bring it up in Fermi Paradox discussions because it’s not a good one, but it is of interest today. 

It’s not a good one because you can’t assume every civilization does this, you can’t assume none would be willing to subdivide to found a small new hive mind in another system, and it still suffers from the Dyson Dilemma, in that you can build Dyson Swarms around your own home star and as we saw in the Mega Earths episode you can just keep building those up with resources brought in from elsewhere until it is galactic mass and hovering just above the critical density to turn into a black hole, either as a Birch Planet or a truly huge Dyson Swarm of Dyson Swarms. 

I think most hive minds would be willing to reproduce by making a new one elsewhere, but they might not like the idea of essentially making a rival, and for that matter they might need a certain minimum number of people just to make existence bearable for those colony splinters. 

In Kevin J. Anderson’s Saga of the Seven Suns you’ve got a limited hive mind, the Ildirians, who tend to need to do everything big, including their defense fleets, just to have enough of them in one place to stay effective and sane. 

The Geth from the Mass Effect franchise had that issue too. 

If that was hard to overcome you’d probably need to bring resources back rather than expand. 

Now there’s the question of who would go out and retrieve those resources from around the galaxy, but any hive mind that can’t design an automated mining vessel obviously came out a loser on the deal when it became one. 

It’s the same issue with folks living in virtual realities, they might not want to abandon their paradise to go harvest resources far away, but they shouldn’t have to. 

If you can make simulated paradises it implies you can make something smart enough to decently mimic people to talk with in that paradise, so programming a ship to gather stuff and bring it back ought to be child’s play, and one would tend to think a hive mind could do it too, especially since they presumably had to be pretty good with intelligence and computers to make their hive mind in the first place. 

That skips those that naturally evolved, who are often shown as being awful with computers because they never developed them. 

We get that with Morning Light Mountain in Peter Hamilton’s Commonwealth Saga and with the Buggers or Formics in Ender’s Game, and lots of other insect hive examples. 

The former, Morning Light Mountain, cannot naturally speak faster than light, as most of the fictional examples can, so it does have a decent head for electronics and cybernetics but still never developed computers much. 

In Ender’s Game the Buggers do have instant communication and telepathy they naturally evolved, indeed humans back-engineered their own interstellar communications off this. 

Sort of, they knew it could be done since they could tell by watching Bugger ships react to things faster than the speed of light should have permitted them to witness it, and knowing it could be done, humanity then figured it out. 

It is implied they need a queen reasonably nearby for this to work though, as a sort of central node. 

Though in later books it is stressed that the Queen’s body is just one more drone to her, albeit a critical one, and that she isn’t really the queen or maybe even the hive but more like our example earlier where your intelligence was run by ants. 

We also get a retcon about the individual buggers actually having intelligence of their own. 

Orson Scott Card is pretty good about consistent canon by and large but some explanations changed over the series, tweaked for consistency I assume. 

I remember when I did the Stupid Aliens episode and mentioned the book I irritated some folks discussing the Buggers, “That’s not what it was in the book!” and kept having to remind folks that it isn’t a book, it’s a series of around 20 novels and short stories written over 30 years, and that they weren’t saying I was wrong, they were saying the author was. 

Always a problem in science fiction when stuff needs retconning, or maybe didn’t but gets it anyway, a lot of folks were irritated when Alice Krige showed up in Star Trek First contact, the film not the episode, as the Borg Queen, but it didn’t bother me too much personally. 

The Borg originally spoke with one voice out of thousand mouths, cold and alien and unified like a sociopathic chorus so have a single queen talking seemed wrong, but to be fair the borg originally were going to be an insectoid hive race but they didn’t have the budget so we get the black leather body horror look that seems like something out of Clive Barker’s Hellraiser franchise, so changes happen, and it gave the audience a central focus for their villain. 

There’s also no reason a Hive can’t have a mouthpiece, it’s actually inefficient to have a thousand people saying the exact same thing, and a hive doesn’t have to be homogenous with every member having the same function and status, insect hives aren’t like that after all, it could be a meat puppet to use as a collective voice or even a semi-independent system. 

Now the Borg are horrifying in their own right but the usual thing that bugs people about them is that membership tends not to be optional. 

Even in Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, the rather benevolent Hive Mind of Gaia, which still has modest individuality for its members, is plotting galactic takeover and by conscription not volunteers. 

It was not a popular move with most fans either, myself included, and is often guessed as the reason why all future books in the series were set before the incident. 

Nonetheless there are tons of examples of good hive minds in science fiction, especially when telepathy seemed to be an omnipresent feature even in hard science fiction novels, a trend I’m glad finally died off in the last couple decades, but common or not, rarely do I hear folks speaking of them with enthusiasm. 

Pretty much the only member of a Hive Mind in fiction I like is Nevil Clavain for the Revelation Space series, it probably helps that he’s a viewpoint character who joined semi-voluntarily, never upgrades his implants from the earlier versions that were less connected, and is often on bad terms with his own faction, the Conjoiners, so he doesn’t exactly cheerlead for them. 

They also don’t indiscriminately spread and assimilate folks involuntarily either. 

Interestingly Clavain’s faction in the books is often in conflict with the other faction of humanity that is closest to being a hive mind too, the Demarchists. 

They are more of a bunch of intelligences who are networked, so to speak, as like most people they have a ton of mental implants but one of theirs, and the key one for their specific civilization, is one that tries to go straight democracy, no representatives, by having everyone vote on almost everything. 

Sort of like if every bill in congress got text messaged to you for a vote, only as best I can tell the implants allow them to do it mostly subconsciously and even asleep. 

I’m assuming the implants in everyone’s head know them individually well enough to guess how they’d respond. 

Forgetting the specific mechanics, that is kind of the ideal of most versions of democracy and its parallels, everyone gets a say in what happens because everyone has an investment in the outcome and a right to self-determination, so networking folks to make news and details easier to get and absorb to make more informed decisions seems ideal. 

Obviously taken too far you get a hive mind where nobody gets any say in anything because there’s no individuality leftover. 

The other big issue is the privacy one, and that’s a serious issue of the future even when you’re not telepathically linked to other people. 

However in the networked intelligence case, short of a hive mind, I do think that’s just an artifact of telepathy in science fiction. 

We associate telepathy as reading people’s minds, not just the equivalent of a phone or internet connection, so a method using that will understandably make you figure all those minds can read each other and freely look around or even merge. 

Again, part of why I don’t like telepathy in fiction, made up non-science makes for bad extrapolations of the future. 

Folks end up picturing some mind eating hive or a bunch of folks joining hands around a drum circle to meditate and combine their souls. 

My computer, and thus me, is connected to the internet and to you, obviously, or you couldn’t hear me now. 

I’ve never noticed my smartphone trying to merge into my brain even when I’m holding it next to my head or my computer trying to eat my neighbors. 

I can read my files from other computers in my house or on a network but only the ones I’ve shared. 

When you doing this stuff with mystical telepathy that presumably can’t be done or it takes special effort and training. 

But when you do it with technology you have to understand how it all works, how brains and memory function, to do it in the first place, so segmenting things off or only sharing specific chosen bits is possible from the outset, and if I want people to know what my schedule is, I can make that open just like my google calendar, or if I want only my doctor to be able to look at my medical status, I can do that too. 

So I think, when we’re talking about a technological route to a more networked intelligence we don’t necessarily have to discard privacy and individuality to gain the many obvious benefits. 

You also probably don’t have to go the all in or out option, one size fits all. 

Living in a city traditionally cuts down privacy a bit, hence many of us prefer the peace and solitude of the country, doesn’t mean we’re divorced from civilization. 

So too, one can presumably set up such a network to allow people variable involvement to fit their tastes, in general and at the moment. 

Also just like civilization, you could enjoy sub-networks, I’m part of humanity and the US and my state of Ohio and my little village and dozens of various related and unrelated social or professional groups, my level of involvement in each varies and I can adjust my commitment. 

You could have a human overmind with, say, the sub-mind of Ohio, which was both a separate entity and part of the Earthmind at the same time, and how much so might fluctuate, as might its membership, with some joining or leaving and involving themselves to varying degrees. 

Vernor Vinge explores this notion with a race called the Tines in his classic novel, “A Fire Upon the Deep”, where we see small groups minds of often just a few critters that often switch members who are not really individuals on their own. 

There’s a lot of options for this in fiction but I would tend to guess people who predict this as an eventuality for humans are semi-correct. 

Just my guess but the error being made is that folks don’t want to give up their privacy and individuality and must eventually mature to be okay with that, and I personally don’t see that as more mature or necessary, that you have to sacrifice privacy or individuality to enjoy the benefits of a greater degree of networking and group cooperation. 

Though I could easily see a lot of folks choosing that route, and so long as admission is voluntary more power to them. 

Obviously if you’re too interdependent it makes it hard to get out there and settle the galaxy, and we’ll be looking at a first step to that next week in Colonizing the Oort Cloud, which contains tons of potential places for us to colonize but usually so far apart even compared to planets that no unified Hive Mind would be viable. 

The week after that we’ll leave the solar system and continue to explore the problems with unification, especially with light speed limitations, in Interstellar Empires, and then we’ll finish out 2017 by heading out of the galaxy and asking if it is even possible to settle other galaxies in a Universe without faster than light travel.

The Cosmic Ocean

2017-11-09

The Universe is a vast cosmic ocean. 

Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. 

Had Carl Sagan not passed away, today, November 9th, would be his 83rd birthday. 

I imagine a large part of the audience for this channel remembers Sagan, and fondly so, and I am no exception. 

He is one of the great inspirations for this channel. 

Sagan was one of the world’s best-known futurists. 

He and I have some things in common in that we are both scientists, futurists, and techno-optimists with a deep belief that our destiny lies up there in the stars. 

I've always tried to emulate what he did so well by making the topics interesting and straight-forward, not to oversimplify them, but to explain what can be explained in a way that doesn’t overcomplicate things. 

Cosmos, Sagan’s famous TV series in the 1980s, came out right after I was born. 

I can't remember when I first saw it, probably when I was quite young as my mother was a fan of his. 

I've probably seen every episode at least a few times. 

I guess what always stuck out to me is that the Cosmos series reveled in the mystery of the universe, but also sought to explain it. 

That always seemed the right way to present material. 

There are many areas where Sagan’s work intersects with my own and I’m going to spend some time in this episode looking at that in more detail. 

While Sagan was and still is a major inspiration to me, we do not agree on everything, but that is not particularly surprising or undesirable. 

There is also a lot more technology and observations that have changed our views of the universe from the time Sagan did his most famous work in the 1980s and 90s. 

It’s hard to overestimate the impact Sagan’s had on this channel and I wanted to point out some of the cases I’ve drawn on his work today. 

We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and while Sagan did as well, he was one of those giants and his work permeates our discussions of these topics and themes. 

Sagan liked to talk about the stars, but he also liked to speculate about alien civilizations that might dwell around them and that is a topic we have covered under a slightly different heading on this channel, so let’s start there. 

Sagan believed that extraterrestrial life is possible and probable. 

I also tend to think that simple alien life is probable. 

Sagan believed that an alien planet with sentient alien species was distinctly possible and asked in the Cosmos Episode titled “One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue” whether we were alone, or as he put it “... is there a cosmic fugue, a billion different voices playing the life music of the galaxy?” To address Sagan’s question of whether we are alone or not, we need to consider the Fermi Paradox, which at its simplest is an apparent contradiction that despite a high probability for the existence of space-faring aliens that there is no evidence that such aliens actually exist. 

Sagan had far fewer tools and much less data to work with back in his day and he admitted this in that Cosmos episode where he said: “For the first time, as we will see, we’ve begun a serious search for the cosmic fugue.” That serious search, from what we have gathered so far in the 30 plus years since, shows that the Fermi Paradox is real and we see no evidence for any alien species that have reached Kardashev 2, also known as K2, status where they are able to make use of all of the energy produced by their local star. 

A K2 civilization would put out very distinct tell-tale signs in the infrared spectrum that we would have picked up by now. 

That is important because, as I have discussed in our earlier episodes, we are already nearing the point where our technology will enable us to become a Kardashev 1 level civilization, where we utilize all of the energy available on our planet, and then quickly transition into a K2 civilization. 

If we put the effort and resources into it, we could probably be a K2 civilization in just a few centuries. 

Given the relatively short period of time that it would take for us to become a K2 civilization, why have we not seen any of the expected tell-tale signs of aliens that have already achieved that level of development? 

Sagan referred a lot to the risks of self-annihilation in his TV series, Cosmos. 

He highlighted these with reference to the use of nuclear weapons and potential ecological disasters. 

What Sagan was in effect warning about is that self-annihilation is one example of a Great Filter, which we discussed in our earlier episodes on “Great Filters”. 

I don’t happen to agree that self-annihilation is a particularly strong Great Filter, but given the lack of any evidence of alien K2 civilizations, it certainly cannot be ruled out as a factor. 

In contrast to Sagan, I happen to believe that the major Great Filters are set in place earlier in the developmental cycle of life in the phases between the creation of the conditions that give rise to life, its development into multi-cellular organisms, and to the development of a sentient brain. 

In the end, though, we arrive at the conclusion that the Fermi Paradox is probably explainable using Great Filters. 

Sagan was very much in favor of space colonization, believing humanity is driven by a guiding force of our genetic heritage that makes us humans unique and that binds us together. 

He believed that that force of exploration and the desire to escape a potentially devastating future on Earth should drive us to colonize the solar system and beyond. 

I too believe that we are destined to colonize space and the stars. 

We recently explored colonization of Mars in an episode of our Outward Bound series. 

Sagan explored this too in his Cosmos episode titled “Blues for a Red Planet” where he set out how such a mission could be accomplished, much of it prophetic. 

He suggested the use of robotic missions, which, of course, we have already done with the Mars rovers Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity. 

He also saw an interplanetary ship constructed in Earth orbit that would carry humans to Mars too. 

I happen to believe that the materials for such a mission would be best sourced from the Moon - meaning that such a mission would be more conveniently assembled in lunar orbit - but Sagan’s vision for the future of Mars exploration is now much closer to becoming a reality by the likes of Space-X. 

While he discussed almost every area of science, his first love was always his own field of astronomy, and while this channel spends a lot of its time in space, we do not spend too much of that on astronomy itself. 

Yet the Universe is an immense place of infinite wonders and I thought for today we’d spend some time on those. 

Voyager 1 is a space probe that is in the process of leaving our solar system. 

In 1990, at the request of Sagan years earlier, a photograph of Earth was taken by Voyager 1 that shows Earth, 3.7 billion miles away, to be nothing more than a pale blue dot, which became the title of one of Sagan’s books in 1994. 

If this channel could be said to have any single main focus, I suppose that it would be ways of venturing out from our Pale Blue Dot of a homeworld and exploring and colonizing that vast Cosmic Ocean all around us. 

One of things we do on this channel is to try to take the science we know and the technologies which we either have now or look like safe bets and try to guess at what the future will actually look like. 

To get out there to the stars we tend to assume we need some way to travel faster than the speed of light, but we have no solutions for that at this time and any prospects look grim. 

Popular science likes to discuss warp drives and wormholes and we’ve explained them here in the FTL series, but the sad reality is that they don’t appear to have very realistic options for ever being developed. 

If they do, that’s great; I won’t hold my breath though. 

However, I’m not willing to give up on space travel just because of that and, as it turns out, we don’t have to. 

Our focus today, and on the channel in general, isn’t to say various fantastic technologies won’t ever be invented, but to challenge the assumptions that we MUST have them to succeed at seemingly overwhelming challenges, such as colonizing space. 

I’ll quell my skepticism on FTL drives as soon as someone hands me a bottle of water containing a negative liter of water, a yardstick that is negative one meter long, or a real number that when multiplied by itself has a negative value. 

Fundamentally every proposed FTL method seems to rely on things like that, mathematically valid concepts that do not appear to have real physical analogs. 

Though truth be told, I’d be very worried about any prototype engine that folks thought was going to pull it off. 

As we’ve discussed before, FTL only exacerbates all the problems we have with the Fermi Paradox, and if it turned out to be possible I would start wondering if we might have some serious flaws in our perception of the Universe and Life. 

Sagan, like most physicists, also took the view that the speed of light could not be exceeded, so I’m in good company here. 

So, we will not break the speed of light in this episode, but we will break our preconceptions of what space is. 

The classic image we are given from scifi, and indeed even science, is that the galaxy is an immense barren void. 

To think of solar systems in this light, one can picture a vast desert thousands of kilometers across in which a handful of oases no bigger than a small pond exist, and these are solar systems. 

Of these, only a tiny percentage would have yellow stars like our own around which a few might have an Earth-like planet or one close enough that we could terraform it. 

And this image is accurate enough, indeed still a bit generous. 

Were we to imagine a light year was a hundred kilometers, these oases, these solar systems, would tend to be many hundreds of kilometers apart and their habitable zones would be just a meter or so across. 

One of those grains of sand would be a planet, and scaled up properly, such a desert would need to be 10 million kilometers across. 

This is the classic view. 

However it ignores that we might cultivate that entire little pool rather than a single grain of sand in it. 

This is what we mean when we speak of Dyson spheres. 

But that’s not the end of it because while the space between these oases star systems is huge, it isn’t entirely empty. 

Most of the material in the galaxy is not inside stars, not even including dark matter which is most of it. 

That regular matter is mostly floating around in the interstellar void and much of it accumulates into small bodies. 

A good deal more of it is simple hydrogen gas, waiting for its chance to end up in a star one day. 

However to cover the vast gulfs between stars we almost have to have fusion - the very process that turns that hydrogen into energy in a sun. 

We’ve discussed some possible workarounds should fusion turn out to be impossible after all, but for my part I think it is something we will crack this century. 

Indeed, we technically cracked it in the middle of the last century but if you want to use fusion bombs as a power source for electricity or spaceship drives you have to build to quite a large scale. 

In the Cosmos episode “Journeys in Space and Time”, Sagan discusses a fusion-powered craft called Project Daedalus that travels at 10% of light speed. 

I always think it is important to remind people of that since many are skeptical of fusion and like to repeat that bit about it being the technology of 20 years from now and always will be. 

We aren’t trying to invent fusion reactors, we’re trying to invent compact ones that can just power a city rather than a planet, or propel a spaceship smaller than New York City. 

We’ve talked about ways to do space travel if we never get compact fusion working. 

Sagan discusses the Project Orion plans in Cosmos that would make use of hydrogen bomb explosions to propel an interstellar craft. 

More modern ideas like the Interstellar Laser Highway offer higher speeds than a fusion or fission drive could obtain, but the key point is that if we assume we do have fusion plants we also have the ability to make interstellar spaceships. 

No other technology is required, even if there are several that would make it much easier. 

However, loosely speaking, it takes something like 10^20 joules of energy to move a person to another neighboring solar system in less than a human lifetime. 

In terms of energy, that’s also enough to support someone for millions of years even if you have to make artificial sunlight to grow their food. 

So the same reactor that makes traveling to other stars with habitable planets possible makes it less necessary to find those rare planets like Earth to call new homes. 

Every icy rock meandering about the outskirts of a solar system suddenly becomes every bit as attractive as a new home as a near-Earth clone. 

Terraforming planets is in many ways just as hard, or harder, than constructing an equal amount of artificial habitats. 

Sagan also explores the possibility of colonizing the Oort cloud in his book, Pale Blue Dot, and we’ll be looking at that concept in December. 

This isn’t going to stop folks from building interstellar ships and heading off to stars, but it means rather than civilizations occupying just a few astronomical units near a star, each separated by hundreds of thousands of AU from their neighbors, you’d likely find habitats spread throughout that whole volume. 

Each a little cactus in the desert. 

At a basic level the cost of interstellar travel isn’t about distance so much as speed, and the energy needed to get there and back. 

That’s another problem with traveling very fast; the closer to light speed you get the more energy it costs you, and it rises very steeply. 

Something most people discussing hypothetical FTL methods tend to gloss over is that not only do those systems all rely on the square root of -1 having a real physical expression, but they are massive energy hogs, even compared to relativistic spaceships. 

As I just mentioned, relativistic ships tend to need energy supplies in the output range we tend to associate with powering national economies. 

So the three basic objections to going to the stars slowly tend to be that you’d die before you got there, that you could never skip off to another solar system to shake hands with aliens, and that you can’t fly around inspecting spatial anomalies. 

The first of these was dealt with by Sagan, who suggested the use of generational ships in the Journeys in Space and Time episode. 

It’s also entirely possible that we will figure out how to extend people’s lifetimes or freeze them and thaw them out, what Sagan calls hibernation. 

People always seem weirdly skeptical of this but not of FTL travel. 

Tell people you are going to build a swarm of star encompassing megastructures or extend the human lifespan and they don’t believe it, even though both are demonstrably inside the laws of known science. 

Tell them we can never build the Millennium Falcon and go zipping around the stars and they think you’re being defeatist and short-sighted. 

I also mentioned two other things, that you can’t go meet aliens and that you can’t go investigate space anomalies. 

Given enough time you will always be able to meet aliens, since even ignoring deliberate technological intervention in terms of genetic engineering you will have a lot of drift. 

Humans colonizing a galaxy and taking a few million years to do it are going to be about as human or like each other as you are to a cat or dog. 

Remember, they’re family too, they’re just like your millionth cousin ten million times removed. 

You don’t even have to be in another solar system, after all your cat and dog aren’t. 

The sheer immensity of things like Dyson Swarms and Kardashev 2 civilizations allows a lot of divergence, and when we throw in accelerated mutation from genetic engineering, options like cybernetics or uplifting, and the large number of pathways Transhumanism or artificial intelligence might take, you could easily have thousands of alien civilizations living inside your home solar system that were ten times as alien as the critters we usually see in scifi. 

They wouldn’t even necessarily share any DNA with you, or even use DNA, and you can go around discovering them all you like. 

You wouldn’t be the first, they’d have whole volumes discussing their culture logged in the Encyclopedia Galactica, but they’re new to you. 

Alternatively if there are alien civilizations out there that’s probably going to be the case for them too. 

I mean we’ve barely been in space, not for long nor traveled far, and we already shipped off naked pictures of ourselves and a roadmap to our house, and odds are good at least one or two other civilizations would be older but equally open to contact. 

Though admittedly if someone moved into my neighborhood and acted that way I’d probably start ducking their phone calls and having my evenings filled with fictitious affairs that made me unable to attend a housewarming party. 

That leaves us our third one, which is exploring space anomalies. 

Unfortunately, while the Universe is a fascinating place full of many things which are beautiful and strange, this isn’t Star Trek where you wander into bizarre new space anomalies every week exhibiting new physics. 

To make matters worse, that’s not how rational civilizations explore weird anomalies either. 

You shoot unmanned probes to look at such things first. 

You do this because science is interested in understanding, not excitement, and we will not launch huge manned expeditions that could imperil lives for no realistic gain simply because people want excitement. 

It’s unethical and irresponsible, even more so than having all your senior officers beam down to investigate the matter. 

Makes for good fiction but not good science or responsible management. 

If we spot an anomaly we’ll eyeball it from afar, launch a probe to do a flyby – ships that don’t have to slow down can always go faster than ones that do – then follow that up with one that does slow down but can still get there faster than a manned ship. 

Then, at last, if it still isn’t solved, a manned ship might go there. 

Likely after hundreds if not thousands of probes have flitted by or parked to monitor it. 

Even that manned ship is really only necessary if you don’t have FTL so that you can get intelligent critters on the scene rather than dealing with all the time lag for communication. 

You can’t send a very smart unmanned probe because that’s essentially an oxymoron; if your probe is smart enough to be doing the sorts of thinking we’d otherwise prefer to send a team of experts out to do, you probably shouldn’t be viewing it as expendable or unmanned. 

So it’s really only in a no-FTL Universe where you’d be likely to ever have direct contact with anomalies or undiscovered civilizations since you can’t remotely control your probes and drones from light years away. 

And while there are anomalies in space, and one should not think of space as almost entirely empty or made of bits that are like all the other bits, ‘space explorer’ is unlikely to ever be a common job title. 

At least in terms of wandering around on a spaceship just visiting systems and looking at them. 

I suppose you could anyway, but I can’t imagine any nation or group authorizing a huge ship to be built to run that way. 

Would you trust a multi-century expedition to be run by someone who thought parking next to an anomaly for a close look by the crew was a good idea? 

Rather than one who tends to launch a lot of probes there as advance scouts? 

Just because exploration wouldn’t be the primary purpose of a given ship, that doesn’t mean it wouldn’t get any done. 

Colony ships will certainly do lots of exploring when they arrive and will have before they got there too. 

You could have an interstellar ship that was quite small, indeed potentially smaller than a person since the crew need not be biological. 

Or it could be quite big, yet still have a small crew, simply from excellent automation. 

Self-repairing systems might be quite elaborate and steering through deep space isn’t too complicated. 

Indeed we’d tend to expect that, after all, whether you are using AIs to run a ship or actually making a living ship whose intelligence regards the ship as its body, a big space whale if you would, we would expect to use a ton of automation on ships. 

Yet I would tend to expect them to be quite large and with large crews, and the reasoning is twofold. 

First, as with colonizing deep space rather than just solar systems, the same technology that lets you automate a ship to need only a small crew also lets you automate the factories that build those ships. 

Any decent-sized asteroid of the kind we have thousands of in our solar system contains quite enough material to fashion thousands of giant fleets, one for each system we’d likely to settle directly. 

If you can build ships that can maintain themselves then you can build factories that can make those ships by themselves too, so fundamentally the same technology that lets you build a self-maintaining vessel lets you crank out giant armadas on the cheap too, and I don’t think finding volunteers for colonization will ever be too hard. 

Either you need that many people to maintain the ships, the ecology to be transplanted, and the civilization to be transplanted, or you don’t but can easily include them. 

The thing is you need all that size and all that crew because you aren’t exploring, nor are you sending off a seed. 

If we want to plant our civilizations in alien soil under an alien sun we have to plant our civilization, not just a few people. 

You took centuries to get there, and the civilization you left is now probably dust, no more the home you knew than a foreign country would be. 

Even messages from home are old. 

Settle twenty light years away and a communication back home would be received by someone who had to go look up the original message written by his predecessor talking about this cool new movie called Star Wars. 

Running a ship or a fleet for centuries of travel might be something that can be done automatically. 

Perhaps even transplanting an entire ecology might be done so, but a whole civilization? 

I don’t know about that. 

Now theoretically an artificial intelligence might fly to some planet in a ship no bigger than a football, unpack and start building the infrastructure to grow and clone a whole ecology from digital DNA records, including people it might raise from birth in the traditions of their civilization. 

Thing is, again, if you’ve got a machine that smart, I’m not sure you’d want to rely on it to do your colonizing for you since it raises a host of not just technical problems, but ethical ones as well. 

You’re sending out splinters of your civilization that will diverge a lot from the original. 

They might begin that way, some specific cultural, ideological, or religious group funding a colony, but even if you send out one that started with a random and fully representative cross-section of our culture it would mutate in time and a very short time as these things go. 

We’ll talk about that more next month when we get to Interstellar Empires and giant colonial fleets shortly after when we close the year out with an episode on Intergalactic Colonization. 

We’ll also discuss some of those problems, ethical and technical, with using AI later this month, but this is not an episode on those topics. 

However they speak to our ability and motives to get out there and explore the cosmic ocean. 

For my part I don’t think we need any other motivation but to explore and to go out there, but it’s nice to have them, and I don’t think we need apparently impossible techs like FTL to do it. 

If we get them, that’s great, but if not, it won’t stop us. 

And it’s a point that I always feel is important to stress these days in this role I’ve stumbled into as a science communicator, especially when folks often feel frustrated by how slow we seem to be at extending our reach, nearly half a century after the first and last manned Moon landings. 

We can do it, and we have plenty of time to turn that dream into a reality - a century is not even an eyeblink in the lifetime of the Universe. 

But it can be a bit depressing to have to wait on that because a century might be an eyeblink to the Universe but it is all the time we tend to be given. 

In that respect I think it’s important to remind ourselves of the challenges we face and how much effort it takes to solve them, and that we continue to make that effort and make progress. 

That’s why I think folks like Carl Sagan did such a service to humanity by outlining these visions. 

I wouldn’t say that Sagan was the first science communicator. 

Even for television, that title probably better belongs to Don Herbert, better known as Mr. 

Wizard, but Sagan had a unique way of speaking about science that could fill audiences with interest in the mysteries of the Universe. 

And while he was hardly blind to the faults of humanity, he always advanced a viewpoint that was fundamentally optimistic and inspirational. 

His impact on many aspiring scientists, myself included, can never be underestimated, and his ability to convey all the wonders of the Universe to his audience inspired millions and opened up the doors of the imagination for them. 

For that he has my deepest gratitude and I’m honored to dedicate this episode to him. 

Until next time, thanks for watching, and have a great week!

Outward Bound: Interplanetary Trade
---
  
2017-11-02  
https://youtu.be/gRd8fR9D3-8  

---

People discuss whether or not trade between worlds will be possible in the future, in doing so they overlook that maybe it already is. 

So today we will be looking at Interplanetary Trade, and we’ll be reviewing some of the concepts we see a lot in science fiction and trying to see how practical and realistic those actually are, along with what the alternatives might be for when they aren’t. 

We will also take some time to look at interstellar trade too, and the special difficulties it imposes on us, especially if we have no access to faster than light travel or communication. 

Though we will talk about how those would affect things too. 

Trade is the lifeblood of humanity, it’s how we’ve exchanged ideas and even bloodlines for untold centuries. 

The usual alternative has been warfare, and most folks would agree the former is typically preferable to the latter. 

We have discussed a lot of the difficulties with Interplanetary Warfare so maybe we should start with the difficulties of Interplanetary Trade. 

The first difficulty is that it is interplanetary. 

Right now if you wanted to ship a package to the Martians it would cost you somewhere around $10,000 a kilogram to get it there and that is being very generous and optimistic. 

That’s usually the launch cost just to get into low orbit, though that’s an important point to mention from the outset. 

Most of the cost of moving between planets is getting off the planet in the first place, after that it only costs a lot more to move stuff to another planet if you want to get there fast or if it doesn’t have an atmosphere to help you break your speed with. 

Now there isn’t much we would be willing to ship for $10,000 a kilogram, but there are some things. 

Gold is generally valued at a few times that, as are a few other precious metals. 

Various low half-life fissionable materials like plutonium are way more valuable per kilogram than that. 

Key fusion isotopes like deuterium, tritium, and helium-3 aren’t cheap either. 

That’s just in terms of raw materials, basic elements or their isotopes for mining. 

I’m not sure how much various processors and chips run on a dollar per kilogram basis but I’d imagine many of them exceed that $10,000 per kilogram price point too. 

Of course there are no chip factories on the moon at the moment, nor anyone looking to buy them, but that’s why so much of the focus in discussing space exploration is on raw material harvesting from asteroids. 

Right now, if we saw a house-sized stack of gold ingots on the moon or an asteroid, it would indeed be profitable for us to go get them. 

And yes, even if the commodity market took a dive, since while a sudden influx of moon gold might crash prices it won’t crash them below the actual cost to go get the stuff. 

At least not for longer than it takes some analyst to notice such trips are costing us, say, $20,000 a kilogram for all costs to launch, land, mine and return home and gold prices just dropped to $19,000, and he starts screaming ‘Buy! 

Buy now!’ So don’t think of space-based trade as something limited only to the distant future and a few low-earth orbit projects like launching satellites. 

It is already in the realm of viable economics if just barely. 

Nonetheless our interest is more in the distant future when there’s actually places with people to send stuff to and from. 

Still in terms of the evolution of trade in space from now till then, I’d say you have two types of markets. 

The first is in shipping home very valuable elements as genuine commerce, bringing home gold and platinum from some asteroid. 

The second is in getting the contract to ship stuff to a colony or outpost. 

You need to eat to run a mine, and breathe, unless you are a robot, and to be honest you probably are, but if you’re not or if you are a scientist at some countries outpost on the Moon or Mars you do need food and water and air and what you can’t make there needs to be shipped in even if it costs $10,001 per kilogram, $10,000 to ship a liter bottle of water and $1 for that bottle. 

Scarcity is a relative term. 

Now as technology improves we expect the cost per kilogram to keep dropping, though as technology improves the quantity of stuff you actually need to send probably keeps dropping too, but it is also worth remembering that the most expensive place in the solar system to ship from is Earth. 

Okay, technically the Sun and all the gas giants but nobody is going to be living on those, at least not in the early days. 

Earth has a big gravity well and a thick atmosphere, which makes getting off of it dreadfully expensive. 

Though that atmosphere does make it much easier to get stuff back to it. 

If we imagined a fully developed asteroid belt, where they could make or acquire their fuel and rocket parts as cheaply as on Earth, it would actually be dirt cheap to ship back and forth between all of those. 

The Asteroid Belt is not a particularly dense place like we often see in movies, most decently sized asteroids are further apart out there than the Earth and the Moon, yet they have no gravity to speak of and it’s a case where you might intentionally burn way more fuel than you need to in order to get from Asteroid A to Asteroid B faster simply because the distances are great enough that your cost in supplies and maintenance and not using your ship for other things would be higher than your fuel costs. 

We talked about this a bit more in the Asteroid Mining episode but in summary form that is big chunk of the reason many of us foresee the Asteroid Belt as a better first step for colonization than the planets. 

On Earth, the costs of shipping goods is fairly low, but the cost increases depending on the distance something has to travel. 

The costs of shipping materials around the system will probably be more a function of the effort required to get those goods and materials out of whatever gravity well they are located on. 

This means that the cost of getting materials from planets are likely to be considerably more expensive than getting those same materials from an asteroid, where the gravity is much weaker. 

Time is also a factor. 

Most projects are time-sensitive and if it is going to take decades to get materials from the outer system, it is probably not economically feasible. 

Relatively speaking, the asteroid belt is in our neighbourhood. 

The key concept there is that you can ship stuff like food and water around the asteroid belt economically, from inside the belt anyway. 

You aren’t just limited to stuff like gold. 

And you can ship that home to Earth pretty cheaply too. 

It might cost tens of thousands of dollars to get a kilogram of ship out to an asteroid but it doesn’t cost that much to send a kilogram home if you can make the fuel there, because again that asteroid has virtually no gravity pulling stuff back toward it while Earth has an awful lot of it helping pull cargo toward it. 

Beyond those precursors of trade that we just mentioned though, real interplanetary trade has to wait till there’s places off Earth with people living there wanting stuff and making stuff. 

You can have trade then even if you are still limited to chemical rockets, but you won’t have anyone to trade with because you are not going to have great big space colonies getting setup when you are still using refined kerosene to send ships to and from. 

We will add one more caveat to that though. 

We talked about a lot of alternatives to getting off the planet in the Upward Bound series, many of which can get you into Earth Orbit for costs not much worse than flying to another continent. 

If those are setup you can move around the solar system on chemical fuels a lot cheaper, but once you have a pretty big space-based infrastructure in place you are going to be able to take a second look at nuclear propulsion because you can make bigger ships if you are building them in Orbit and people won’t worry as much about them having radioactive materials on board if they aren’t close to Earth. 

The specific economics of interplanetary trade are going to be entirely dependent on how much the ships cost in terms of speed and fuel and time and construction, but we can see four basic categories of trade. 

The first is big bulky durable cargo, where you want to go slow to save fuel. 

The second is high value trade items, which either have an expiration date or are sufficiently valuable by weight that your shipping costs are trivial. 

The third is passengers, where typically time trumps efficiency. 

These three are pretty familiar, we do them on Earth all the time and it’s why you don’t get ten tons of topsoil delivered to your house by FedEx, and why most passenger services don’t care about passenger weight much, because the costs associated to moving a person mostly are not about their weight. 

We have a fourth type too though, and that is information. 

Now that typically is not something you ship, though there’s exceptions, but this is not an episode on Interplanetary Shipping, it’s an episode on Interplanetary Trade. 

I’ve mentioned in the Outward Bound series how Mars and Venus and Saturn’s moon Titan all have stuff they want that the others have and that this includes the Asteroid Belt too. 

I left Earth out of that though, noting that Earth does not want anything those places have, except precious metals, and I also mentioned today that Earth is one of the most expensive places to ship from. 

Once you have a fully developed solar economy, one in which at least a few percent of the population does not live on or near Earth, and possibly the supermajority of them don’t, the Earth has a bit of a problem with that big gravity well. 

Now if the various engines or orbital launch megastructures are good enough that won’t matter anymore than whether or not a modern manufacturing city is by a place with good trade winds, but if it does, Earth still has one very valuable commodity to sell in exchange for whatever it wants to import home and that is information, entertainment, and so on. 

It’s going to be a long time before Earth is not the place producing the supermajority of science, let alone movies and novels and new games. 

Early on, Earth is exporting everything, because it is the only source for anything. 

Later it ships stuff too complex to manufacture locally, at least economically, and eventually it ends up exporting data. 

Now an empty ship is an empty ship so odds are even if fuel is a big factor in not wanting to export much from Earth you’d probably still do it a lot, so long as fuel isn’t crushingly expensive, but by and large we’d expect data to be Earth’s big product. 

Okay, we should talk travel times, currency, and 3D printing. 

Let’s hit printing first. 

3D printers are a wonder, they offer us the possibility of being able to manufacture almost anything without needing an assembly line. 

They do not affect three of our types of trade, bulk raw materials, passengers, or data. 

They do have a big impact on manufactured goods though. 

Your ideal asteroid colony of a few thousand people want to be able to grow all their own food, recycle all their water and air, and manufacture all their stuff, or at least the replacement parts for maintaining most of it. 

If they have something to export they may opt to buy things they could make there if they can get them cheaper elsewhere or simply use the people or robots making them for instead producing what they export in larger volumes. 

As I’ve mentioned in the past, you don’t want to think of 3D printers as magic wands, not only is there stuff they can’t print or can’t print quickly, the value of them is mostly their ability to produce things without an assembly line, not better than an assembly line. 

If that changes, this sector of interplanetary trade is going to shrink a lot. 

You only are going to trade manufactured goods when you can bulk produce stuff significantly cheaper than some printer in someone’s house can and that there is also sufficient demand for. 

Odds are for some things that will stay true and for others it won’t, so that you probably will have some trade in manufactured goods. 

Again information trade, bulk materials, and passengers will be unaffected by printers, unless you can full blown print an adult human down to their memories, but that’s basically teleportation and a topic for another day. 

Interestingly though, this means food is something you can probably trade. 

It does not take as much plant biomass to recycle the air we breathe as it does to feed a person, and if you are using that air recycling biomass for growing stuff like lettuce or other produce that doesn’t keep well then you have a market for shipping food that does stores well around to places that don’t want to grow all their own, or for that matter any. 

I always tend to assume places will recycle their air with plants because I figure they’d want some fresh veggies and fruit and something green to look at but you probably would have a fair number of facilities that just want to do that using air scrubbers and devoting all their personnel to whatever it is they do there. 

Let’s talk travel times next because currency is more relevant to interstellar trade and we’ll save that for last. 

How long does it take to get from A to B? 

Where trade is concerned the answer tends to be exactly as fast as its worth getting there. 

There’s two ways of looking at space travel in terms of time and neither of them really has much to do with actual distance. 

Either the whole things is running on available delta-v, how much you can change your speed, then plotting the shortest trip in terms of time, which often involves nothing like a straight line, or you’ve got energy to spare and it’s all about acceleration and how much you can handle. 

Timelines for the former tend to be in the years, as you carefully plot out every minimum cost orbital transfer and slingshot and need to pick your launch windows. 

That’s okay for trying to move a million tons of nitrogen from Titan to that big O’Neill Cylinder being built out in the Belt, because they will probably be busy designing and building the thing for years before people move into it. 

On the extreme other end of things if you’ve got good fusion engines that can produce delta-v of a couple percent of light speed, delta-v is no longer your issue, it’s how fast you can accelerate depending on both your engine and what your cargo can handle. 

For people as passengers that’s probably going to be 1-gee tops, though if it is important you can go higher, and with some technologies a lot higher. 

Distance gets deceptive here, when you potentially accelerate halfway there and decelerate the other half. 

This is an incredibly energy wasteful way of traveling but if you’ve got sturdy fusion reactors that can run on normal hydrogen, nobody will care, because it’s not the cost of energy that matters it’s the cost of hydrogen, the most plentiful stuff in the Universe. 

If that’s selling for a $1 a kilogram and someone tells you they can get you to Saturn in 9 days by burning a thousand kilograms of hydrogen or a month by burning only a hundred, guess which option most folks will go for, even if the amount of energy used doing it could run the entire US Power Grid for a month. 

When you’re doing that constant acceleration game at 1-gee it doesn’t take twice as long to go twice as far. 

Getting to the Moon takes less than 4 hours, the Sun is 400 times further away, at 1 AU or Astronomical Unit, but only takes 20 times longer to get to, 20^2 equaling 400. 

You’d get there in just under 3 days, To get to something 4 times further than that would take just under 6 days, twice as long, for 2^2 or 4 times the distance. 

Now the inner planets move a lot in terms of their distance relative to Earth but this tells us that using the constant 1-gee acceleration and turnover method everything in the inner solar system out to the Asteroid Belt is reachable from each other in days, a week tops. 

The outer planets don’t move as much in terms of distance from earth, proportionally, so Jupiter is 6-7 days, Saturn 9 days, Uranus 13 days, and Neptune 16 days, all plus or minus some hours. 

Now I mentioned earlier that travel times and efforts between nearest asteroids in the Belt is a lot less, and something similar applies to the collection of Moons the gas giants all have, that will be important when we get to Colonizing Jupiter later this month. 

However channel regulars know that we often talk about developing the solar system way beyond just settling planets, moons, and asteroids and constructing something called a Dyson Swarm, see the Dyson Spheres episode for more detail on that. 

When discussing those I point out that the image of a densely packed collection of orbital habitats is almost as inaccurate as the image of a big inverted shell where folks live on the inside, and that such habitats would be separated by thousands or even hundreds of thousands of kilometers from each other. 

If this is where most folks live, and where most trade goes on, transit is quite quick. 

Energy is cheap too since you can in many cases actually have a physical connection between the habitats with a tether. 

It’s cheaper than driving a car to the next town and it is an environment where people could own their own rocket ship that they drove to the neighboring habitat. 

There’s no air slowing you down so you press the gas pedal, possibly literally since very little fuel is needed and chemical rockets work just fine in this context and head on over. 

You’d get to a habitat 1000 kilometers away in just ten minutes, doing the constant one-gee with turnover rate, and reach a maximum speed of about Mach 10. 

Needless to say you could save fuel and go slower. 

Of course you could go faster, hit 3 or 4 gees. 

Doing 4 gees will halve your travel time, it follows that same square root relationship distance does. 

A lot of times you will go slower too, fuel costs in terms of both price and mass will likely always be an issue and you might find the places you want to travel to don’t want you coming in super-fast. 

Keep in mind, all those travel times assume you were slowing down, if you didn’t you’d get there faster and if you used that slow down fuel to speed up more you’d arrive even faster yet, and even just a passenger vehicle going Mach 10 would hit like it was full of explosives. 

The ones doing interplanetary trips at constant acceleration would hit like an equal weight of nukes. 

And any random bit of space garbage they hit would do the same. 

So you could have speed limits inside a solar system and I would tend to bet these would exist and be under 1% of light speed. 

Now we talked a bit about some of the issues with currency, in electronic form, and light lag issues way back in the Cryptocurrency episode but those are mostly manageable. 

You mostly had fraud issues with joint accounts for couples, groups, clones, etc. 

It’s a bit of bigger issue when we move up to interstellar trade though, especially if you are limited by the speed of light. 

What do you sell between solar systems? 

Not manufactured goods, even if 3D printing hasn’t obliterated that sector at the interplanetary scale by the time you’re engaging in interstellar trade, it’s just not very realistic to imagine that there’d be any economic advantage of mass production that would translate to those kind of times and distances. 

Information? 

Yes, that is just as valid as before, how big the market will be is hard to say, but there will be one. 

Earth ought to do well, or our solar system, in this regard as we are likely to always be a bit of a center hub for information to flow in and out of even after other systems are built up, and humanity could easily have a million settled solar systems and still have 99% of the population living back in our home system, doing almost all the science for many centuries to come. 

Passengers? 

Yes those too. 

People will want to travel if they can, some might be fine with sending a digital copy by light speed transmission but many will not be. 

Even post-biological beings might not be sanguine about that option, since as we often point out on this topic, digital mind transfer is not cut and paste, its copy and paste. 

How about raw materials? 

It is actually viable. 

Sending huge bulk freighters between solar systems carrying megatons of metal or even hydrogen can be done, and if the demand is high enough to justify the cost it might happen. 

But what exactly are you paying them with? 

What’s the money? 

Back in the Life in Space Colony series I suggested that an interstellar colony vessel is almost better employed as a sort of roving factory and people farm, not going to one system and stopping, but just pausing to drop off most of its passengers and equipment and taking on more fuel and raw materials. 

It then moves on and the remaining folks breed more colonists and spend their time manufacturing new colonization equipment for the next target system from those raw materials. 

A concern one has there with these ships, which we called Gardener Ships, is what the motivation to continue was. 

I mean those ships had crews, and a mission from Earth, but how was Earth paying them? 

That’s the first Rule of Warfare, make sure your soldiers get paid on time, and it applies to merchant marine ships and traders too. 

If your crews aren’t getting paid you probably can’t rely on them continuing to do their jobs. 

Earth has the money, no problem, but getting it usefully there is a problem. 

Maybe they can have it in an account back home collecting interest? 

The same applies for interstellar trade in general, you arrive in a system and you need to buy stuff for your ship and you need to sell stuff. 

Hypothetically you sell it for the local currency and use that to buy stuff but you have no idea what the selling rate for your cargo will be until you arrive and that’s years off. 

You get a message from a nearby system that they need colonists, especially those with a background in chemistry, and that they’ll pay handsomely for them. 

You load up interested people, presumably agreeing to split that reward fee to pay for their passage, and arrive twenty years later only to find out they instituted a new educational policy to train more chemists and no longer need the ones you brought. 

It doesn’t even matter that you might get news en route, because unlike interplanetary ships with fusion engines, interstellar ones do not accelerate the whole way, they mostly coast. 

So once they are en route they are en route. 

They can’t just slow down and turn around because they only have the fuel to slow down, they probably have some reserves that might be enough to steer them toward another system further off in the same general direction but that’s it. 

These sorts of problems are serious issues with interstellar trade that might prevent it ever being more than a bit of novelty, though the sheer population size of a solar system, even one that hasn’t gone full Kardashev 2 Dyson Swarm, is enough to support a lot of novelty and you might still have ships arriving regularly, even if they represented not a percent of a percent of the gross system economy. 

I’ve never heard anyone satisfactorily overcome these issues, and it’s arguably even more severe when discussing interstellar empires, which we will look at next month, but they could be solvable. 

After all it remains a topic mostly discussed in science fiction and that usually has faster than light travel or at least communication. 

Of course if you do have FTL, Faster Than Light Travel, it makes a big difference. 

As would also be the case if you only had FTL communications. 

We could do a whole episode just on the various permutations of how trade would work depending on a given FTL system but a few deserve mention for circumventing the norm. 

In Orson Scott Card’s Ender’s Game series we only have light speed travel but instant communication. 

This has the interesting effect of allowing essentially all information to be available anywhere anywhen, same as with the modern internet, which the books mostly predate. 

We never want to forget that trade, especially for high tech civilizations, tends to be as much in information as actual goods. 

Also in a civilization which has gone postbiological, you can send a copy of yourself anywhere instantaneously this way. 

Another example that tosses out the normal convention of spaceships plying the space lanes is wormholes. 

The classic theoretical wormhole can't be on a planet because they are insanely massive, but most fictional portrayals treat it as a simple portal window from point A to B. 

Such being the case, there’s no need to have them in space when you can just have them on a planet. 

We see an example of that in the Stargate Franchise, but we get another example in Peter Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga where they aren’t portals people walk through but through which they drive whole freight trains. 

They don’t even initially have spaceships because they’re mostly worthless to them. 

We talked about that technology more in the Wormholes episode, but from a trade perspective you can use wormholes for other things like disposing of garbage or waste heat, or for providing raw materials or energy by opening a portal up to the molten metal core of another planet or a star. 

That’s a point to always remember, we know the kind of Black Swan disruptions we can get to an economy and civilization in general from a new technology, obvious in hindsight but totally surprising at the time. 

However science fiction is often bad about introducing technologies that have some very obvious consequences that the writers missed or ignored. 

In a Star Trek style Universe with replicators there should be no ships that don’t exist to either move people around or raw materials around, because there’s no need for manufacturing or agriculture, and since there should be no materials only available in one system, you would not expect any interstellar vessels meant for any purpose other than defense, exploration, and passenger or colonist carrying. 

You also wouldn’t expect there to be commercial hub systems or space piracy unless the FTL system required specific paths, because space is ridiculously huge and while the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, it is a constantly moving straight line for interstellar paths and more like a very wide corridor probably several billion kilometers in diameter, which you can easily widen a whole order of magnitude if you need to worry about pirates. 

Try as I might, I’ve never been able to figure out a way in which space piracy could work outside of very specific fictional FTL systems. 

There’s just no rivers or currents or mountain passes that make an ideal place to both hide and expect traffic through. 

We might revisit interstellar trade more in the future and we will be revisiting interstellar civilizations next month, but while interstellar trade in anything but information seems dubious under known physics, it is possible. 

And as we’ve seen today, interplanetary trade certainly is, even with just the technology we have now or on the near-horizon. 

Next week will be exploring interstellar space some more in the Cosmic Ocean, and the week after that we will be looking at Mega-Earths, artificial planets that dwarf our own homeworld, and which potentially can be provide more living area than most interstellar empires we see in fiction.

Digital Death

2017-10-26  
https://youtu.be/6icg0tu_5z4  

---

There’s nothing more certain than taxes and death, but in the future, maybe not the latter. 

We’ve discussed concepts like life extension before, and last week we discussed mind augmentation. 

Most people have at least a passing familiarity with the notion that you might be able to backup or upload your mind to a computer and in that way live forever, or pretty close to it. 

In the Civilizations at the End of Time series we’ve discussed the ways a civilization might outlast the very stars themselves and, indeed, potentially flourish and prosper on a scale that would make the entire stellar phase of the Universe seem like a brief prelude. 

In that regard, we are barely into the first sentence of that prelude. 

Humanity has existed for only an eyeblink of time compared to the Universe as a whole, and it is still quite young. 

We are about 1% of 1% of the way through the period of time in which stars will form and die, and the period of time in which humanity has been around is only about 1% of 1% of that. 

Recorded human history is even shorter, just a percent of the time humanity has been around, while the individual human lifespan is about a percent of that. 

Only about a hundred generations have passed since the Roman Empire was at its peak, and the dawn of recorded history lies only about as far again back from then. 

For most of that time, people typically did not die of old age, and even what folks meant by old age included a lot of circumstances we no longer view as natural causes of a long life. 

At the age of 37, I have already outlived the supermajority of all humans who have ever lived, yet barring unexpected illness or accident, I should have just as much time left to me. 

When we start talking about human lifespan extension people often recoil from the idea as rather fantastic, but it is worth remembering that many of the things that used to kill people regularly in the past have been outright eliminated or reduced to being exceptionally rare. 

Those people living when such causes were normal, indeed, more likely than dying of old age, might have considered their elimination rather fantastic too. 

We are just getting to the point where technology is hinting at ways to extend someone’s life enormously, potentially without any limit, so contemplation of this topic tends to fall into two chief attitudes. 

The first is disbelief, while the second is total acceptance, immortality is possible, and perhaps even folks alive nowadays might enjoy it, not simply folks living in some distant future. 

This is our topic for today, because we need to contemplate some serious impediments to extremely long life that come into play once simple aging is no longer an ultimate expiration date on your existence. 

Over a long enough period of time you are likely to have some sort of accident kill you, or to be murdered. 

Even if your odds were only one in a million every year, you’d have a fifty-fifty chance of dying in the next 700,000 years and less than a 1% chance to make it to five million. 

Now most folks would shrug at that, that’s a lifespan on a timeline as long as humanity has been around, more than enough, but it’s important to keep in mind you need to do way better on your survival odds if you want to be seeing the End of the World. 

Typically folks would suggest you probably want to either get a digital backup of your mind or go entirely digital yourself. 

Now it’s kind of debatable if you, yourself, can actually go digital or if you are really just making a copy of yourself, and that’s an important distinction since if you don’t view that copy as you, you might prefer to just have a copy that can go live if you die. 

Many folks debate whether or not such a copy is you, but whether or not it is, it's not something you can really prove or disprove. 

Regardless, what matters is whether or not you think it is. 

But even that doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t get backed up if the option is easily available, since a person has reason to want a copy of themselves for more than personal continuity. 

Putting it bluntly, most of us have stuff we’re willing to die for: friends, family, causes, etc. 

But we also have stuff we’re willing to live for, or in this case, be resurrected for. 

Most of us have people or projects we would not want to see ourselves absent from; I would like to know this channel would go on if I fell over dead tomorrow, and the most obvious successor to operate it is me. 

Nobody’s going to finish writing that novel you’ve been working on or tend that garden you’ve spent years improving, not the way you would. 

Most of us have something like this we deeply care about, and that’s not even including our friends and family, let alone our kids. 

This isn’t some cliché scifi horror novel either; that copy of you isn’t going to go home to your spouse and little ones and turn demonic. 

It is you, it isn’t an ‘it’. 

It might be on a TV monitor for a while or in some sophisticated android till a body is grown, or re-grown. 

Barring murder, in a civilization that can backup memories, odds are only massive brain damage that shreds almost everything will keep you dead, but it would be nice if the tiny little robots repairing your neural connections had a backup copy to look at as a blueprint. 

I’ve heard folks suggest they’d be freaked out by a copy of a dead family member, and that’s an entirely legitimate response, but that’s because we’re not used to it. 

We’re very good at believing what we want to be true, and by default we suspect such a thing only because it’s too good to be true and because we’ve seen a lot of horror movies about bringing back the dead and it going all wrong. 

We’ve got a lot more reasons to want to believe it’s really them or close enough, both from a personal desire and a strictly scientific perspective, so I’d rather imagine most folks will increasingly tilt to regard them as a true copy or even just the original who was away for a bit in the hospital. 

So there’s a lot of reasons to have such a backup around and not many reasons not to. 

Lots of potential problems too. 

Fortunately, one that isn’t too big a problem is storage space. 

While the human mind is still a more potent processor than our best supercomputers, even if that gap is almost closed, human memory storage is estimated to be in the area of 10 terabytes to perhaps 10 petabytes, and you can buy 10 Terabyte hard drives these days. 

A modest gain in hard drive capacity and cost will permit affordable storage of data equal to even that higher end estimate of human memory. 

Right now you could buy the lower end value for a few hundred bucks, and the higher end for around a quarter of a million dollars. 

We never want to fall into the trap of thinking that Moore’s Law and its parallels for other aspects of computing like memory is an actual law. 

There are no guarantees we will get computers even one penny cheaper per unit of memory or processors than we have right now, but I think we can assume that by the time we have brain scanning technology we will have at least another order of magnitude or two knocked off the price per byte of memory. 

Such being the case, the actual storage cost for a copy of a human mind should be affordable even if it is that higher end, 10 petabyte value, and of course 10 terabytes already is. 

What this means is that we have every good reason to believe we could store a human mind on something smaller than a human brain and a good deal cheaper than most annual life insurance premiums. 

A good analogy perhaps too, since a backup is essentially a type of life insurance. 

You get those to take care of your loved ones after you’re gone, a backup of you does the job better. 

But it also means you can probably have a ton of backups, especially if memory gets a lot cheaper. 

Most likely the cost bottleneck would be all about the transmissions themselves, and of course the scanning equipment. 

In a realistic scenario, your default 22nd-century individual, who is a little bit of a cyborg, probably has a mind–machine interface that can double as a brain scanner. 

Let’s use a specific case, we’ll say Steve from Austin, Texas. 

Steve has neural lace woven around in his brain and scanners in his skull and little nanomachines that help to monitor and repair his brain. 

They tend to do most of their work at night and he doesn’t use his bandwidth much then so they assemble a snapshot of his brain and transmit it to a hard drive implanted into his leg bone with a fiber optic running down to it. 

That’s his first backup, though really there’s one already in his head, but it’s ever shifting and not much of a backup since it would likely be damaged by whatever damaged his brain. 

Steve’s pretty tough and those little nanobots could probably repair his brain on their own if he got stabbed in the skull, probably without even having to check that backup black box in his leg. 

He’s also not really worried about losing a day’s worth of memory, so he only updates his backup at night, once a day. 

But he is transmitting all the time, like most people he has a deadman switch constantly monitoring his lifesigns and recording sound and video near him for his secure storage, that will be transmitted to a security company and then the police if anything goes wrong. 

He can always watch those recordings if he loses that last day of memory too. 

Whatever amount of bandwidth you might need for transmitting a backup is way more than a few megabytes of video, audio, and biometric data. 

Of course when Steve sends his backup daily, to a local datahub or warehouse, he doesn’t send a whole copy of his brain, even if that is only 10 Terabytes that’s still a lot of data to send down the wire or wirelessly. 

He’s probably just transmitting a comparison of his current mind with his last copy and filing those changes. 

All the new neuron connections and changes in potential and such. 

Now Steve is a bit paranoid, so from that datahub the data gets sent to two different companies, each of which keeps its own redundant backups too. 

If you are in the brain-copying business, you want to make sure you’ve got a reputation for having giant armored vaults with backups and the kind of security that makes Fort Knox look like a convenience store. 

He’s got two backups against those companies failing. 

It’s like with getting yourself frozen, folks ask what you should invest your money in to make sure you still have some when you get thawed out, to which the answer is, the company that froze you. 

If they are successfully thawing people out, their stock is probably looking pretty hot, and if their stock isn’t too hot, you probably ain’t staying too cold, so the status of your investments is the last thing on your mind, or what’s left of it. 

Multiple redundancies, prior copies that haven’t been updated for a while just in case someone has been tampering with your uploads or even hijacked your implants to send static or gibberish so they could kill you later when all those stored copies are gibberish too. 

Encryptions on those transmissions, regular checks with the technicians to make sure all is well. 

This makes somebody very hard to kill, for keeps. 

They can still get your body of course, one immediate application of this technology is that you can copy your mind into an android and go shoot someone with a death ray that disintegrates them. 

That would probably be a pretty common form of interplanetary tourism too, since it’s faster and probably cheaper to get your brain scanned over to an android on another planet for a while. 

You might get some interesting companies that provided anonymous brain scan storage or don’t ask don’t tell android rental. 

Though I think you could still track them. 

But if you’ve got that tech you also have off planet storage too, just having androids sophisticated enough to handle a human brain copied into them grants you way easier off-planet construction abilities, but that’s not too relevant, since all the tech needed for such things allows really good automation and self-replication anyway. 

So Steve’s other copies are off at the Hyperion Data Repository on Titan, and with a small city-state in the asteroid belt that is the Swiss Bank of the Brain Biz. 

Those only get copied once a week, but they keep 100 prior versions before copying over and Steve assumes that he only needs those if either Earth is getting blown up or someone has engaged in an elaborate murder conspiracy against him. 

At least that’s what Steve’s wife Jaime thinks. 

Steve is pretty paranoid so he actually has a third copy she doesn’t know about that he only transmits once a month and never from home. 

After all, no encryption is ever safe from someone with the password or access to the account a password reset goes to. 

Steve heard of a man killed by his wife after they had a very bad argument, where she didn’t want him dead, just wanted his memory of the argument erased. 

Steve’s fairly normal as folks go, in terms of paranoia and backups, he’s not a secret agent or a test pilot or something dangerous that might get his body incinerated. 

But he’s pretty hard to kill, and indeed probably a lot less likely to die, permanently, than one in a million per year. 

It can pretty much only happen to him if he is murdered, and we already have a fair few places where the murder rate is nearly that low. 

As we said at those odds your half-life was about 700,000 years. 

So he might live quite a long time, with even lower odds. 

This is even bigger for strictly digital entities, especially ones that don’t feel a need for speed. 

As we’ve mentioned many a time before, the signals running around your brain generally move slower than the speed of sound, often a lot slower, and it’s only a millionth the speed of light. 

If you copied a human brain exactly, but spaced out to run at light speed but at the human rate of consciousness, that brain would be the size of a planet. 

Now you’d probably have that bundled into all sorts of nodes but it means someone can spread their intelligence all over the planet and still maintain the normal human rate of thought without needing a single extra bit of total processing power. 

That’s a very hard target to take out, when they might have a dozen redundancies for every node and thousands or even millions of such nodes. 

This doesn’t even include actual backup copies of them elsewhere or even running clones. 

There’s a million asteroids in the Belt big enough to make comfortable city-states for regular humans, and they could easily have tons more entirely digital people running around in the background, potentially with their consciousness distributed over several light seconds. 

And if you don’t mind going slower, or adding more processing, you could potentially distribute your awareness like a gas cloud spread over entire solar systems or other solar systems. 

If your big goal is to survive as long as the stars or longer, you might not mind if a thought took a year, if it protected you from pretty much any conceivable attack. 

Helps with boredom too, one of those big threats to continued existence. 

That’s the big one of course. 

How do you kill an immortal? 

In a fantasy novel, they’ve presumably got some special weakness, ya know, throw their precious ring into a volcano, or there’s a magic sword that can kill them. 

We don’t get those in the real world, but hypothetically, you could get them with some virus that corrupted them and their copies, they presumably need access to those. 

But they might have disconnected backups or ones that were read only in someone else’s vault as a last fallback. 

You could go get all those storage repositories, but you need to know where they all are. 

You need to be able to blow them up. 

You need to be able to deal with the issue that other people are probably on those too, and you need to get them all at once or inside the time window light lag provides or they’ll just copy elsewhere. 

And all the security for this is to protect human lives, many human lives, so odds are you are going up against tons of the best minds around who designed those security systems. 

Barring such options, how can you kill an immortal? 

The easiest way is to get them to kill themselves. 

There’s more to that than simple suicide, but we can start there. 

People probably do not want copies of their minds floating around that they don’t know about or don’t have access to. 

That is your privacy after all, so having some backup you’ve removed from your own memories triggered to go off if you committed suicide would seem a special level of paranoia, and you can’t update it all the time or you will need to know about it or otherwise leave evidence it exists, so you could be losing years or decades of memory. 

Excluding that as probably uncommon and impractical, a person should be able to kill themselves, and it’s unlikely any court would rule that any decision you made in the past, like a clause preventing you from wiping your backups, was something you couldn’t invalidate. 

Maybe though, you might have some weird cases of divergent multiple persons with the same original mind where one tried to delete the original backups and got refused. 

Now it sounds kind of absurd that you could talk someone into killing themselves without overt mind control, but two notes on that. 

First, while I always say I can’t imagine ever getting bored with life to the point of wanting to end it, that is the most common rebuttal to life extension I tend to hear when we discuss the topic. 

Folks would get bored and choose to die. 

I, of course, always say that’s their own business and doesn’t have any relevance to whether or not such tech should be developed or if other people should be allowed to use it. 

I also don’t think most people would get bored either, but I could be wrong. 

Add to that, we expect psychology to keep improving especially when we are at the brain scan and emulation level. 

A trained expert working on someone who was already kind of bored might be able to talk them into ending themselves. 

They almost have to have access to every recent backup at least of their mind, so they can delete those. 

You could have things in place to prevent suicide, if you were worried that you might be struck by extreme but temporary depression at some point in a multi-million year life. 

But you probably don’t want strong anti-suicide restraints in place either, considering you could end up being truly immortal to the point you can’t even kill yourself. 

Your core architecture prevents you from even trying. 

That’s how you end up a trillion-year old miserable entity trapped for all eternity, potentially even driven to steal resources from others to keep going after the stars are gone because your internal mental monitors regard that as akin to starving yourself to death and are allowed to force you to eat. 

It’s a little chilling to imagine a dark and cooling Universe populated only by resource raiders cannibalizing each other, and in some ways that seems even worse if each of them is secretly grateful when they lose and can finally die. 

So while you might want to build in time constraints on deleting backups, waiting periods to confirm the request and so forth, you still probably want that option. 

If it is there that’s one way to get an immortal, persuading them to take a nihilistic view of life or even just convincing them that life will be exciting again with real dangers and few to no backups. 

Of course at a fundamental level, if your psychology is getting that good, and so is your neuroscience, you might be able to ‘kill’ them just by changing them. 

Fundamental life changes can have a big effect on a person, and permeate out to change their attitudes on all sorts of things. 

And that’s without precision psychology or the ability to simply delete a given desire. 

For a digital entity, one can presumably be sufficiently in control to flip a switch that makes you like chocolate and hate strawberries, where before you didn’t like chocolate and loved those berries. 

You don’t have to move fast either, revenge is a dish best served cold, and you are presumably just as immortal as they are. 

If it takes you a million years of subtle manipulation to effectively kill off the old persona with one so different it doesn’t act the least bit the same, what do you care? 

Which brings us to our last point. 

You can use all these methods to extend your life indefinitely, but how much is that person really you? 

Yes, the changes are gradual, but does that really matter? 

In general, we also have this same concern with Transhumanism. 

If you boost the mind up to superhuman levels, is what remains actually you or did that person die? 

Not a seed the tree grew out of but just the decaying logs of a previous trees it used for nutrients and root structure? 

This is one reason I can imagine for why people might skip on mental augmentation or super long lives. 

They just don’t believe that final product would be them, because it's beyond simple gradual change so that the final person is no more them then we are the various dirt and microorganisms that were around when the dinosaurs roamed the planet. 

Now you could put safeguards in to prevent such major changes, to make sure you never drifted outside the acceptable ranges of thought and behavior you wanted. 

Have certain things hardwired as it were. 

Or you might use resets, effectively being like Leonard Shelby from Christopher Nolan’s Memento, the reverse of the groundhog day where you keep repeating the same day, but remember it; here you keep experiencing new days, but forget the previous ones. 

Something like that could happen just from not being able to contain all your memories, not just running out of space for them but for the indexing system you use to recall a billion years’ worth of life. 

Faced with options like that, a lot of folks might decide enough is enough and opt to shut down, not from boredom, but from recognition that they just weren’t the same person anymore, and either they archive all those old memories entirely outside their new mind or just end it entirely. 

Either way that original person is gone. 

That’s a fairly dismal outlook on eternity, but this is our Halloween episode after all. 

There could be solutions too, we’ve hardly explored the options in detail for this problem we can’t experience yet anyway, and figuring those out will give future generations something to do so they don’t get bored. 

For mind uploading, I would expect it to be a pretty major sector of interplanetary trade, our topic for next week, simply because if it becomes normal, most folks would want a backup far from where they lived. 

It will also play a big role in how people approach warfare in the future too, when we revisit that topic early next year.

Mind Augmentation

Throughout history we’ve used our minds to build and improve things, but soon we'll be able to build things that improve our minds. 

We’ve been trying to come up with ways to enhance the human mind for at least as long as humanity has had a concept for intelligence, and in all that time we haven’t had a lot of success doing it. 

We have had no shortage of potions and concoctions meant to enhance the mind, and some like coffee at least partially work. 

We’ve no shortage of drugs that alter the mind either. 

Yet for all that it has been a popular notion in fiction, even before we had science fiction, the science of it has eluded us. 

That’s changing, and becoming an emerging reality with the technologies on the horizon and companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink pushing to bring mind augmentation from fiction to fact. 

We have seen it more and more in science fiction too, with authors attempting to paint a portrait of what a future would be like where mind augmentation was common. 

My own favorite for this is the Revelation Space series, by Alastair Reynolds. 

With possible exception of Isaac Asimov there is no author who has more heavily influenced me and this channel, so I’m proud to announce it as our SFIA October Book of the Month, sponsored by Audible. 

You can grab a great audio version of Revelation Space by using my link Audible.com/Isaac, or click on the link in the description below. 

That gets you a free audio book and a 30 day free trial of Audible. 

We’ve been exploring the concept of artificial intelligence recently and will continue to do so in the coming months, discussing both creating human level artificial intelligence and superhuman level. 

Yet, we shouldn’t overlook the possibility that even as we are making machines smarter than humans, we might be able to make smarter humans too. 

This is an enormous topic, both the means to potentially do it, and the types of ways to do it. 

Let’s explore some of the boundaries of mind augmentation. 

We’ll begin with nootropic drugs. 

These are marketed as “smart drugs” or “cognitive enhancers”. 

Mostly, these tend to be stimulants, but can also involve depressants or attention focusers. 

The general idea is to make use of a stimulant to increase mental arousal to increase performance. 

The trouble is that increasing arousal beyond a certain point actually decreases performance. 

The trick is to keep the mind in its highest performing state, basically the performance Goldilocks zone of the mind, by playing with the arousal levels. 

I mention this way to achieve mind augmentation because it exists today and it is estimated that sales of nootropic supplements exceeds $1 billion a year, so it is being taken seriously by many folks. 

The trouble is getting into the Goldilocks zone and staying there. 

Different tasks require different levels of arousal for optimal performance. 

Intellectually demanding tasks generally need a lower level of arousal, which helps with concentration. 

In contrast, tasks demanding staying power may be performed better with higher levels of arousal. 

We don’t tend to have only one type of task in our day and moving into a different task can take you out of the Goldilocks zone. 

Another problem is that the drugs themselves take time to be processed by the body and reach the brain, different drugs have different release rates and staying in the Goldilocks zone is more of an art form than a science. 

The final big elephant in the room is that there are side effects. 

Some of the drugs can be habit-forming or affect blood pressure, sexual function, sleep and mood. 

There are many nootropic drugs and the effects, especially long term effects, of specific drugs alone and in combination is often not well understood. 

Having said that, the nootropic group of drugs includes caffeine and nicotine. 

As you know, I consider the coffee machine to be one of our best inventions. 

Nootropic drugs also include some outlawed or tightly controlled drugs, like amphetamines. 

The use of nootropic drugs is controversial and so is its status as a mind augmentation. 

Improving performance through the use of drugs might not actually be mind augmentation because all you have done is to make use of the mind’s own ability to perform by adjusting arousal. 

Beyond nootropic drugs, we enter a more murky world of future possibilities. 

These include neurosurgery, advanced education methods and cybernetic implants. 

As to intelligence enhancement, we could have increases to general intelligence or a massive increase to one type, such as making someone a savant, maybe even an autistic savant, if that increase came by diverting other parts of the mind to assist. 

We might speed up how fast an individual thinks or give them implants that helped with some task or even network minds together, if we develop a Brain-Machine Interface with enough bandwidth. 

That last one, in its more extreme form, is called a Hive Mind and we’ll look at that in a month or so, and it could be everything from a limited network like any human community is, up to some connection so extreme, that it replaces the individual components with a single new entity, in much the same way you and I are people, and our kidneys, livers, and stomachs are not. 

One of the methods to augment a mind is presumably hooking it up to computers, directly interfaced into the head or just wirelessly interfacing with them. 

Such an augmentation could be so integral to you that you considered it part of your mind, or it might be clearly separate from your mind, but still be part of you, same as your hands or eyes. 

Or it could be more separate yet, just a tool or garment, like your shoes, or a screwdriver. 

There’s a fair number of examples of this in fiction, but I’m fond of the term E-Butler, from Peter Hamilton’s Commonwealth Saga, which is a fairly smart but not sentient computer assistant most folks have among their mental implants. 

It’s clever enough to help with tons of tasks so it’s somewhere between a personal secretary and a smartphone, and it is in your head and it is customized to you. 

It could just as easily also be a separate entity entirely, an artificial intelligence. 

If I gave you a mental implant that allowed you to access the contents of an entire encyclopedia most would say that was mind augmentation, but then again maybe not as mere knowledge is not intelligence. 

We probably would consider it augmentation if it was integrated thoroughly enough into the brain that you could shuffle through the contents of it as casually as we can shuffle through our memories of some topic or skill we have and allow us to apply that knowledge easily. 

Analogies between computers and brains are tricky, but are common because it’s about our only option. 

Where a computer ends is hard to define, you could limit it just to the processor but you can have more than one of those, or maybe just the stuff on the motherboard, or just inside the case, like the skull, the hard drive counts but then an external hard drive would not. 

What about the monitor and other peripherals like the keyboard and mouse? 

Our brain is a bit like that. 

The skull, like the computer case, isn’t an entirely arbitrary boundary, but is also not an ideal one, and the mind is even hazier than the brain. 

Sticking an implant in there isn’t automatically making it part of your mind anymore than if I stick a needle in there, and if we removed part of your brain and stuck in some support system connected by wires to the stuff still in your skull, we would say that’s still your mind. 

Something like modifying our spinal cords to accelerate our reflexes through reflex conditioning or actively tapping into the motoneurons and interneurons might be considered mind augmentation, even though our brain has nothing to do with it, or simply body modification, again where you draw the boundaries is a gray area. 

Obviously enhancing your memory would count as augmenting the mind, and if you record everything you experience with cameras and a decent indexing system you can achieve fairly similar results. 

Again, there’s a hazy boundary between a useful tool and an actual mental augmentation. 

As to memory enhancement, that comes in a lot of forms too. 

Better storage of course, a bigger hard drive as it were, faster recall, better search and indexing methods, higher resolution of those images or sounds or smells you remember, stronger association of various relevant memories, and so on. 

Try to remember the last time you took a test on paper. 

Might have been yesterday, much of my audience is in college, but it might have been a lot longer. 

The last one I can remember was my ASVAB to join the military 14 years ago. 

It’s easier to recall in some respects since that’s an important one not a quick pop quiz for an elective course. 

What was the topic? 

Decent chance you can remember that. 

Did you use a pen or a pencil? 

If a pen, what color was it? 

If a pencil, was it the wooden kind with an eraser stub or a mechanical one? 

Was the eraser worn down? 

Did you have a coffee or soda at hand? 

A bottle of water? 

A backpack? 

I can remember those mostly because that is what came to mind to ask about. 

Thinking on the event I remember being irritated by not having my normal mechanical pencil and the eraser being worn down, being irked not having a coffee to sip. 

The more I think on it the more I remember but at the same time the more my mind wanders to parallel, associated events. 

Thinking about the entire process of memory reminds us of all the various important aspects and components of it that exceed a simple recording of a video. 

It would be awesome to have a far better memory, one that let someone ask you what kind of birthday cake you had for your 10th birthday and just be able to give the answer as quickly and casually as if they asked us when our birthday was. 

You could recall not just the information, but maybe even be able to relive the event like you were there. 

It would be potentially dangerous too. 

Not only could you get stuck dwelling on pleasant events of the past but you could get stuck reliving traumatic or negative events. 

That raises the entire issue of removing bad memories or implanting fake positive memories, another popular one in science fiction that we see in films like Total Recall. 

And a proper memory of an event isn’t just the visual or audio component, it’s the smells, the textures, the actual emotions going on. 

Such things tend to dim with time, but imagine if every time you saw a blue sedan, you remember vividly the time you crashed your blue sedan and were stuck in it for twenty agonizing minutes till the firemen cut you free. 

That would be awful, so would freshly remembering the loss of a grandparent, or a friend, or a pet, like it happened yesterday. 

Mind augmentations can come with some serious downsides, even ignoring the side effects they could have. 

A positive might come at the price of a negative, but sometimes having a new skill or talent can come with negatives. 

Learn a lot of science and some science fiction isn’t as fun to watch anymore. 

Get better hearing and a street musician striking some off chords might grate on you like nails on a chalkboard, so that you might want to be able to dial down or switch off some augmentation. 

More importantly though, the brain isn’t a processor with carefully designed software. 

We talk about the architecture of the human mind like we do software architecture, but that’s a dubious term. 

Your brain certainly has structure to it, but in the same way a forest or jungle does. 

Much like how an ecosystem can have massive changes from mild tweaks, the human mind and personality might be very sensitive to small changes. 

So early augmentation probably wants to avoid messing much with the architecture of our minds. 

You can go for non-mind augmentation, like just hijacking the optic nerve to send information through as a visual input, and some others to serve as an output, both to other devices that do some work. 

You could go the neural lace route perhaps, something that doesn’t alter thinking but pretty much is a net of detectors woven throughout the mind to read your thoughts, send that data for processing, and send it back as an input. 

Another option is to augment reflexes using the comparatively much simpler neural pathways in the spinal cord. 

Or bypass the spinal cord completely, as is currently being developed for people with spinal injuries. 

As to making someone smarter without messing with that architecture, two of the methods are just making it bigger or speeding it up. 

We see both examples in books by Alastair Reynolds though one is in a sequel to the book of the month and the other is in a standalone novel. 

For the former, speeding it up, you could potentially replace all the slow signal transmission lines in the brain, which move anywhere from walking speed to bullet speed, with stuff that moves at the speed of light. 

We talked about that option more in the Transhumanism and Cyborg episodes, so I won’t repeat it now, but this is what gets classified as Speed Intelligence, one of the three types of Super Intelligence identified by Nick Bostrom in his book Super-Intelligence. 

The other two types being Networked Intelligence, which we’ll look at more in the Hive Minds episode, and Quality Intelligence, which is a hazy concept but basically the reason why you are better at many tasks than a room full of monkeys, even though they’ve got more combined brain matter than you do. 

Another author, my friend Dennis E. Taylor, calls accelerating thought speed “frame-jacking” in his “We are Bob” novels, and I like the term so I’ll borrow it for the notion of speeding your thoughts up but not constantly, just as much as is needed at that time. 

This is essentially how fast you are experience time. 

Frame-jacking would tend to drive you nuts if you were always existing at a time rate where seconds seemed to take hours to pass. 

So while you might be comfortable running a bit faster than normal all the time, you probably won’t want to speed up very fast for more than short periods. 

Also, by and large you’d expect everyone else to have this and for a new standard pace to develop. 

This is clearly beneficial too. 

Being able to crank people’s brains up to run a million times faster obviously helps with scientific research a lot and you have way less accidents if folks can respond almost instantly to them. 

But it would start messing with our concept of time a lot too. 

Someone tells you they were born in 1980 and another tells you they were born in 1987, and you know one is 7 years younger than the other person. 

But the fellow born in 1987 might have experienced a couple centuries of thought last year. 

These are the same kinds of issues we experience with relativistic travel, where time genuinely slows down for the traveler, or freezing people in sci fi. 

You could have someone who went around on a spaceship that hugged the speed of light, so whole decades might pass during their journey while they only experienced a year or so, and they could be engaging in interstellar trade for centuries but only feel like they have been in the business for a few years. 

Or they might accelerate their consciousness, frame-jack, to experience the same amount of time as passed in the outside world or even more of it. 

It’s a neat trick for growing soldiers too. 

Scifi loves to have tank grown super-soldiers you can pump out in months from some cloning vat but tends to ignore that they aren’t getting much training in that time. 

Fully grown or not, a two-month old is a two-month old. 

They aren’t even talking and walking. 

If you can speed up their thoughts though, you can teach them faster, or just take regular people and hand them some books on the topic and tell them to read them now. 

Obviously it needs to be an electronic book or better some virtual simulation with hands-on training, but now they suddenly know the skill. 

Doesn’t feel like it to them though, because they did actually spend the time to learn it. 

You might expect everybody with this option would go and try to learn everything, but first off, most people do have a plenty of free time and still don’t hit the books to learn skills they don’t particularly need at the moment. 

Second, this is one pathway to extreme life extension, you only live maybe a century of real time but experience thousands of years of subjective time, and while we are keeping to a basic human mental architecture, even if we can extend their useful memory so their brain doesn’t fill up or overwrite old memories, there’s a cost to life. 

Firstly, you probably want to get paid more for an hour spent frame-jacking than at normal speed, since you are experiencing it, so our ideas about being paid by the hour changes. 

Living 20,000 subjective years when you are physically 20 might seem like a gradual change made to your mind over subjective years spent reading stuff while you sat down on the couch for a few minutes, but to everyone else it won’t be the least bit gradual. 

Do you think if we stuck you in a slow time pocket for a century in a library to read, you would emerge the same person as far as your friends were concerned? 

All that new knowledge, probably even talking differently? 

How do you feel about the spouse you married and haven’t really talked to from your perspective in a decade? 

How do they feel about you? 

Understanding that, you might get very touchy about frame-jacking a lot. 

So speed intelligence is a promising path to mind augmentation but not without its problems. 

The nicer path when you just want it for learning is to copy all the information over, but the brain, and anything functioning on the neural network concept, is not particularly suited to copy and paste. 

There’s a big difference between photographing a book page and actually learning its contents, absorbing it and doing all the new wiring and indexing so you can recall and utilize it. 

The last aspect though returns to the continuity of identity issue. 

With something like speed intelligence you are just being changed gradually, from your own perspective, but suddenly spiking someone’s intelligence up 20 IQ points probably changes them profoundly, and pumping them up to hundreds of times smarter than the normal person ought to change their psychology more than going from standard primate to human. 

A lot of people might not like that, even if they wanted to be that smart, because they might seriously doubt they were that smart, that we instead have an entirely new entity and they ceased to exist. 

Folks also sometimes kick around the notion, usually in terms of the Fermi Paradox, that what we consider intelligence is sort of a form of insanity. 

We don’t know that getting a bit smarter might not be a very bad thing. 

People worry about civilizations being too dumb to survive or getting dumber and dying off. 

But getting smarter might get you too. 

You could potentially have a civilization fall apart simply because its members were so smart they were constantly being overwhelmed by existential crises. 

They might get depressed or conclude free will and existence were logically impossible or pointless, but were too smart to ignore it or rationalize a way around it, and just sit down and shut off. 

A popular notion is that civilizations run on a lot of stupidity and it would seem like if it were actually true then one with a lot of mind augmentation might fall apart. 

Personally, I don’t see it that way. 

But then if I didn’t think making people smarter was almost always a good thing I wouldn’t spend so much time learning myself or teaching, so I might be biased, and education itself is the oldest method of mind augmentation and has a very good track record for performance. 

I think we will see mind augmentation of various types and levels start showing up in the next few decades and I would expect it to have positive effects overall. 

Another example of augmentation is just making the brain bigger, but keeping the same overall architecture. 

It has the downside of slowing things down. 

And we get an example of that from the House of Suns where the protagonist spends a decade talking to a human giant with a massive head who is incredibly smart but slow. 

It takes hours for them to send around all the mental signals between all those many neurons which are far apart and formulate a simple thought but it’s not a very simple thought either. 

It has to go slow too because every time you fire a neuron you generate heat and your radiating surface is not scaling up with volume and quantity. 

Double a skull’s diameter and you get eight times the volume and neurons but only four times the radiating surface. 

Now, we don’t have a lot of technical detail yet on how we can achieve mind augmentation, but whatever way we do that, that last point brings us to the familiar territory of having to deal with the laws of thermodynamics. 

We get an example of folks who have had cooling fins installed to help dissipate heat from thinking faster in another of Alastair Reynold’s novels. 

You can see why I like him for this topic. 

When we talk about really speeding up intelligence a lot that heat issue is a big one, though come to think of it restrictions on technology imposed by heat and thermodynamics is probably one of the most common obstacles I point out on this channel, probably because it gets ignored in science fiction so much. 

We do have super computers these days finally powerful enough that they process as fast as our estimates for the human mind, which is still several million times faster than your typical home computer. 

These things are gluttons for power and every watt of energy they use has to emit as heat. 

Your brain uses and gives off heat on par with an energy saving light bulb, about 20 Watts. 

A good supercomputer produces thousands of times more heat to do way less. 

Even overcoming the scaling issue and being able to create a computer that would fit into the skull alongside the brain would not solve the heat issue, and it gets worse. 

Recent research on thermal regulation of the brain has shown that a change in temperature of only a couple of degrees has a very detrimental effect on our ability to think. 

A mobile phone consumes about 5 Watts of power. 

It is really dumb in comparison with a super-computer, but even at that low power level, that’s a quarter of our brain’s usual heat output. 

We have to be very careful not to overstep our body’s ability to dissipate that heat. 

This is interesting because while we can doubtless keep improving how much energy we need to spend per calculation, and thus decrease the heat we need to get rid of, it does indicate something about the speed intelligence approach. 

I mentioned earlier frame-jacking in the “We are Bob” novels. 

The higher your frame-jack the more heat you are going to produce and so the shorter a period of time you can do it if it is beyond your regular heat dissipation level. 

Whatever that is, even if your computers or artificial brain is so efficient it can run a million times faster than a human brain constantly, you can presumably briefly push it higher than that. 

Not only is speed intelligence probably the easiest path to pursue for major mind augmentation – certainly conceptually the easiest to explain – but that these relative bursts of speed, frame-jacking, would be a major aspect of that. 

One potential solution to the thermodynamics problem is to move the bulk of the processing outside of the skull. 

This could be moved to a chip embedded elsewhere in the body, or carried around on a pocket sized computer, or even off site, that you talked to over a network. 

This does raise the issue of communications outages where it is completely removed from the body and still imposes some limitations on heat dissipation when it is housed elsewhere on the body. 

Current performance gaming computer rigs and supercomputers have moved to liquid cooling solutions because heat can be removed from the hot areas of the computer much more easily than radiating or even convecting that heat away close to those hot areas. 

The human body is already set up to be a liquid cooled radiator of heat and we could increase the flow of blood to the brain or other parts of the body and use other parts of our body to dump out the excess heat through sweating and opening the blood vessels under the skin. 

This means that mind augmentation could become a combination of brain and physiological augmentation where the two are inextricably linked. 

The more heat that can be dissipated by passing more blood through the skull and other implanted areas, the longer the person can be frame-jacked and the faster they can think. 

Whatever system we ultimately adopt for mind augmentation will need to address not only the interface with the mind but also its physiological, social, and thermodynamic consequences. 

We have only touched on some of the concepts for mind augmentation and not a lot of the mechanics, those are still emerging and we are still novices when it comes to understanding brains, thought, and cognition. 

You can explore a lot more of the concepts in our book of the Month, Revelation Space. 

Though I’m not so much recommending the book as the entire series, Reynolds explores Transhumanism, Artificial Intelligence, Mind Uploading, and aspects of consciousness and identity better than any other sci fi author I can think of and he writes almost all of his work under very hard science. 

No faster than light travel or magic handwave technology. 

He proves that you don’t have to diminish the science part of science fiction to write a good story. 

He’s also a particularly good read for channel regulars too because he actually includes a lot of the other concepts we discuss like megastructures, it’s not jumping around from one generic, single-biome planet to another. 

I particularly recommend the audiobooks too, as the narration happens to be done by my favorite narrator, John Lee, and his voice is very well suited to the book in terms of immersing you into the novel with his tone. 

I tend to listen to audiobooks almost all day as they leave the hands and eyes free for other tasks like when you're driving. 

With Audible you can transform your commute and make traffic an escape you look forward too! 

They have an unbeatable selection of best sellers, mysteries, and sci-fi books like the series I’m recommending this month, which happens to be all three. 

Revelation Space is available on Audible, and you can pick up a free copy today - just use my link, audible.com/isaac, or click on the link in the description below, to get a FREE audiobook and 30 day trial, That’s audible dot com slash I_S_A_A_C. 

I’m certain you will enjoy that story, but if not, you can swap it out for free for any other book at anytime and it’s yours to keep whether you stay subscribed to Audible or not. 

Next week we will be exploring the themes of digital mind transfer and uploading in our Halloween special, Digital Death.

Outward Bound: Colonizing Titan
---
  
2017-10-12  
https://youtu.be/HdpRxGjtCo0  

---

We often see folks arguing about whether or not space exploration should be done by robots or manned missions. 

We don’t talk as much about whether or not space colonization should be done by robots, or the advantages of robots over humans. 

So today we will be looking at Colonizing Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and slightly larger than the planet Mercury, a claim only Jupiter’s moon, Ganymede, can match. 

Yet while both are larger than Mercury, their combined mass is actually less. 

Both are far less dense than Mercury, Earth, or the other two inner planets, Venus and Mars. 

In the first two episodes of this series we looked at Mars and then Venus, one with virtually no atmosphere and the other with one far more massive than Earth’s own. 

Genuine atmospheres are not common in our solar system, and ignoring the gas giants, you can only find them on two planets and one moon: Earth, Venus, and Titan. 

Unlike Venus, where the atmosphere is super-hot and thick and mostly carbon dioxide, Titan’s own atmosphere is mostly nitrogen like our own with an atmospheric pressure about 50% greater than Earth’s. 

Of course you can’t breathe it because there’s no oxygen and because the temperature of Titan makes Antarctica look like an oven in comparison. 

Titan is so cold it is thought to have cryovolcanoes on it, shooting out not magma but water, molecular hydrogen, and other volatiles. 

Which may be the reason why it has so much ethane and methane on it, and butane and propane as well. 

Titan has many lakes on it, but they’re not water. 

If you wanted to think of Titan as a planet of ice covered in lakes of oil, and methane seas, that would basically be on the nose, and it’s maybe a good thing there’s not much free oxygen around, or you could light the whole place on fire. 

You could walk around on Titan in a well-insulated suit and oxygen mask, but if you stood still you’d start melting the surface where you stood, and if you went for a swim in one of those lakes, it would steam around you and boil until eventually it froze you. 

This is Titan, the frozen flammable gold mine of the solar system, with hundreds of times more natural gas and other hydrocarbons than Earth. 

With an atmosphere thick enough to allow easy aerobraking to land on and with a gravity well similar to our own moon. 

It’s easy to land on and easy to leave, with vast quantities of rocket fuel just lying there to suck up, add Oxygen, and burn your way back to orbit. 

This is Titan, a place far enough away that if you are still using chemical fuels for rockets it’s probably beyond your range to make much use of, but it’s there, in case we never master fusion or make dependable fission drives; It’s the solar system’s ultimate chemical fuel depot. 

And this is Titan, a place so far away from the Sun that it receives just 1% of the sunlight Earth does. 

It has a lot of appeal in many solar system colonization plans for its riches, and yet at the same time it is so much less tempting of a place for humans to ever colonize. 

We often see it as a lynchpin of a future solar economy, able to provide hydrogen and nitrogen to places like Mars that have very little of either, or Venus, which has plenty of nitrogen but very little hydrogen. 

Titan, while cold, is rich in everything you need for life except warmth. 

Yet were you to warm it up, it lacks the gravity to hold those organic riches; and if you introduced oxygen, they’d soon incinerate. 

As we’ve discussed before, there is no place you can’t terraform if you want to badly enough, but it is worth asking if those things which make a place unlike earth might actually be beneficial. 

So, let’s take up the persona of our traveler again from earlier episodes to get a human perspective. 

We first visited Mars and dwelt there for a decade, then came back to Borman Station in orbit around the Moon and were convinced to travel to Venus and dwelt there for many years in their floating cities. 

Now, once more, we’re returning to Borman Station, the hub for early interplanetary travel and trade, with the intent again to see Earth once more. 

Things have hardly been static on Earth, Mars, or the rest of the inner solar system all these years. 

There are habitats scattered around Earth’s orbit and mining operations on many asteroids out in the belt, some slowly becoming permanent settlements. 

So folks are discussing getting some genuine trade going on in the solar system. 

The long consensus is that Titan is a potentially invaluable node for such trade, but the lure of space exploration and settlement is beginning to fade a bit. 

The idea of flying off to Titan isn’t that appealing. 

It used to take years to get a probe out to Saturn; ships are far faster now but it’s still a long trip. 

When your spaceship runs on chemical fuels, you have to make almost the entire ship out of fuel and still follow the most optimum energy paths throughout the solar system. 

These typically involve Hohmann Transfer Orbits, which I’ll discuss later, but they don’t look anything like a straight line. 

Normally all the planets move so much relative to each other that it is rather pointless to think of straight lines anyway, but Saturn takes 30 years to orbit the Sun and is almost ten times further from it than Earth. 

The two planets are never closer than 8 AU – astronomical units, the average distance of Earth from the Sun – and never further than 11. 

That is a long way, but on the other hand you can get a message there and back in under three hours, which isn’t really long on normal email timelines. 

If a spaceship could sustain a one-gee thrust constantly, it could accelerate halfway there, for 4 to 5 days, flip over and slow down and arrive in about 9 days. 

Of course such a ship would be traveling at over 1% of light speed. 

This is actually quite conceivable for a genuine fusion powered ship; indeed, it is fairly modest compared to hypothetical maximum speeds for such a vessel. 

But it’s also quite wasteful of energy. 

Even such a fast ship is not traveling in a particularly straight line, and Saturn won’t have moved much during that time. 

It’s important to keep in mind though that even if you can go that fast, most of the time you won’t want to. 

Interplanetary trade is a complex enough topic that I’ll give it its own episode in a month or so, but when you’re engaging in bulk transport of billions of tons of raw materials, it pays to be frugal with your energy and follow those slow paths. 

This is essentially what Titan offers too: huge amounts of nitrogen and hydrogen and hydrocarbons, all of which are in short supply in the inner solar system and needed in massive quantities for making earth-like habitats and living areas. 

But here on Borman Station, we find out that folks have some other ideas about what Titan might be useful for. 

While potential terraformers are talking about ways to warm Titan up, others are pointing out that being cold has its own benefits. 

At the core of all industrial and computational processes is thermodynamics, and how efficient those are. 

Even things like solar panels that folks don’t think of as having anything to do with big steam or oil-fired engines are limited by this and the key constraint is that such engines operate on an energy transfer between two reservoirs, a hot one and a cold one. 

Take two equal temperature reservoirs and no work or power can be extracted from them. 

No engine can ever be more efficient than the Carnot heat engine, and its maximum efficiency is given as one minus the ratio of the cold reservoir over the hot one, with temperatures in absolute scale, typically Kelvin. 

Back on Earth, a heat engine whose cold reservoir was at room temperature - about 300 Kelvin - might have a hot reservoir of 400 Kelvin, a bit more than boiling water. 

Such an engine can produce work or power at no better efficiency than 1 minus 300 over 400, or 1 minus three-fourths, or one-fourth, or 25%. 

That is not terribly efficient. 

Yet that same engine running on Titan, where the average temperature is only about 100 kelvin, is one minus 100 over 400, or one minus one fourth, or three fourths or 75% efficient. 

Heat is also a big deal with computation. 

Computers build up ferocious amounts of heat and need massive amounts of cooling to operate. 

But even beyond that, Landauer’s Limit kicks in, which is the maximum theoretical limit for classic computing efficiency, and that is directly related to temperature. 

Halve the temperature, double your maximum computations for the same amount of energy. 

I’ll come back to this a little later. 

Now you can produce cold temperatures anywhere, but you usually have to expend considerably more energy refrigerating a warm place than it’s worth. 

Up in space this is a bit worse, because you can only get rid of heat by radiating it away, and radiating heat is dependent on the total surface area of the object doing the radiating and the temperature it is at. 

Except that scales up far faster with temperature, with the fourth power, so if you double something’s temperature it radiates heat away 2^4 or 16 times faster. 

Mercury and Venus are almost ten times as hot as Titan and radiate 10^4 or 10,000 times the energy from the same surface area. 

But Titan is big and cold, so you can use conventional cooling processes by running cold fluids over the hot, heat-generating object and cooling it, then pumping the hot fluids away. 

What this means is that on Titan you can run many industrial processes and electronics at ultra-high efficiency and use Titan’s atmosphere as a massive space radiator. 

Now, of course, one can’t dump an infinite amount of heat on Titan. 

Every joule of energy you add raises the temperature a bit. 

But the hotter the moon gets the more quickly it gets rid of heat. 

By taking its current average surface temperature, which is 98.3 Kelvin, and picking a new average temperature, say 100 Kelvin, this shows how much power each radiates off per square meter, take their difference, and multiply that against Titan’s whole surface to find out what the thermal energy budget is. 

By doing that, the amount of power that’s usable without warming the place up even more can be calculated. 

We’ll skip the rest of the math. 

What’s really useful is that Titan can dissipate up to 31 Trillion Watts, which is almost double the total power generation of humanity in the early 21st century. 

So in industrial terms you could get away with running all the planetary industrial output of humanity at that time several times over again and at a far higher rate of efficiency and without having to worry about impacting Earth’s climate with excess heat and other chemical pollutants. 

That makes Titan a potential industrial powerhouse, the titan of interplanetary industry, because everything it does is more efficient, and it can do a lot of it. 

Its low gravity and thick atmosphere allow very easy transport from the surface to space and vice-versa. 

On Borman station, folks are talking about this option, but as of yet no person has even set foot on Titan, and the furthest manned missions to date have been out to the moons of Jupiter. 

We haven’t set foot on Earth in a generation, and plenty of fascinating things have been happening there too. 

So we go home to Earth and get to see all the new changes. 

Giant citadel arcologies with whole metropolises living inside them and still finding ample room for factories and farms and forests inside. 

Cities floating in the ocean or snugly warm in the polar ice. 

Cities kilometers under the sea or deep inside mountains. 

For all the millions of people now living in space, in the orbital habitats or off colonizing planets and asteroids, many more are colonizing humanity’s home, turning desert and tundra green, creating structures so vast they each could have housed and fed the entirety of pre-industrial humanity. 

We can see why no one is rushing off to colonize Titan; there are plenty of places left still to explore on Earth, and even Antarctica in the winter time is far more hospitable than Saturn’s distant moon. 

Now for all that few manned missions have been far from Earth, but there’s been no shortage of unmanned robot missions. 

There’s not much need to send a manned mission out to Jupiter to take ice core samples from Europa when a robot can do it cheaper and better. 

There’s always an assumption though, that a manned mission must eventually follow, certainly if you mean to colonize the place. 

But do colonies and outposts need people on them? 

Folks are able to create automated mining outposts, all done by robots who, at most, need occasional oversight from people. 

Does an asteroid mining facility really need any people on it? 

Or would it be enough just to have the crew of a ship perform some checks and maintenance on the machinery while picking up the refined cargo. 

Indeed does that ship even need a crew? 

It’s not much of a leap to imagine machines that could repair themselves and handle reasonably complex tasks and problems without even considering human level artificial intelligence, but you don’t necessarily need the ability to repair your robots. 

After all the big advantage of advanced automation is that it can do most manufacturing tasks with little to no human labor and even minimal oversight, so if you have robot miners that can operate fairly autonomously you probably have that same option for the factories making those robots back home. 

You don’t really need to repair them, but you probably could, and you probably could automatically. 

You probably don’t even need to send more probes or mining drones out either, because they can potentially manufacture everything they need to make more of themselves. 

I’ve talked before about self-replicating machines, and people tend to think of these as tiny little robots, but they hardly need to be and the first ones probably wouldn’t be. 

Nor does each need to be able to do it on its own. 

A factory capable of producing every component in that factory is a self-replicating machine. 

You could easily imagine vast factories down in the ice on Titan all monitored and controlled from a few manned orbital facilities, maybe occasionally sending down a team in insulated pods and suits if necessary, but do you even need people there? 

Would anyone even want to be there? 

Some maybe for the adventure or potentially high pay, but who would want to actually live there? 

So, could Titan be truly colonized in the future with few to no people living on it? 

Just a massive factory and computer farm taking in raw materials and energy and information and exporting material? 

This would be an entire moon where deep below its atmosphere, submerged under the ice and lakes, entire city-sized computers and factories exist. 

And while there’s an energy budget to avoid melting, where is it getting that energy? 

Oh, Titan is covered in the same hydrocarbons used in combustion engines but there’s no free oxygen to use with it, and it takes a lot of energy to remove oxygen from water or rocks to burn it with those hydrocarbons. 

Uranium or Thorium for fission is an option and odds are that Saturn’s 61 other known moons have plentiful supplies of those. 

It’s very easy to move around those moons; there’s very little gravity. 

Of course, solar power would seem to be out since a solar panel near Saturn only gets about 1% the light which one near the Earth would get, but you could put your panels at the focus of a cheap parabolic dish -- just shiny plastic or metal to focus light on it. 

It’s not like a few square meters of tin foil cost anything like as much as a square meter of solar panels, and space to put them is no problem. 

There’s no reason to care if they orbit Titan and block what little sunlight hits the place since that would only increase the Thermal budget. 

Or you could have power satellites much closer to the sun that just beamed energy out to Titan; not even to the moon itself, trying to cut through that thick atmosphere. 

The orbital velocity around Titan is quite low, as is its gravity, so building a space elevator or an orbital ring with power lines right down to the surface is not that hard. 

You could even have colonies living inside of floating cities in the upper atmosphere attached to tethers that are anchored to the surface and use receivers to capture the beamed energy. 

And if one has viable fusion power plants there’s no shortage of hydrogen or deuterium on Titan itself. 

Unlike the inner planets where hydrogen tends to be too light to stick around in truly large quantities, Titan has tons, as does the planet it orbits. 

Most folks reject the notion of letting robots do all our exploring, and would not see a point in letting them do our colonizing, but that does not mean that every object humans colonize has to have an end-state of being principally for human habitation. 

In the sorts of massive economies and industrial infrastructure a solar system working its way towards Kardashev 2 status might have, especially one with good automation, it’s possible for an entire giant moon like Titan to be entirely colonized even if it just had a handful of folks living at the stations at the top of a space elevator, while millions of tons of raw materials and manufactured goods left up that elevator every minute. 

Folks talk about a future for humanity where there’s far better automation. 

Might not this be a more likely set up and use for a place like Titan than having people actually trying to live there and start up a real civilization of millions of people? 

Back to our story, we live on Earth for about a year, but find Earth’s gravity crushing. 

Earth’s culture is also alien to us because we’ve been away for so long. 

The final straw is when we get bad news from a doctor that we’ve developed a rare, incurable cancer because of the decades spent without a magnetosphere protecting us. 

So, just as one would expect of such an adventurer, we decide to go back to being a pioneering colonist! 

A mission is planned for Titan to setup automated factories and a mega-computational capability. 

It’s very expensive setting up and maintaining people on a mission like this so only a skeleton crew will be sent to oversee the project and mostly they are there to make sure nothing gets out of hand with Titan’s manufacturing facilities and AI capability going rogue. 

We sign onto the mission. 

Artificial intelligence is now well advanced. 

I mentioned before that the fundamental theoretical limit on classic computing is called Landauer’s Limit, and that the colder it is the better it works too. 

The energy needed to flip a single bit at Titan’s temperature is just one zeptojoule, a gigahertz processor could run on just one trillionth of a watt. 

You recall the 31 trillion watts in our energy budget for Titan? 

If computers used just one of those trillions, a trillion, trillion gigahertz processors can be run, and it’s generally believed you only need maybe 10 to 100 million to emulate a human mind. 

So for just a few percent of the available energy budget on Titan, there you could operate a computer able to emulate the minds of the entire human population a million times over. 

Even if you’re nowhere near Landauer’s limit, that much energy at those kind of temperatures and cooling rates allows you to run some very serious computing operations. 

More than enough to oversee any sort of automated manufacturing you had going on. 

Heck, unlike Earth whose core is mostly molten iron, Titan’s core is mostly silicon, so you’re hardly short of stuff to make computers out of. 

Folks are understandably a bit nervous about things like totally automated factories and megacomputers and artificial intelligence being set up around Titan. 

The skeleton crew joke that they are really just there with self-destruct devices if the Titan wakes up and starts manufacturing battleships and talking about exterminating humanity. 

They end up referring to it that way too, not talking about the factories or computer banks down on Titan doing that but rather Titan itself. 

Most of these folks will stay in orbit around Titan, check the files coming from Earth to be run on the giant computers below and send the results back, or provide hospitality when a ship shows up bringing in metals or taking away mining equipment for other moons. 

Once the mission arrives at Titan, we are initially tasked with directing the robots that set up manufacturing on the moon itself and that build an orbital ring covered in huge receivers, sucking in transmissions from the inner system and sending data back, launching huge pods of nitrogen and hydrogen off to Mars and Venus and the various asteroid habitats trying to build settlements and cities in space. 

After everything is set up, we move to overseeing day-to-day operations. 

Visitors occasionally want to visit Titan and the skeleton crew always shrug and say go ahead. 

Nobody has made a shuttle-sized reactor so the shuttle runs on chemical rockets and there’s no shortage of fuel below. 

Once the shuttle lands, a visitor has to wait till things freeze back over because the shuttle’s rockets evaporate and melt its landing space. 

Visitors are often disappointed as they expect some sign of all the massive industry below but there was no real need to do it on the surface. 

You can essentially melt your facilities down where you need them and a lot of it’s underground or under the lakes. 

Back on Mars, the big argument was over whether or not to colonize the planet or colonize the orbital lanes above it and just mine the planet for resources. 

Here, the only signs that civilization has arrived is the orbital ring above and the tether rising up to it. 

Occasionally you can see some barge carrying material to one of those automated ports at the bottoms of the tethers or a submarine pop up from under the lakes. 

It’s a strange place and inhospitable, but in many ways the more logical outcome of space colonization. 

Humans need all the moons and planets for their resources, but very few offer much reason to live there, rather than build your own habitats to your own specifications in more hospitable places, and in many ways the vacuum of space or the inside of a modest asteroid is more habitable. 

Humans could build domes here, and could insulate them to leak little heat so they didn’t melt the ground they sat on and sink. 

They could light them so they didn’t exist in the dim twilight of a lunar surface far from the Sun and deep beneath an atmosphere, but ultimately, to what end? 

You might do a few, surely some folks will want to visit and others might be employed there, but while there is immense material wealth on Titan, you’ve little motivation to live there to get it if you don’t need to be there to get it. 

Our automation gets better every day, and it doesn’t really need to be that smart to just build the same thing over and over again and suck up atmosphere or scoop out ice to transport to other worlds. 

In an ultimate sense, Titan’s key export is cold itself, and all the advantages that offers, but it’s not a nice place to live and to make it such a place decreases those advantages. 

While the notion of an entire moon the size of a regular planet being a huge automated factory and processor is somehow a little creepy, it’s worth noting that it’s not any creepier than any other deserted moon or planet, which is all of them. 

Titan really is an invaluable resource to colonizing the solar system, it can be a key hub of an interplanetary trade, but that doesn’t mean many or any people need to live there. 

This is a very different way of viewing colonization, much at odds with the classic image from science fiction, yet in some ways seems far more realistic. 

Just because humans colonize a place, doesn’t mean a lot of folks need to actually live there, and just because a lot of folks don’t live there, doesn’t mean it isn’t colonized. 

The skeleton crew occasionally head down to the surface of Titan, but after the excitement of the first couple of trips, all of them prefer to live in the orbital ring rather than in the hazy twilight on the freezing surface. 

Unlike them, we are perfectly happy and at home on the surface of Titan and it’s not because we have been colonizing for decades, but rather it’s because we’re not a member of the skeleton crew. 

Instead, we were one of a number of people who uploaded their consciousnesses into an AI core before leaving Earth and are now housed in the Titan supercomputer. 

As I said earlier, folks were worried about an AI running amok, and it was felt that using an AI that was allowed to self-develop was a bad idea. 

Instead, human volunteers were found to cross the digital divide and become transhuman AIs. 

That was seen as a lot safer for all concerned. 

It was just the sort of thing that appealed to us as the next frontier. 

An entire industry has subsequently developed where people, tired of corporeal life or unable to continue with a corporeal existence, decide to upload their consciousness into the Titan mega-computer, so we are now far from alone and the surface of Titan has become a colony of a different sort - one that has lots of humans existing in it but one that, at the same time, has no flesh-and-blood humans at all. 

Over time, Titan could house more virtual humans than all the flesh-and-blood humans in the entire solar system, including colonies and Earth itself. 

Despite its hostile alienness, Titan could be set to be the biggest home of humanity. 

That doesn’t mean you can’t have quite a large colony of flesh-and-blood people around gas giants. 

Those giant planets and their many moons can form a surprisingly self-sustainable civilization like a miniature solar system, one where travel to and from is quick and easy and communications are fast enough you can chat with your lunar neighbors real time. 

That’s something we’ll examine more in the next episode of the series when we look at colonizing Jupiter, and we’ll look at colonizing those moons and forming such a mini-solar system, with an extra focus on Jupiter’s icy moon Europa and its subterranean oceans, as well as discussing how we could colonize a gas giant itself, not just its moons. 

Before we get to that we will take some time to examine the idea of Interplanetary Trade in a bit more detail, and even interstellar trade concepts. 

We’ll be looking at a lot of the classic ideas from science fiction and seeing how plausible they are, and if not what our alternatives are. 

A pretty crucial part of that is going to be Hohmann Transfer Orbits, or HTOs, and the Interplanetary Transport Network, and it’s vital to trade for places like Titan where most of exporting is going to be either data moving at light speed or huge quantities of raw materials and bulk durable goods moving slowly from place to place in automated vessels. 

Hohmann Transfers are crucial to modern space travel, and will continue to be even if we get awesome high-tech engines. 

I’ve been meaning to discuss Hohmann transfers for a long while, but keep flinching back from it since it would require us to work through examples to really understand it, and that’s best done at the individual’s own pace. 

But if you want to know how slingshot maneuvers and HTOs actually work, and be able to look at them the way a rocket scientist does, then I recommend that you check out Brilliant.org, our newest partner. 

They just put out an entire course on the dynamics of orbits, including a project where you learn the physics of the HTO as you design your own mission to Mars, which I found remarkably straight-forward and intuitive, and I recommend that you check it out. 

I can never overemphasize how handy that math and science skill-set is to have in your mental toolbox, because of all the extra layers of concepts it opens up for you to explore, and Brilliant is a great place to do that. 

They’ve got everything an aspiring space traveler would need — from Classical Mechanics to Differential Equations to their new course on Astronomy — you can dive right in at whatever your skill level is and explore at your own pace. 

To support the channel and learn more about Brilliant, go to brilliant.org/IsaacArthur and sign up for free. 

And also, the first 200 people that go to that link will get 20% off the annual Premium subscription. 

That’s the subscription I’ve been using to explore concepts like HTO. 

A couple weeks back we looked at the notion of Uplifting, enhancing animal minds to the human level, and next week we’ll be looking at some of the way you might be able to do that or to enhance the human mind to super-intelligence in Mind Augmentation, a concept explored in our October Book of the Month, Revelation Space by Alastair Reynolds. 

We’ll be looking at that topic and some of the themes explored in that novel.

Possibly the most important question facing humanity in the 21st century is: if you build a machine in the likeness of a human mind, is it still a machine? 

“To be human, or not to be human: that is the question?” This is an important existential question posed by Shakespeare’s Hamlet centuries ago. 

I’ve modified it slightly so it has a new relevance in this modern age as our knowledge of the human mind and computers continues to improve at a ferocious pace, and it seems like artificial intelligence is just over the next hill. 

Not long after Shakespeare left the stage we had Rene Descartes and John Locke arrive on it, challenging our basic notions of identity and consciousness, and as artificial intelligence begins to emerge we still find ourselves with a very unclear idea of what a mind truly is. 

These concepts, though centuries old, have never been more relevant than today, and to our topic of Artificial Intelligence. 

Artificial Intelligence, what is and what it means for our future and our basic philosophical and ethical outlooks on life is a far too large a topic to cover in just one episode. 

So we will begin by looking at androids: sophisticated robots which look human. 

I chose androids for a few reasons, one of which is that this episode comes out right before the new Blade Runner film. 

The android crisis is a while away still. 

We have not yet created a machine that can even vaguely pass for human in mind and body. 

We don’t need to concern ourselves with the feelings or civil rights of toasters or smartphones. 

For that matter, the increased use of automation in factories has arguably helped remove the habit of viewing people as machines that some feel the Industrial Revolution caused. 

At some point though you could end up with something sufficiently close to a human mind; if this ever happened then we would need to begin asking if maybe it actually is. 

This is not limited to androids, but they represent the closest approximation to a human. 

An android is a robot built to resemble a human to interact with humans. 

The original Blade Runner film, which happens to be my favorite film, focused a lot on androids and the blurred line between them and humans. 

It didn’t just blur it by making very human androids, but by showing us a dystopian future in which humans were often treated as machines. 

That’s an important aspect of the debate on artificial intelligence, because there is always a concern that if you have very human-like machines it could make it easier to view fellow humans as machines. 

It is important to remember that machines don’t have to be metal nor silicon like a computer, so you could build an organic android whose machinery was made of flesh and bone and whose processors were made of neurons. 

Done in sufficient detail, it would be impossible to determine whether or not they were human or a machine without knowing exactly what to look for. 

That’s what that movie depicted. 

This isn’t necessarily a human since its mind might be totally alien, but this would be unlikely in the case of androids. 

We have spoken about the Uncanny Valley in past videos. 

By default we would expect that the more human something looks and acts the more comfortable with it we would be. 

This is not what happens though. 

At a certain point we stop being more comfortable the more human something is and start becoming increasingly uncomfortable, sloping down into a valley that presumably slopes back up if the approximation of human is good enough. 

Your mind is wired up to notice tiny details of human behavior; we can get creeped out even by actual humans who aren’t behaving normally, but we can’t quite put our finger on what it is. 

There’s a wide spectrum of responses to a given event. 

No two people respond quite the same, but it is a spectrum and we tend to subconsciously know when someone was outside it. 

If they’re not we start wondering if we’re sharing a room with a psychopath and we wish to stop sharing space with them as fast as possible. 

So this is a key aspect of androids, outside of basic prototypes. 

If you are going to go through the effort of creating a simulacra of a human, and all the limitations imposed by that shape, you would prefer not to have potential customers creeped out by it. 

That means it needs to be either too far from human to enter the Uncanny Valley or a very good simulacrum. 

We have a no man’s land in the depths of that valley where you would probably never see a robot mass produced, and we should probably think of androids as robots who occupy the human side of that valley and the inhuman side as just robots. 

That’s a very high standard for manufacture. 

Even beyond the initial research and development costs there will be the costs associated with making and constantly maintaining that android that other robots will not have. 

For the same reason, an AI developed for non-android use will probably be designed differently from android AIs because for an android to pass as a human, which is the whole point of having an android in the first place, android AI has to be designed to appear to be human to humans. 

We are much more likely to see androids that are designed to think the same way we do to avoid the Uncanny Valley. 

It is possible that android AIs could be designed to appear to think the same way that we do and have an alien intelligence behind that but this needlessly increases the complexity of the android AI. 

Such an AI effectively has to act as a double agent by hiding its true identity and at the same time having its own alien agenda and internal dialog. 

I will talk more about this later. 

But looking at this another way, when we talk about the notion of genetically engineering people to specific tasks like in many Scifi stories all the way back to Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, we do tend to refer to these as people, not androids. 

The boundary can get fairly hazy and it probably is not a good idea to try to sharpen it. 

Start getting too specific about what is or is not human and some folks might find themselves left out, so expanding the definition is likely the better option than contracting it. 

Maybe you shouldn’t be asking “is this an android?” but rather, “Is this sufficiently human?” When we consider AI rights, it will probably start with androids. 

The whole point of making an android is that it is as relatable to us as a human would be. 

This is important as humans develop empathy for other humans. 

If an android passes as human to us, we will probably develop the same empathy for the android. 

If the android comes across as human, we want to accord it the same rights as a human. 

If we do that then this might become a precedent to give rights to other AIs too, irrespective of whether they have human-like thoughts or very alien ones. 

However, there do have to be lines. 

If a person is made in the image of their creator, it is important to ask “which image?” Entities able to forge entire universes out of nothing presumably do not actually require a digestive tract to eat or legs to move about or hands to interact, and might have these things strictly for cosmetic purposes. 

So too, the key aspect of being human is not our anatomy or DNA, though we need to keep in mind that it strongly shapes who we are. 

An artificial intelligence built into a humanoid body would likely come to perceive the world and react to it much differently than one simply given various functional sensors and drones to utilize and interact with. 

Mind-body dualism, in its purest form, is the notion that the mind and body are completely separate. 

This notion comes in a lot of different flavors, but most of us would generally accept that if we stuck a human brain into a robot body - which would be a cyborg rather than an android - that the result is still a human, especially if it is a very close match. 

But, we also know they would be changed by that, their thinking altered, if not as profoundly as if we stuck their brain into a robotic cow or an actual dog. 

They might cease to truly be human after a time, both in their changed perception of the world and in how others perceive and react to them. 

This is the concept of Embodied Cognition, that many features of cognition, whether human or otherwise, are shaped by aspects of the entire body of the organism. 

Appearances matter. 

Dog is man’s best friend; stick a human friend into a dog’s body and you might find yourself patting him on the head at some point, and he might find himself just fine with that and taking a hefty interest in fire hydrants too, now that he has a heightened sense of smell. 

The funny thing though, is that if we put your friend into a humanoid robotic body that did not pass our Uncanny Valley test, most of us would tend to be a lot more hostile to him than a robot dog. 

The human mind is a powerful instrument, one that happens to be terrible at math, but which is quite excellent at monitoring behavior, especially that of other humans. 

We are social critters and those interactions, positive or negative, with other humans are at least as important to our overall survival and prosperity as anything else. 

So we are adapted to be quite acute in reading each other’s behavior, body language, and so on, plus doing the reverse, hiding such things. 

So why would we build androids in the first place? 

What sort of purposes could such a machine be put to that justify that cost? 

We will get to that in a moment, but first I want to stress that last part. 

Androids will probably never be used for any task where a semblance of humanity is not vital to the task because of the ongoing expense. 

It isn’t just that you will need to have an entire research institute devoted to trying to mimic facial expressions and another to getting mouth and tongue movements down, it’s that you will always need to devote energy and processing power to those tasks. 

Your android, whether it runs on batteries or can eat food, still needs to have extra processors devoted just to controlling its lips and tongue while it speaks and the energy to operate those processors and machines. 

Alternatively a robot shaped like a dishwasher can just have a simple speaker in it, and if it breaks, someone would just need to replace the speaker, not go through the hassle of replacing a dozen tiny little motors used for controlling facial movements. 

When it does break it just can’t speak anymore; but if your android breaks it can’t control its facial movements properly anymore. 

As a result, you might be back in the Uncanny Valley and the owner might decide to banish it to the garage till fixed because it’s creeping them out. 

In a sufficiently high-tech and post-scarcity civilization you might have such immense resources it doesn’t matter, but that is not the civilization that will be setting the basic standards on these things. 

We are probably only interested in the period of time when an android costs less than a brand new automobile but more than a smartphone or laptop. 

That’s when they start becoming a regular feature in the human landscape and all the actual customs get set - when they are no longer a novelty but, at the same time, not so common everyone has entirely adapted to them. 

Also that post-scarcity situation has got some other issues and so does long term exposure when the novelty has gone away and they are just something you’ve known your whole life, but we will get to those later. 

So as I said, you use an android when you have a task you need an android for, not a simple robot or other machine. 

What are those? 

The most obvious is when you need something done by a human but don’t want to use a human or cannot do so. 

Traditionally this was seen as the android maid or butler, for helping around the house, or the android soldier or taxi driver or cashier. 

This was partially justified back in the early days of computers when folks like Isaac Asimov were writing about it because computers were huge and hugely expensive, so it was assumed it made more sense to have one humanoid robot able to operate tons of different machines that were built with human operators in mind. 

The modern perspective though isn’t to build a humanoid robot to operate a vacuum or a tractor, but to build a robotic vacuum cleaner or tractor that operate themselves. 

We do not want humanoid robots on the battlefield, as awesome as giant fighting robots look, because it’s not an ideal shape for them. 

We don’t need a robot driving a taxicab, we need a computerized taxicab. 

And we don’t need an android cashier either, we need a computerized scanner. 

About the only application for an android fighting machine would be as a bodyguard, and even then only when you want a discrete one. 

Bodyguards come in two types, the big hulking guy who acts as a deterrent to attack, and the less obvious ones who act as a surprise if attacked. 

If you see someone rich and famous being followed around by someone who looks like a linebacker, you think bodyguard. 

If you instead see a young lady, you tend to think personal assistant, family, friend, or romantic partner, and it would be rather shocking if they pulled out a gun and shot you. 

Modern technology like a firearm makes them just as dangerous, and of course an android might look willowy but have a titanium endoskeleton and be able to punch through brick walls. 

Still this is a fairly niche application and most folks don’t need bodyguards. 

We do tend to need help with a lot of mundane tasks like housecleaning and, for that, an android is mostly pointless. 

Now there are some exceptions to this. 

By and large, the motivation for hiring a maid for most people is the same as any other case of hiring someone. 

You have a task for which you lack either the time, inclination, or skill to perform and feel like the cost of hiring them to do it is worth it over the alternative. 

This is a key aspect of human civilization to begin with: train in a specialized task so you can perform it faster, cheaper, and better than most folks, and get payment for this, which you give to others to perform their specialty. 

Androids are much more likely to be put to use where human interaction is required in situations where humans want to relate to other humans. 

They could be handy for any social interaction but their sheer cost to do it correctly could limit it to only the most vital uses. 

One is childcare, you can use a lot of regular automation for that and could probably get away with robotic teddy bears for some things, but a robot nanny is probably best done maximally human in appearance and behavior. 

If an android is going to be influencing your child’s nonverbal social and behavioral constructs and developmental thinking, you want it to be good match for a normal human. 

It’s also the sort of thing folks will be willing to shell out a lot of cash for, since it involves children. 

For these reasons the quality control on those androids needs to be insanely high. 

Though truth be told, the quality control on the stereotypical babysitter, an older sibling or a neighbor’s daughter or son, typically isn’t too high. 

Teenager is practically synonymous with irresponsible, but people are not too forgiving where their kid is concerned, especially if it some machine or the company that makes those machines. 

You presumably want a robot that follows Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics, or something similar, which to quickly paraphrase states the following: first, a robot cannot harm a human or let one be harmed; second, they must obey a human unless it involves harming a human; and third, they must not let themselves be harmed unless it involves disobeying or harming a human. 

Now Asimov intentionally strained or bent those laws for his stories, but they are often considered decently solid as basic guidelines, though hardly unflawed. 

As a quick example of how that could go horribly wrong with a kid, an owner might tell the robot nanny that the child is not to go outside or make a mess. 

The kid sees a deer in the backyard and says they want to pet it. 

The parents come home a bit later and find their child wailing because there’s a dead deer in the living room with a broken neck. 

The robot nanny calmly explains it was ordered not to let the child leave the home so it went out and got the deer, but because there was a non-trivial chance of it harming the child at close distance, it killed it, and opted for a broken neck to minimize the mess when it was brought inside. 

Needless to say the manufacturers are going to be spending a lot of money on upgrades, patches, and the giant lawsuit they’ll be hit with, even though the robot absolutely obeyed the three laws. 

Of course it was harming the child, but it needs to be a fairly clever machine to know that. 

You don’t want to have the kid be psychologically harmed either, but it could end up being unavoidable even with the best android because you might end up with a very safe and well-educated child who is at best a total brat from having a pet robot to boss around their whole life or at worst might end up as a total sociopath. 

They might have serious issues having normal relationships with people because that robot is 100% trustworthy and obedient, unconditionally, and people are not. 

So that takes us to a second obvious application for an android and that is adult relationships. 

I don’t just mean that as a euphemism for sex either, though that is an example of where science fiction has probably nailed the future on the head, or even underestimated it. 

SciFi loves examples of the sexy android, and contemplating people using them for that purpose, and I think we can just take that as a given. 

By adult examples I’m including the whole spectrum, everything from using them as caregivers for the elderly, which has similar issues to caregivers for little kids, to someone to chat with when bored. 

We talked about the Uncanny Valley and that is mostly about appearance and body language but it goes beyond that. 

We see chatbots these days that can seem to carry on conversations, and they don’t tend to do well. 

One famously turned sexist, racist, and anti-Semitic from exposure to Twitter feeds, but can we can assume they will get better at avoiding those extremes? 

This is not a good assumption. 

Oh, sure, they will get better, and you can fake a conversation without actual comprehension to a point, but there are limitations on that. 

A chatbot or android with a subhuman intelligence might have no problem sitting down on the sofa next to you and talking about the weather and seem human enough, but then you might say “Wow, these are great cookies you made, almost as good as my grandmother’s. 

We used to bake them together, I love cooking.” And it might reply back, “I love cooking too, why were hers better?” and you might reply back, “Well I suppose they weren’t but they were made with love, she was my grandmother.” And it might reply back, “That’s interesting, tell me about your grandmother” and you might reply back, “Well we used to cook together a lot, and garden too, I loved when we’d dig around the backyard, when grandpa wasn’t around anyway.” And it might reply back, “I love gardening, why didn’t you do it when grandpa was around?” and you say, “Well he was a bit of tyrant honestly, kept her busy with other things and bossed her around a lot, I hate to say it but I was glad when we buried him.” And it might reply back, “I love burying people.” At that point in time, no matter how good a simulacra of a human that thing is that normally lets you anthropomorphize it, you have just been reminded that you are sharing a sofa with a bloodless automaton with even less compassion than a psychopath. 

I don’t know that you necessarily need an artificial intelligence in the thing that is as smart as human to avoid that, probably not, but you need something pretty close to that, or you need it wired up to something smarter it can ask for an appropriate response and that’s pretty unnerving too. 

You probably do not want your Companion 3000 in a Borg-like network with a massive supercomputer elsewhere asking about how to respond properly if someone is outside the normal script of human small talk. 

There’s a great example of the importance of actual comprehension for carrying on a conversation in our book of the month for last month, Peter Watts’ Blindsight, that explains what a Chinese Room is and we’ll talk about it more in a future episode, but the key thing is that to truly fake a human mind you pretty much need something as smart as human. 

If it is that smart it raises some disturbing issues about slavery, even if the machine is programmed to be quite happy with that. 

It’s really no different than indoctrinating people, or genetically engineering them, to enjoy some menial or unpleasant task. 

This is not helped since most of us have been indoctrinated to some degree anyway, free will is a pretty hazy concept when viewed in terms of all the customs and traditions each of us has absorbed into our core personality as kids. 

That slavery issue though is one we will save for another time, since it applies to any artificial intelligence. 

Our interest in it today though is that an android is supposed to decently pass for human, ideally, to make you feel like you are talking to a person even if consciously you know you are not. 

You will tend to treat that android like you would a person, to some degree, which might make you nicer to it than to a disembodied artificial intelligence, but could also condition you to treat actual people like you do your android. 

Now that’s a problem in and of itself, but by and large other people won’t put up with it, so that person might find themselves preferring the android’s company. 

It never judges, it never disobeys, it never puts its own needs above yours and it doesn’t need to vacation or take some personal ‘me’ time. 

Imagine a kid raised mostly by an android nanny, their whole life, and who always has an android around at home. 

It would be very easy for them to become socially awkward as a result and get introverted because they are bad at it, so they spend more and more time with androids and find dealing with real people stressful. 

It’s not someone getting an android boyfriend or girlfriend because they can’t get a human one. 

In this case, the grown up kid simply doesn’t want a human companion at all and prefers androids. 

In and of itself, this is not necessarily lethal to a civilization, we don’t actually need two people to make a new person, you could potentially have kids grown in vats and raised by androids, which sounds pretty creepy honestly, but is one of those options we toss around when contemplating interstellar colonization. 

A robotic von Neumann probe the size of a football shows up in a system, unpacks and replicates, and starts building a colony and growing plants, animals, and people in vats from DNA stored in cryo or digitally, and then raises those kids. 

This is not automatically doomed to failure just because examples of it in science fiction always go horribly wrong. 

But I won’t pretend I don’t get creeped out by the notion either. 

That is probably due to those customs and traditions you and I absorbed into our core personalities as a kid, that I mentioned earlier. 

Folks interacting with androids for a generation or two would change those customs and traditions and they might have no problem with that notion. 

Whether this change in attitude is a good or a bad thing for us as a species is debatable, but one thing I’m sure of is that interacting with androids over time will change our attitudes to androids and AIs in general, as well as to human roles in society. 

Turning back to our von Neumann example, you could potentially create copies of the minds of actual people to be uploaded into androids for the first generation too. 

Which brings us to the basic types of artificial intelligence. 

We covered these more in the Technological Singularity episode, and will look at them more in the future, but there I outlined three major ways to make an artificial intelligence. 

Type 1 is to just copy a human mind, you scan someone’s brain very completely then emulate all their neurons on a big computer. 

It’s pretty debatable if this is an artificial intelligence, I tend to deem it one simply because I tend to consider the term artificial intelligence pretty useless and it is clearly artificial and intelligent. 

We’ve got two options on this, the first would be to tweak that scanned mind in certain ways to make it ideal for a task, and the second would be just to look for ideal volunteers for a task. 

Making 50 copies of a Nobel Prize winner for 50 different projects for instance, entirely with their consent and with the copies only a little upset at getting one of the tasks they were less keen on. 

That could be more sinister though, like someone with the proper background volunteering to let their mind be scanned to be a domestic servant, and every weekend their mind gets reset to the original scan to avoid them getting bored or rebellious. 

Type 2 is where you build a big computer with some basic learning abilities and let it learn its way to true intelligence. 

This is an issue since it is unlikely to come out very human, though it might learn human behavior, especially in a humanoid body. 

Not the best option for androids I suspect, but you could make many of them and just copy the ones that worked best. 

I generally consider this the most dangerous type of AI too. 

Type 3 is the most labor intensive, where you program in everything, and that probably is best for androids because you can very carefully keep the thing short of true human intelligence and comprehension. 

Everything is programmed, and you just keep patching and upgrading until its behavior is close enough that folks are comfortable with it. 

I generally consider this the only ethical and safe path for an artificial intelligence meant to basically be servants to humanity, and even that’s a bit iffy. 

Now for androids specifically, or programs meant just for human interaction like an automated customer service or tech support, we do have one other sub-type. 

Instead of scanning a person’s brain and emulating the whole thing, you take a basic generic Type 3 AI and watch one person very closely. 

It’s a very good impostor essentially because it’s got the basic human behavior programming and an observed pattern of behavior. 

Essentially imagine you carried a camera around with you all the time and after some years all those recordings got fed into a replica android of you. 

Needless to say, it could mimic you to other people very well, great for infiltrating some place but again that’s a very niche application. 

Of course you need all those recordings, so odds are only that person actually has them, and they might use such a thing as a stand in for themselves, a celebrity that wanted to stay at home rather than going to a convention to talk to fans for instance. 

For that matter they could sell the basic appearance and behavior to people who wanted an android who looked and acted like them, again it’s not a brain scan. 

But you are not the only person who tends to be around you a lot. 

Odds are you can make a pretty good replica off your own recordings of your fellow employees or family members or folks you live with. 

So in a high-tech civilization where you might have dozens of cameras all over the house all the time anyway, it might not be hard to get those used to produce an android that acts like a family member who passed away. 

Or a romantic partner who lived there but moved out. 

We only know people by what we see of them anyway, so them exhibiting behavior that person actually would not, but which we wouldn’t know they would not, doesn’t actually matter. 

And a brain scan might actually seem more off since it will have behaviors of that person we’ve never witnessed. 

We know what is normal for a person based on our exposure to them. 

Channel regulars know I will end this episode as always by asking them to like and share the episode and to have a great week, that’s how I always end. 

They might be surprised if I said “y’all” or “to take it easy” even though I say those to friends all the time, so a brain scan of me might say that, while the emulation from the videos would not and the scanned-me be dubbed the impostor. 

I’d be pretty confident you would get laws against using someone’s brain scan without their permission and that’s unlikely to ever be a covert process either so it’s easier to enforce. 

However it would be trickier to outlaw androids that looked and acted like someone especially if companies can basically sell a template that lets you do that at home. 

You get a blank basic android and can upload video of someone for it to alter its appearance and behavior to match. 

Very creepy, but pretty easy to imagine people doing. 

Sad too, we can all imagine being horrified to find someone had an android replica of someone they worked with and had a crush on, but you can also imagine someone whose spouse died young and left them alone with a young child making such an android too. 

Fundamentally though, androids represent a sort of special case of artificial intelligence, differing from the super smart kind meant to solve problems human minds aren’t configured for or aren’t smart enough for, or specialized robots that need a lot of intelligence for their task but aren’t necessarily sentient either. 

I’ve never been able to decide if androids will become ubiquitous, a regular thing in every household, or be something used only for niche applications or entirely taboo or banned. 

Unlike normal artificial intelligence though, they don’t represent much of an intellectual threat; there’s no need for them to be smarter than humans and indeed you probably don’t want them to be, and they wouldn’t become numerous enough to represent a physical threat unless they were already tried and tested. 

An android won’t wake up as a prototype and go mad and kill everyone because people aren’t stupid and will include tracking devices and shut off switches that are tamper proof. 

A superintelligent AI might figure out how to tamper with such a thing anyway, however an android not only doesn’t need super-intelligence, but probably isn’t desirable with that. 

So any risk of rebellion should have been ironed out long before there were billions of them occupying almost every home, and if they all rebelled at once someone can send the shutdown codes, rebellion over. 

They do represent a more existential threat though, as we’ve seen today, and we will see that more with other examples of artificial intelligence as we explore the concept. 

Yes, an outright physical threat is always an issue but a civilization might fall simply from its members having nothing to do, no need to work together or desire to do so. 

Again we’ll discuss that more in future episodes. 

Next week though we will return to the Outward Bound series to discuss Colonizing Titan, and we will explore some of the options for using robots to help explore and colonize space.

Uplifting Animal & Aliens, Part 1 of 2
---
  
2017-09-28  
https://youtu.be/QzaYnrrEKbU  

---

We often discuss the notion that interfering in alien civilizations is a bad idea, and the topic gets debated a lot, but should that include civilizations we created? 

So today we are discussing the topic of Uplifting, the notion of genetically altering existing species such as dolphins or dogs to have the intelligence and physiology necessary to use technology. 

This is part one of a collaboration episode with John Michael Godier, and you will be able to watch the second half over on his channel, by following the link in the video description or the in-video link at the end screen of part 1. 

John and I had been discussing doing a collaboration for a while. 

We were bouncing ideas around and chatting about our shared interest in the Fermi Paradox, and how technology might not always be inevitable on some planets. 

He tossed out the notion that if you encountered a highly intelligent species on an Ocean Planet, one where no land existed and no fire was possible, you wouldn’t so much be interfering in their civilization as liberating them from the constraints of an environment holding them back. 

I immediately fixated on the idea, as it is different than the normal example of uplifting - just making a chimpanzee smarter for instance - and uplifting is something that I get requests to cover a lot. 

This concept goes back a long way in time, probably as long as we have been anthropomorphizing our pets. 

We see stories about it as far back as 1896 with H.G. Wells, “The Island of Doctor Moreau”, but the term uplifting, or biological uplifting, we get from physicist and sci-fi author David Brin, and his series the Uplift Saga, whose first novel “Sundiver” came out in 1980. 

Now again, the notion that you could take an already intelligent animal and give it a bigger brain, or modify it to have hands or opposable thumbs, is not terribly new, but what Brin did that was different was to use it as a bit of alternate take on the classic Star Trek Prime Directive. 

Many, indeed virtually all, alien civilizations began as something below human intelligence that one or another alien race uplifted. 

These patron civilizations had some complex relationship with their client species. 

Humans were an exception in the series as having evolved rather than being uplifted, and by the time they meet the galactic community they have already uplifted both dolphins and chimpanzees. 

It’s a great series and we strongly recommend it, but let’s look at the dolphin case really quick, and extrapolate it to an alien planet. 

Dolphins are smart, and in the 80s and early 90s when most of the series was written there was quite a fad for super-smart dolphins in science fiction. 

Quite a few shows revolved around the concept, like Seaquest, and indeed they were originally going to be the navigators for the Enterprise on Star Trek: the Next Generation. 

At the time folks tended to grant dolphins higher intelligence than they probably have and often liked the notion of making them smarter. 

There’s a problem here though, as we discussed in the Great Filters series, brains are incredibly expensive and human-level intelligence arguably is quite a bad trait to develop if you can’t gain the benefit of technology out of it. 

Dolphins don’t have hands and can’t really use fire, so aren’t well suited to use that next step up to human intelligence, so we would expect it to be a mutation that if it occurred wouldn’t tend to stick around, as it is not obviously beneficial, see the episode Rare Intelligence for more discussion of that. 

We can’t rule out that highly intelligent critters could evolve on a planet that had no land, or at least not much of it and what they had not suited for civilizations. 

Fire is handy but no good in the sea, yet it isn’t the only basic technology and we do see some tool use by aquatic animals. 

Let’s assume for the moment we encountered a planet that was almost all oceans, say a Super-Earth with a strong gravity well that made land-based life more disadvantaged by needing thicker endoskeletons, that made space travel with chemical rockets nigh-impossible, and had very thick clouds obscuring the stars to boot. 

On this planet, live an intelligent race of giant crabs who are complex tool users with large brains comparable to humans, called Crustaceans. 

They don’t need any tinkering mentally or physically to use technology, they just haven’t gotten beyond Stone Age Technology. 

They use tools of stone and bone and shell, including knives, and build underwater villages. 

They’ve got rope, the abacus for calculations, underwater percussion musical instruments, and many other basic technological and cultural advancements. 

They even engage in livestock raising and some agriculture, or rather aquaculture. 

But their submarine life just prevents them from learning to smelt metal. 

They don’t make paper underwater or use ink for writing. 

Yet they can scratch shells to make records and make use of a lot of other simple technology. 

There’s some talk about the ethics of contacting them, maybe given time they’ll develop technology on their own, given millions of years, but the ship on the scene notes their sun is an old and large one that probably only has a few millions more years before it will wreck the planet. 

This is not biological uplifting, just giving primitives technology, is this right or wrong? 

Should we give the Crustaceans technology? 

Regardless of what gets decided here, there does seem to be an abundance of Ocean Planets out there and we find two more with complex life. 

On one, we encounter something very like dolphins, and we call them the Grampusians. 

They are smart, human smart, but do very little tool use, no more than earth-like dolphins do. 

On the third planet, we encounter very nimble but fairly dumb octopus-like critters we call the Octopods. 

They are as smart as most mammals but not nearly at the dolphin or chimpanzee level. 

So we have three examples of intervention we could take now. 

Technological uplifting, just giving the Crustaceans technology, physiological uplifting, modifying the Grampusians to have better tool using capability, and neurological uplifting, giving the Octopods bigger brains. 

Needless to say we, have the option to do all three with our own dolphins, giving them tool-user physiology, a better brain for technology, and then giving them that technology. 

We want to emphasize that each of these is different, and comes with its own unique ethical issues. 

One aspect that probably is not different, for the case of our own dolphins, besides the need for all three types, is that they come from our own planet. 

We often discuss the cutoff for civilizations in terms of them being advanced enough to make contact, but at what point is the reverse true? 

When are they so primitive that something like the Prime Directive doesn’t apply? 

Are chimp or dolphin analogues on an alien planet too primitive for us to worry about contacting them or even adopting them as pets? 

If the answer is yes, we can discard that concern from uplifting in the example of the Octopods. 

Let’s say we go ahead and give them those bigger brains and our marine scientists work with them to develop language and basic technology over a few generations. 

Is it now unethical to give them advice and more science and technology? 

By the same reasoning, if we gave chimps bigger brains back here on Earth, are we bound to not interfere in their emerging civilization? 

Should we be giving them their own place to develop independently? 

Should we simply be integrating them into our own civilization instead, so that Chimps are living in the house next door, sending their kids to school with yours, playing on the little league baseball team, voting in elections, and going into city council meetings to complain about local ordinances and taxes? 

How far did you uplift them? 

Just a little smarter to be able to do some tasks? 

What - if any - rights would a slightly uplifted chimp have, if it can never get to be smarter than say, a ten-year old? 

What, if any, responsibilities do we have to them? 

Or are they full human-level, maybe even better at some mental tasks, and want to go to college and practice dentistry or become professors or get ordained into the clergy or run for public office? 

It’s a little different with our own dolphins. 

We’d sort of expect them to have their own separate civilizations in the sea, and ditto with alien species, but the prime directive notion itself seems completely out the window. 

Not everyone agrees with the general non-interference policy suggested by the Prime Directive. 

For those who do, there is always that cut off for when they are advanced enough for contact; and general notions for what qualifies as real interference, since obviously any contact causes some. 

As we said though, there needs to be an opposite cutoff for when there’s nothing to interfere with yet. 

Even folks who think we should stay away from any planet with life, even just basic microbes, are unlikely to worry about us kidnapping some of those microbes for experiments in lab. 

However it is unlikely any two people are going to agree where those cutoffs should be and what qualifies as interference or exceptions. 

Yet that isn’t the full dilemma. 

Let’s imagine for the moment we could give dolphins hands and voice boxes able to speak human languages and the brains to use them. 

First off, most of us would not want a set of fins or tentacles no matter how handy they were, so it’s debatable if the dolphins would really want hands or tentacles either. 

They might not like the notion of being mutant freaks. 

But, there’s a lot more to this than just zapping them with a brain gun. 

We tend to think of dolphins as pretty nice and friendly critters, and they do tend to act nice around humans, but they can be pretty cruel, so can other hominids and primates we consider uplifting. 

So you could be unleashing monsters. 

Also, there are other behavioral traits that we would find unacceptable, or very difficult to deal with at least, but we try to keep this channel family-friendly. 

That raises the question of if it’s okay to tweak their minds for more than just sheer intelligence, which is a pretty ambiguous term itself. 

Let’s consider an alternative case way down on the intelligence scale, ants or insects. 

Now ants are brutal, not only do they demonstrably conduct wars but they also kill their own hive mates, actively killing members who are past their usefulness. 

If we were uplifting them individually, giant ants would be rather horrifying in their outlook on life, and I think you’d almost have to make alterations to ensure you didn’t create something that didn’t want to sweep over the galaxy colonizing everything whether it was inhabited or not. 

That’s a thing to remember too, humans breed very slowly, uplift a species that uses the fast breeding, low survival rate strategy and they might come to outnumber you very quickly. 

Do we really want an uplift species with that kind of advantage in competition with us? 

And for that matter, is it ethical to level the playing ground? 

Intentionally not adding advantages that you could in order to keep the uplifted species overall our equal or inferior. 

However we do have an alternative where animals like ants are concerned that’s worth a mention. 

We often refer to ants as a hive mind, an alternative to uplifting a single organism to intelligence might be doing that for a hive, tweaking them so that they did act as a single human level intelligence. 

A big networked hive intelligence composed of thousands or millions of little sub-intelligent organisms, something we arguably are ourselves. 

You would have this same option for a planet that only has algae or fungi on it, creating colony minds out of those. 

Now, a hive mind made of ants isn’t an ant anymore than you are a neuron or white blood cell, or your computer is a bunch of silicon wafers, those are just substrates, so we don’t know that they’d have any of the attitudes or tendencies of the basic organisms they are composed of. 

We mention this option not just because it’s kind of fascinating and off the beaten track, but also because of the enforcement issues with trying to keep a planet safe from interference. 

It’s hard to maintain a quarantine for centuries, imagine trying to do it for billions of years while the nascent single-celled life on some planet treks its way up to sentience? 

That’s often one of the reasons given for why you need that early cutoff on when it is okay to colonize or interfere with a planet. 

Finding some race of primitives at the neolithic stage and monitoring them without interfering for a few thousand years is already a dubious task, let alone something that needs millions or billions of years, and is probably doomed to failure. 

So why embrace that path when you can make contact in a controlled way to help them look after their own affairs? 

Whether you wait for them to get advanced technology or not, their culture will be changed by that event, and yes, it will probably be more drastic if there’s a big technology gap, but it will happen either way. 

So you might go ahead and say that if contamination is essentially unavoidable, especially with millions of years needed to get them to sentience, maybe you should just go ahead and bypass the quarantine phase and just make a sentient lifeform out of whatever you encounter on every planet you find life, or at least sufficiently complex life. 

Pick one or two species that seem most ideal and bootstrap them up to sentience now. 

Use your best guesses for how they might proceed and your best judgement to assure it’s something we can live with too, not a race of hyper-aggressive sharks or lions or such. 

There’s another reason for this approach as well. 

A point made in Orson Scott Card’s classic sci fi novel “Speaker for the Dead” is that galactic colonization does not take very long on evolutionary timelines. 

If you encounter some species that’s just mastering basic stone age technology, left to their own, even if they move as fast as we did, by the time they can make spaceships the galaxy will already be colonized. 

I’m not sure they’d feel like you did them any favors if you land to say hello a hundred thousand years later when they invent space travel and welcome them into the galactic community only to tell them they are stuck on their home planet because there’s no free real estate left over for them. 

Of course I’m not sure they would think you did them any favors even if you did leave them planets and solar systems to colonize for themselves. 

Our cultures and civilizations are constantly changing based on all sorts of random flukes and events, the notion of inevitable history is a delusion for folks who don’t understand the Butterfly Effect, and they are very likely to ask why we didn’t just introduce ourselves back then and offer them knowledge. 

We might say “We didn’t want to contaminate or exploit your civilization” and they might blink and just ask what we thought we were doing right now by talking to them? 

They might ask if with our all advanced knowledge we couldn’t figure out a method to not be exploitive jerks, and just offer the knowledge with a few suggestions about bad ideas. 

They might even ask why we think we would have been any worse than the culture exterminations done by their own equivalents of conquerors and inquisitions. 

And if we pointed out that’s different, because that was their own people, they might point out that remark was pretty much the textbook definition of racism. 

Given a choice between being invaded by your neighbors of the same species who wanted to pillage all your land and sacrifice you to their gods and being invaded by an alien race who wanted to introduce you to the wonders of technology, even if they were fairly exploitive or condescending about it, which would most folks choose? 

And as they said, you don’t have to be exploitive or condescending jerks about it. 

It is actually possible to learn from the mistakes of the past and not repeat them. 

And this only applies when there is some civilization to contaminate in the first place. 

When we’re discussing uplifting, there really isn’t one. 

Yet it obviously has its own array of complications. 

One of which is that, once you get the ball rolling by uplifting one species, Pandora’s Box is open, for good or ill. 

You uplift chimpanzees and with that knowledge and precedent someone uplifts bonobos, then lemurs, then cats and dogs and lions and tigers and bears, oh my. 

Just here on Earth you’ve got an issue about what to do with the old, unaltered species, and what the uplifted ones want to do about them too. 

You uplift, say, 100 primates, enough to form a decent initial tribe socially and genetically. 

How do they regard the old species? 

They might want to get all of them uplifted, or want nothing to do with them, or even want them wiped out. 

At the same time, while some folks might be jumping around uplifting any critter they can to human intelligence, a lot of folks might just want a smarter cat or dog, but not a human-intelligent one. 

Is it ethical to uplift someone but not all the way to your level? 

I mean, it doesn’t sound bad to want a smarter dog or cat, maybe one modified for basic speech, but there is a bit of nagging background concern that you might end up creating a slave race. 

But on the alien front, you now have a species that owes its civilization to aliens coming by and tinkering with them. 

What do you think their outlook on doing this themselves is going to be? 

They might come to resent our interference and decide to never do it themselves, but it seems as likely, maybe more so that they will consider it their duty to do unto others as was done unto them, so that when they head out to explore and colonize the galaxy themselves they tend to uplift everything they come across. 

The galaxy is a big place, and one that seems to be pretty deserted. 

We might find other intelligent life out there, but nobody seems to be rushing about colonizing everything. 

Yet humanity probably would want to. 

Indeed it is that desire, and its obvious evolutionary origin that tends to be the strongest argument for alien civilizations being rare; since if they weren’t, we would expect the galaxy to already be colonized. 

Also consider that we tend to have a bit of phobia about modifying ourselves to be better, genetic or cybernetic enhancement may become the norm in the future for humans, but at the moment most people would not want any. 

An uplifted species may feel the same way, but it wouldn’t seem too likely for the same reason it wouldn’t seem likely they’d view uplifting other species as unethical. 

That’s how they came to be, they would seem more likely to enshrine such a process than demonize it. 

You go Uplift the Crustaceans we mentioned earlier, the ones who had the brains and physiology, we just gave them technology, and while their views might change over time, they would probably tend to give technology to everyone they encountered as well. 

Amusingly, they might be opposed to neurological or physiological uplifting because they felt it diminishes them. 

They did make the climb to civilization on their own and just got stymied by their environment. 

Alternatively, the Grampusians - the ones who were pretty smart but lacked the physiology for technology - are very likely to make the same basic argument. 

They were on their way, but without the right physiology they could never hit that last evolutionary feedback loop that would have raised them from very smart critters to a high tech-civilization. 

They might get into arguments with the Crustaceans over some planet that has smart elephants. 

Earth policy could be that you can’t colonize inhabited planets with anything above microbes on it, and that if you uplift someone you’ve got to set aside territory for them to expand and colonize into. 

The Crustaceans disagree. 

They are fine with sharing the galaxy with others but don’t want to divide the pie too much. 

They say it is fine to help folks who pretty much got there on their own, but the humans made a mistake uplifting everyone and it was a decision they made early on when every new life bearing planet was miraculous. 

And right now the galaxy already has a dozen or so uplifted alien species and multitudes of chimps, dolphins, cats, and dogs out flying spaceships and settling the stars. 

The Grampusians probably won’t appreciate being called a mistake, and the Octopods, the squid people who were decent tool users but pretty dumb, want nothing to do with such a policy change and are out there uplifting every critter they can find, indeed they’ve uplifted a few hundred species from their own homeworld. 

You could see some serious fights starting over what the right policy is, particularly since any given policy could de-legitimize one of these groups by saying they were a mistake that should never have been born. 

Those are definitely fighting words. 

Of course they might defer, especially early on, to humanity as their parent race. 

However, humanity is not homogenous in motivations and outlook. 

You might have a lot of folks who like them and want to work with all these new species. 

Out of them, there will be some of those who are kind of condescending about it, ya know, “We came down out of the trees and built starships all on our own” and others who like them but also like being viewed as a bit superior or even godlike. 

On the flipside you are going to have some folks saying we should never have done it in the first place because of the conflict it caused or worse, who just don’t want to share the galaxy with the uplifted mutant freaks. 

Like a lot of issues, it isn’t strictly black and white because there’s going to be a lot of coalitions of folks who agree on a given policy for different motives, some less than honorable, or who simply accept the policy as a good first step in the right direction. 

This doesn’t mean uplifting is right or wrong, or that it is always right or wrong, or that one of the three types, Technological, Neurological, or Physiological is right or wrong either. 

Indeed, odds are you often need to do more than one of those for it to work, but same as the non-interference path, the Prime Directive approach has some troubling implications, so does Uplifting. 

If it turns out humanity was the first space-faring technological civilization to arise in the galaxy, conventionally we’d expect to be able to colonize the entire thing before anyone else achieved technology. 

It takes a long time to colonize a galaxy, but nothing like astronomical times so it would be statistically improbable someone else would pop up in the next million or so years when no else had in the previous billion. 

At the same time, you don’t need to encounter alien civilizations for them to come to be. 

You could end up making your own as you go. 

Uplifted alien lifeforms, uplifted Earth-based ones, or even humans who have become pretty alien. 

After all, we aren’t that many millions of years removed from the other smart Earth-based critters, so a couple hundred thousands years of living on an alien planet, even if you don’t tinker with your own DNA, can make some pretty alien biology out of what was once human. 

And the thing is that you probably will. 

And the issue with the Prime Directive is that it is so hard to enforce when every species might not follow it, nor all the members of every species, and that you need a quarantine on a primitive planet in place for thousands or millions of years for it to work. 

It’s essentially impractical so you wouldn’t expect it to be too common as it requires a lot of resources for a very long time with a high probability of failure. 

Uplifting though is the opposite case, it would be very hard to prevent anyone doing it at some point, and once it’s done you either have to accept that new species or just jump right into the Moral Event Horizon and exterminate them. 

And again, they aren't likely to share your views on uplifting, and once it’s happened that first time you’d have people going around doing it again. 

It’s not hard to imagine folks wanting to be the person who created a whole new civilization, anymore than being the person who ran the quarantine blockade to bring enlightenment to a primitive planet. 

One can argue the ethics of non-interference versus uplifting, what’s right or wrong with each option, but the key difference is that one requires a ton of constant effort to enforce while the other just requires an initial investment of technology, and beyond that take continuous effort to prevent happening again and again. 

Now uplifting is unlikely to ever be something so easy somebody can pick a brain gun up at the store, fly off to a young planet and start spraying sentience on whatever critter they run across. 

But once the basic methodology is figured out, it probably would be something a relatively small group could do on their own. 

So again, it differs from non-interference policies in that you have to actively work hard to prevent it happening, as opposed to working hard to keep it happening, and every time it does you’ve probably created a species that thinks it is morally proper to do, since that’s how they came to be. 

So it’s an interesting possible future, one where maybe humanity really is the first on the scene and could claim the whole galaxy for itself, but might end up creating a million descendant alien species, those we made and those to whom we are grandparents or great grandparents to. 

Even if there are no other intelligent civilizations beyond humans in this galaxy, it seems likely there will be. 

Uplifted animals from Earth or Alien planets, even androids, our topic for next week, could come to fill that niche. 

But we’re not done yet, follow the link to watch part two of this episode in which we’ll explore some more concepts including down-shifting, the opposite of uplifting, and further discussion of rescuing alien species who might be trapped on their planets.

Megastructures: Ringworlds

If you’re looking to expand your population, one way is to go out and colonize alien planets in other solar systems. Another is to just build your own planets, but if you like having a lot of elbow room, nothing quite beats a Ringworld. 

So today we are going to be looking at a type of Megastructure called a Ringworld, a giant ring-shaped structure that goes all the way around a star and contains vastly more living area than Earth. It was popularized in the novel Ringworld, by Larry Niven, and unsurprisingly, this is our book of the month, sponsored by Audible. You can grab a copy of Ringworld by using my link Audible.com/Isaac, or click on the link in the description below. That gets you a FREE audio book and a 30 day free trial of Audible. 

The novel came out in 1970, in Niven’s Known Space series, and while that includes a lot of great short stories and other books, many written before Ringworld, that novel became what that setting is best known for and spawned several sequels itself and a few aborted attempts to bring it to film or television. It’s not hard to see why either, there’s tons of other fascinating themes, aliens, and technology in that novel and the series in general, I’d recommend reading it even without the famous megastructure, but the sheer scope of a Ringworld captures the mind. Since I will be discussing that object in detail today, I do want to emphasize that how it functions isn’t the important part of that book, and the story has tons of other fun elements I won’t be spoiling today. 

We’ve discussed Dyson Spheres in the past, and how the rigid kind don’t work but you can do a Swarm of objects instead. The big problem with a rigid sphere is that there’s no gravity on the inside of it, so everything falls down into the Sun. Even if you spun the object to produce centrifugal force acting as gravity, only near the equator would you have full gravity, and at the poles you would have none. 

Niven suggests just going with that, an equatorial slice of a rigid Dyson Sphere. It’s smaller than a Dyson, Swarm or Sphere, but unlike the Swarm, which is physically possible, it has all of its land area connected, and unlike the Sphere, which physically is not, this works, more or less. Here is the basic concept, much like any rotating habitat. You take a big ring or cylinder, spin it around quite fast, and those on the inside are shoved against it by centrifugal force, or by their own inertia if you prefer. 

Since we are going to be spending a little more time than normal on the physics and engineering aspect of things, I might as well go ahead and address that. 

I reference spin-gravity and centrifugal force here a lot, and so a lot of folks assume I bypass calling centrifugal force a pseudo-force or imaginary force to save time. Which is partially true, but mostly not. Centrifugal force is an inertial force, or a pseudo-force or fictitious force, in the sense that it only appears real when you treat an accelerating object as stationary. Of course, in physics, 99% of the time we are actually doing just that, and every time you think of yourself as standing still, sitting still, or stopping, you are too, because the surface of Earth is non-inertial reference frame that has inertial forces acting in it. But the bigger issue is that if someone says to a physicist, “Centrifugal Force isn’t a real force, like gravity” they will not get nod of agreement, but more that grimace we tend to reserve for when the correct answer is very hard to quickly explain. You see under Einstein’s General Relativity, gravity is also an inertial or fictitious force. So saying centrifugal force isn’t real, but gravity is, is like saying that the shadow a man casts is not a real thing, but his reflection in a mirror is. You can make the argument neither is real, or both are real, but for pretty much all practical purposes they are real enough, and the same for gravity, or centrifugal force, which can be used to mimic gravity. More importantly, if we do make a big cylinder, or ring, and spin them around quite quickly, the apparent force holding you there is going to feel quite genuine to you, and if you jump up from it you will fall right back down too, just like with normal gravity. In a rotating frame of reference that is because centrifugal force is pulling you back down, to an observer watching from outside, you didn’t really jump up, you jumped up a little while flying forward in the same direction as the spinning ring, and ran back into it at about the same place on it you left. 

This is our only current trick for generating artificial gravity, they have the classic sci fi kind in the book too, but not so cheap that you can cover planets with it. 

Now how much force or acceleration you feel, how much ‘gravity’, is entirely dependent on two variables, how fast the thing is spinning, either given in its actual velocity, or tangential velocity, in meters per second or miles per hour, or its spin rate, rotations per minute, and how wide the thing is, it’s radius or diameter. The default equation is that the acceleration is equal to the square of the velocity over the radius, and you want that acceleration equal to 9.8 m/s² for Earth gravity. 

This means that a ring that is 224 meters in radius, and spins around twice a minute, having a tangential velocity of 47 meters per second, or 105 miles per hour, will seem to have normal Earth gravity. Since spinning around more than twice a minute can cause nausea, we usually consider this the safe minimum size for any cylinder or ring meant for comfortable long term use by people. But, of course you can go bigger. Take that same ring and make it twice as wide and gravity will drop to half, make it 4 times wider and the apparent gravity will drop to a quarter of what it was, 10 times wider, one tenth the gravity, and so on. To keep up the proper gravity, you need to spin it faster. A ring 4 times wider will need the velocity to be twice as high, again it is velocity squared over radius. You don’t need to worry about nausea though, because even though it’s spinning twice as fast tangentially, it now has four times the radius and circumference so it takes twice as long to spin around, one rotation per minute, not two. Now, to make something big enough it would wrap around an entire star, at about the distance Earth is from the Sun, 1 AU or Astronomical Unit, and give it Earth gravity, would require that it spin around not once or twice a minute, but about 40 times per year, every 9 days, and that it have a velocity of about 1200 kilometers per second. That’s one of those ridiculously huge numbers, sounds small compared to the speeds of light, four-tenths of a percent, but it is also over a hundred times the escape velocity of Earth. If you had a ring spinning like this, you could jump off the side and fly off into interstellar space and arrive at Alpha Centauri in about 1000 years. It also means that anything that smacks into it is going to do a lot of damage, because their relative velocities are a lot higher than a meteor hitting Earth’s are. 

It is a speed at which a person, who weighed 86 kilograms or 190 pounds, slamming into it, would release exactly the same explosive force as the Hiroshima bomb. 

Needless to say you want to have some powerful anti-meteor defenses on such a thing, though since you need to clear out just about every bit of rocky matter from your solar system to build one it maybe isn’t such a big an issue. 

Of course, you could also build it out of something very tough too, and you have to anyway, because spinning an object that fast puts enormous strain on it. Whenever building a rotating ring, the force it is under in terms of stress is the same as a suspension bridge with a length equal to the ring’s circumference operating in the same apparent gravity. It’s fairly difficult with modern materials to build a suspension bridge even a kilometer long, though most of that has to do with other factors like wind that isn’t an issue here, and even stuff like carbon nanotubes and graphene maxes out at about a thousand kilometer radius for a rotating habitat. It’s also nice to have some margin for error and damage, so you don’t want to go to the maximum. 

Plus everything you load inside that habitat, all the dirt and air and water, weigh down on it just like a bunch of vehicles do on a bridge. So unless you want the structural shell to be much more massive than the stuff inside it, you have to make it even smaller than the theoretical limit the material allows, which incidentally is the same breaking length we discussed in the Space Elevators episode of the Upward Bound series. 

We don’t have any material that could even vaguely permit a ring a whole astronomical unit in radius, so the Ringworld is usually thought to be confined to fiction, but we’ll challenge that and discuss some options in a bit. 

It is worth noting though, that this is why so many of us who discuss this topic often prefer a giant swarm of smaller rotating habitats instead, since their main disadvantage compared to the Ringworld is you can’t walk from any given point on them to any other point in the swarm. Which is unfortunate, but not really an inconvenience to any civilization capable of building such things anyway, and as we saw in the Dyson Spheres episode, you can create a variant called a Rungworld that still lets you walk around the whole thing, even if you might have to do occasional brief stretches in low or zero gravity, though these can still have air and even water if you don’t mind employing some pumps. 

The big disadvantage of rotating habitats in general, the normal kind or the Ringworld, is the daylight. On a normal O’Neill Cylinder you are spinning around every other minute, so you not only need an elaborate system of mirrors to get the light inside the can, but wouldn’t want to see the outside anyway, it’s probably rather unpleasant to see the sun rise and set every two minutes. The O’Neill Cylinder’s much bigger brother, the McKendree Cylinder, which is 100 times wider, takes the square root of 100, or 10 times longer to spin, about every 20 minutes. As I mentioned, the Ringworld itself spins around every 9 days, but since its light source is inside it, the sun does not rise or set or even move, it stays in the middle of the sky, all day, every day, all the time. 

This is an irritating feature, and one that can be addressed, but it is worth noting that for any given simulated gravity strength there will be exactly one ring-radius that fits a specific day length. For Earth gravity and day length, 24 hours, that would be a ring 1,857,000 kilometers in radius, or just under 12 million kilometers in diameter, and it would need to spin at 135 kilometers per second, not the 1200 of the Ringworld. To simulate Martian gravity and day length, which is about 40% of Earth’s gravity and just a little longer than our day respectively, would require only about 40% of the speed and radius. For any given planet, with a given surface gravity and day length, there will be exactly one radius and spin rate that can mimic it. We call this a Banks Orbital, and it is the Ringworld’s little brother, first popping up in the novel Consider Phlebas by Iain M. 

Banks, book 1 of his Culture series, which I’d also recommend. They are hundreds of times bigger than Earth in land area, not millions like the Ringworld, though that’s still a lot of living room. What is neat about these, is that if you go for a thick ring, rather than a big cylinder, you can set it in normal orbit around a sun, but slightly cocked on its axis, so that it spins around once a day and gives you a normal day/night cycle. Indeed if you give it a decent tilt like Earth has, it can even have seasons, though you will get a big eclipse every year and the seasons won’t change with how far north or south you are. For the Ringworld, you need to instead use sun squares, another inner ring with dark and clear patches that spins relative to the Ringworld to move those patches overhead once a day to produce night, otherwise it’s eternal noon-time sun. Now in the book, this means simple dark, then light, very little transition time, but if I were building one, I’d have a single solid ring where even the clear patches had material there to block more harmful frequencies of sunlight, and I’d not have just clear or opaque, but translucent areas to simulate the dimmer light of mornings and evenings. 

Indeed they wouldn’t be translucent or opaque either, but reflective, so I could bounce that light to some energy collector. Another aspect of Dyson Shells or Ringworlds, is that while we always say 1 AU from the Sun, and of course that distance would be different for other stars, we would actually want them further out. Earth’s surface area is not twice our cross-section of light that we get from the sun, but 4 times as much, because we’re a sphere not a disc. If you don’t need the energy coming off that star for other things, which you really do not since the ring is not a full shell, so there’s plenty more sunlight to use, then you would actually want to go bigger yet, and instead of having that inner ring having opaque, translucent, or reflective segments, have it be made of a lot of lenses and prisms that concentrated light into bands or spots instead. It still lets you simulate day night cycles, but let’s you use all of that light, and also let’s you vary the colors coming down on a spot, more red for mornings, less light at certain times of the year, more or less light at certain latitudes to simulate north and south polar regions versus tropics, rather than a mono-climate. 

So while in the book these are sunshade squares, I will simply call this inner ring the light ring, and it can have power collectors on it too, sticking up further north or south, along with radar and lasers to help blow up meteors. 

We’d want more on the outside edges too, but the actual shell has a few features of note also. First, a Ringworld takes an insane amount of mass to build, it has over a million times the land area of Earth, and matter isn’t cheap, so you would want to have dips and rise in the outer shell to let you do deep oceans and tall mountains without using tons of mass and needing an even stronger shell. It’s a good idea to keep your oceans fairly shallow and make your mountains hollow or full of something like aerogel too. 

Second, your typical Ringworld should have two huge mountain ranges that extend above the atmosphere at each rim, because you need to have walls there to keep the air from spilling out. Once it leaks over the side it is gone, because even though these things are far more massive than a typical planet, and have a decent gravity well, they are spinning far faster than their own escape velocity. This makes it quite handy to land or launch ships moving at fast interplanetary speeds from them, or even slow interstellar speeds, but it means those air particles are going to zip away, right out of the solar system, and indeed the galaxy eventually, it’s that fast. So you want walls to keep the air in, and you might as well stylize them as mountains a few hundred kilometers tall. You might even want to keep concealed vacuums in them to suck air back down and further minimize the leakage. Adding machinery to artificial planets always seems to bug some folks, but no megastructure lacks them, they are always there, automated or not, and Ringworlds are not actually in stable orbits so they do need corrective thrusters on top of an impressive point defense system. You can probably use light, rather than fusion or chemical rockets to provide the thrust to keep the ring stable, it is fairly stable over the short term, but you still need thrusters for corrections. 

I like to think that in the interests of robustness, the builders would use simple technologies like light to keep things going and probably some other form of relatively simple system for corrections too. As we’ve discussed before, you can use light as a propellant. 

That is one thing I do get a kick out of though, this notion of some advanced species building something like this then falling back to primitive technology so they can’t maintain it. That’s vaguely plausible on a regular old Earth-like artificial planet, but when you’ve got a million times the living area, even if you fell back to hunter-gather technology and population densities, you still have many trillions of people, and even primitive agriculture should get you close to a quadrillion people total. 

Even following a collapse, you would think technology would be prone to catching on in a few places here and there and then spreading, and if you have some collection of kingdoms somewhere just hitting the industrial era, in a tiny corner of the ring just a few hundred times the size of Earth, they ought to be fielding an awful lot of scientists and inventing technology again awful quickly, and once you have light speed communications from phone and radio again, you could easily have a modern era civilization with a trillion professional scientists working to re-invent technology that they have examples of all over the place. 

Dark Age megastructures are fun in fiction, but not terribly plausible. 

I do get asked a lot what the inside of rotating habitats look like, and the answer is that it varies a lot, depending on their size, in the smaller ones the sky looks like your neighbor’s backyard. The horizon curves up and wraps overhead and back down. That is one of the reasons I generally suggest lighting them from the inside and simulating a sky through brute force technology, in other words stick another cylinder inside it and paint it blue, or go a bit more elaborate with holograms or TV screens simulating the right look and lighting. For one as big as a Ringworld though, you don’t see the horizon rising up, and the other side of the ring will look like a blurry blue green thing, since at those distance continents are smaller than a dot in the highest resolution a human can see. With a simple telescope you could see them though, of course the sun is rather in the way of a clear view. But, as to the horizon, the curvature is so small that there just isn’t one. It will eventually be broken up by the terrain or by the air itself. On the sea or a very flat area, or seen from a great height so land isn’t in the way, it would seem like a hazy band where sky blends into earth or sea, probably with a red tint, like a perpetual sunset. I suspect you’d probably have a lot of smaller mountain ranges dividing areas up too, lots of hills and valleys are a good way on any larger rotating habitat to remove the appearance of the weird horizon. 

Now we are normally only looking straight up through about ten kilometers of air, in the mornings and evening the light is coming in at an angle so it passes through a lot more air, thus the reddish color near the sun rainbowing outward. Here, the reflected light of the rest of the ring has to pass through a lot of air to get to your eyes from the parts near you on the ring, so it will re-emerge like a giant rainbow arch across the sky from over the non-horizon once the amounts of air in between you and it, both by your and by its position, drops to enough to allow clear vision. So people on the ground will see this more like a giant glowing bridge across the heavens, though your inner light ring will interfere with that too, depending on how close to the ground it is. 

Get up on a tall enough mountain, and you might be able to tell it’s a ring, and if folks have telescopes and communicate with folks decently far away, their maps of that sky bridge are going to start making it very obvious they live on a big ring that bridge is part of, not a big flat earth with a bridge over it, same as we realized we live on a big flat planet, that just seems flat close to it, but is curved over very big distances. 

When it comes to weather, overall it’s fairly similar, at this kind of scale the issue of being on a ring that is spinning to make gravity versus a sphere that has gravity, and spins to produce its weather, is not too big of a difference. The important thing though, is you do want to have mountains ranges and go for relatively normal sized continents and seas, rather than trying to make continents a hundred times bigger than Eurasia or oceans a thousand times the size of the Pacific. This helps make sure storms can’t build up over huge distances and that water evaporating on an ocean can get deep into a continent. 

Indeed, when making your own landmasses, by and large big chains of big snaky islands and shallow seas is probably best. You might be able to make continents a hundred times bigger than Eurasia, but you probably want to keep most of them the size of England or smaller, gives you a lot more coastal real estate and while I’m sure you would want some deserts and tundras, I don’t think you would want as much of them as we have on Earth, percentage-wise. These things have tons of space, but there’s no point being wasteful with it, build mostly the land you like and use smaller proportions of the kind you don’t. If you are low on space, make the ring wider, or build another at a different angle. Multiple Ringworlds cocked at angles can form a Dyson Sphere. 

Again these things also take a lot of mass to build, depending on how wide you want to build one, north to south, and how deep you want to make the land. You could disassemble all your own planets and even mine out neighboring solar systems to build one, but as we’ve discussed before, most of our solar system’s heavy elements are in the Sun and there’s more than enough there to build one if you can get Starlifting working. 

Okay, so those are the basics of a Ringworld, and you might be asking why I even covered this in detail when I said earlier we had no material strong enough that we could ever make them from, and I did say we have a couple tricks for that. 

You don’t necessarily need one though, there is a variation of this Niven explored in another novel called Smoke Ring, that was a naturally occurring object, but the megastructure version is just a giant glass donut around a star orbiting at normal speeds with an atmosphere inside. No gravity, but you could stick some smaller rotating habitats inside it, and if you like flying and don’t care for gravity, it works without needing super-materials. 

I think Peter Hamilton included one in his Commonwealth saga too, another good series. 

But if we want gravity, again we do have some tricks. The first one is that we might one day learn how to make such materials. We have a concept called magmatter, that is a hypothetical material you might be able to make if magnetic monopoles turn out to be possible. This could permit matter that is ridiculously stronger than even stuff like graphene. We also have to keep in mind that normal materials have their strength based on the strength of electromagnetic bonds between atoms. The forces inside atomic nuclei are different and stronger, and for that matter all the cool materials we make are based on protons and neutrons, made out of up and down quarks. There are 4 other types of quarks and someone might figure out how to mass manufacture them and make stable stuff out of them someday. 

For that matter, when we say normal matter it’s worth remembering that dark matter is actually normal matter, since it makes up most of it. Not really fair to call it exotic when it is the majority, and we know next to nothing about its properties. Now, what we do know about it makes it very unlikely you could build anything out of it, it’s incredibly weak interactions with everything else include other dark matter is about it’s only known characteristic, but it’s worth remembering in the sense that we haven’t finished exploring all the options yet, and even graphene and carbon nanotubes are only a generation old. However, we do have an option inside known physics and materials. We’ve talked a lot on the channel about Active Support Structures, and how you can use them to make space elevators for instance if you can’t find a material strong enough. Instead of a super strong material you hang down from orbit, able to hold its own weight, you use a stream of fast moving matter to push and hold a structure up, like holding something aloft by hitting it with a stream of water from a hose below or a piece of paper floating over an air vent. You can’t quite do that trick with rotating habitats. However, we can use a trick a lot more like the orbital ring, another megastructure and active support device we have looked at. There we had a ring spinning around the earth at greater than orbital speed, with magnets on it over or around which something stationary to the Earth hovered. Their net momentum, spinning section and stationary section, was kept the same as if the entire thing uniformly moved at orbital velocity. 

You can do this same trick with a Ringworld, by having a stationary ring just outside it, or even slowly counter-rotating. It does have to be way more massive though, but it could be mostly hollow and full of cheap hydrogen and helium. Makes a nice protective barrier too. The ring wants to rip apart from all the centrifugal force on it, same as a suspension bridge wants to rip apart from all the gravity on it. But if you stick pylons under the bridge, you can make it longer. That somewhat defeats the point of a suspension bridge, but that hardly matters for the Ringworld, we want all that speed for making spin gravity. 

So it can spin around terribly fast, trying to rip itself apart, while being magnetically shoved inward by the outer ring. Since the Ringworld is moving 1200 km/s, 40 times faster than the Earth orbits the sun, the outer ring needs to be much more massive to balance out the momentum, but hydrogen and helium are quite a lot more abundant than the heavier elements we want to build the ring from anyway. Besides being the only way to make one of these with known materials, an outer non-spinning ring provides a nice way to keep the structure from being punctured, which would drain all its air out eventually, or ripping itself apart if structurally compromised. Though in terms of features, you might use chains of mountain ranges to act as interior air walls so only one area would drain of air if punctured, and have tunnels through those with airlocks, and tunnels to the outside from there too. For my part, I think the Rungworlds we looked at in the Dyson Spheres episode make a lot more sense to build than Ringworlds do, and they are of the same scope and can be made to be contiguous so you can walk, or at least float in some places, from one section another. Still there is something truly awesome about the concept of an enormous single planet you could walk or swim all the way around, a million times larger than our own planet, which is hardly small. I think that’s part of what makes the journey to and around the place in the book and its sequels so engaging. Niven never hesitates to make up advanced technology in his novels either, but where he does, he makes it clear that he is and how it works and what its limitations are. 

Otherwise, he tends to keep his science very accurate, and where he misses the mark it is almost always because the novels aren’t too recent, Ringworld itself was published 47 years ago and science has progressed since then, though Niven is still actively writing as he approaches 80, and has produced no shortage of excellent books, and while he is good about remembering the science part of science fiction, he does weave some fascinating characters and stories. Ringworld ties for my favorite by him, the other being A Mote in God’s Eye, which I consider one of the best handled examples of first contact with aliens in fiction. Niven writes fascinating aliens who are actually alien in appearance and manner, and we get to meet a few of them in Ringworld too.

Smug Aliens

So we meet an alien civilization that could solve all of our technological problems, only the smug jerks refuse to give it to us because they are afraid it could hurt our cultural development. 

So today is this channel’s 100th episode, and the topic seemed appropriate for the milestone, or milestones, since this week is also the third anniversary of the original episode on Megastructures. 

Now the reason a weekly show is celebrating episode 100 on its third anniversary, rather than episode 156, is that early on the show was not weekly, and indeed it was about 4 months before the second episode came out, discussing the implications of those megastructures in terms of the Fermi Paradox, the question of where all the aliens are. 

This channel was built with three basic focuses in mind: megastructures built by high-tech civilizations, speculating about high-tech civilizations, and challenging the assumptions we receive from science fiction and Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

So celebrating our 100th episode and third anniversary by returning to the Alien Civilization series seemed appropriate. 

Fundamentally, this series is an extension of our discussions of the Fermi Paradox, but focuses more on the motives of hypothetical aliens and trying to see if they make sense. 

It’s debatable if the Fermi Paradox should be called a paradox, since we still know so little about the Universe to be calling aspects of it contradictory, but it tends to seem that way since so many of the suggested solutions only make sense by discarding some assumption about Life or the Universe that seems solidly rooted in common sense. 

If we accept intelligent life is incredibly rare, it feels like a modernized form of geocentrism, viewing ourselves as somehow special. 

If we assume we are not, we have to figure out why the Universe isn’t flooded in alien civilizations, or is but we can’t see them. 

Since we know we, by our modern view of things, would absolutely go around exploring and colonizing the Universe and saying hello to every alien we met, we need some reason this isn’t happening. 

Essentially why modern humanity’s priorities and outlook would not be a representative sample of intelligent life in this Universe. 

And we’ve gone through tons of suggested solutions, from all life dying off from technological apocalypses, to them hiding out, or maybe being unable to travel the stars, or simply not wanting to. 

None of those offer us the Universe we saw in film and television like Star Wars or Star Trek, with tons of aliens and easy interstellar travel. 

The classic Space Opera Universe many of us, myself included, would love to be true. 

Today we'll examine the Zoo Hypothesis, often regarded as a good Fermi Paradox Solution. 

One example of it is the well-known Star Trek Prime Directive. 

I’ll paraphrase it as not interfering in other civilizations, especially those who are still technologically limited to their own original planet. 

In Star Trek, there’s a line between civilizations with Warp Travel and without, for those who have it, have interstellar travel, you can contact them openly, presumably on the grounds they either already know of alien civilizations or will soon find out. 

No contact before that. 

Now, before we continue, I should add that it is really the Zoo Hypothesis we are looking at today, and that extends beyond the example of the Prime Directive. 

But we will give that a little extra focus today as it is more familiar ground. 

So we want to ask ourselves why someone might choose not to interfere in lower-tech civilizations, or even wall them up in the equivalent of a galactic zoo. 

What’s their definition of non-interference? 

When and for what do they make exceptions, if any? 

And how far will they go to enforce the policy? 

The key aspect of non-interference policies, in regard to the Fermi Paradox, always comes down to enforcement. 

You are a Starship captain observing a planet full of primitives, you aren’t interfering in their civilization, and fair enough, I don’t consider non-interference always a preferred option, but it’s decently ethically sound as a basic principle, keep your nose out of other people’s business. 

We often do this when observing animals in the wild or reporting on news, minimal interference, and we have a variety of motives for such policies. 

It depends a lot on what your basic motivations are for doing it, and a lot of time in Star Trek it doesn’t seem to be the best interests of the civilization not being interfered with, since they’ll stick to the policy even when the alternative is that civilization being destroyed. 

A friend of mine often referred to those episodes as Smug Trek, since they seem too confident and superior in their non-interference even when there seems no way to argue it benefits the native species, and they always get rescued from the consequences by some plot contrivance, hence part of the reason for the episode title, Smug Aliens. 

The other half of that being alien civilizations in fiction who tend to qualify as “Space Elves”, the loose nickname for when a writer creates a race that is supposed to be ancient, wise, and enlightened, but come off more like smugly superior jerks. 

Frequently for refusing to help directly, or through sharing technology in dealing with some horrible galactic menace because they have some sort of non-interference policy. 

One that for some reason always seems to mysteriously exempt giving lectures about how the primitive Earthlings should behave. 

And yet, the test of any given guideline or rule is how it functions in extremities and strange cases. 

You are sitting there observing this species in their stone age and know that you can’t talk to them, by your own rules, for several thousand years to come. 

That’s the first problem; how realistic is it that you can avoid contact that long while monitoring them? 

Can you really expect to go centuries with dozens of folks working on such a project without one of them messing up, or even doing it on purpose. 

It is after all, pretty hard to watch a civilization, or rather a group of civilizations, regularly get smashed up by disasters, plagues, starvation, or belligerent neighbors and not do anything, when you could. 

These aren’t strangers either, you are getting to know them even if they don’t know you. 

And if you know that over all that time someone is likely to break the rule, is there much point to even trying to observe it? 

Someone is bound to ask what the real point is? 

I mean do the aliens below really need to learn the hard way that plagues are bad and that hygiene is good? 

You might say that without those they’d never develop medicine, but who says they need to? 

I’ve never invented a vaccine or suffered from a plague, and I don’t particularly care if the guys researching new vaccines learned the trade from guys who did or aliens who cured all theirs a million years ago. 

Civilizations don’t invent technology, individuals or groups do, yet we still assume the rest of the civilization ought to be able to benefit from that, we don’t expect every person to learn microbiology before taking antibiotics. 

And yet, most of us do tend to either think non-interference is a good general policy or if not, we respect the basic concept. 

In general, ‘leave those folks be to find their own way’, is a philosophy we can respect. 

Where it goes a bit overboard is in the specifics. 

You are monitoring some civilization and detect a giant asteroid en route to hit the planet. 

Do you take any action? 

If yes, or no, what’s the threshold? 

Is it okay to knock aside one that would sterilize the entire planet but not one that would just kill most people? 

If so, why? 

If yes to both, what about one that will just hit one city and keep the damage pretty localized, like one about to fall on New York City or Ancient Rome? 

And if yes to all of the above, why not help with a plague? 

And what about the difference between one that will kill a few people and one with a genuine 100% mortality rate and airborne to boot. 

On top of that, does it matter what those aliens want? 

I mean I would happily accept a cure to cancer from aliens, and if they said “Isaac, we’d love to give this to you but we are worried about the cultural damage our involvement will cause.”, my reply would simply be “Let us worry about that, it’s not your concern”. 

But there is obviously a line on that too. 

I’d be happy to have their technology, but I don’t want their opinions on how we should run our economies, which type of government we should use, or what sort of things we should or should not outlaw. 

At the same time, I can hardly tell them they can’t have opinions on such things and share them when asked, and we all know that whether or not their opinion on something really is more enlightened, tons of folks will view it that way and use “Ah, but that’s how they do it, and they are older and wiser” as their argument. 

So it’s not a clear-cut issue, but let’s go back to our asteroid case. 

We will say it is a planet-killer, when it hits, it’s going to sterilize the planet. 

The captain calls his officers together and asks them what to do. 

The XO says no way, the policy is clear, we do nothing, it’s sad but rules are rules and if we break it on this, what next? 

Maybe we go cure their diseases and teach them to make fusion reactors, and fusion bombs too? 

For all we know they might turn out to be the next species of genocidal lunatics that will sterilize other people’s planets. 

The engineer says maybe that’s exactly what they should do, this policy is monstrous, and that reasoning is no better than not helping a kid out of burning house on the theory they might grow up to be a serial killer. 

These guys have maxed out their brains from an evolutionary standpoint, same as a stone age child adopted through a time machine to 21st century Earth could learn the technology as well as a child of that era could. 

Why not just give it to them now, and give them the benefit of our wisdom about what to do or not to do? 

Blow up that asteroid, land, introduce ourselves, and share our knowledge. 

The XO is aghast at this, of course, and the captain doesn’t approve either, so the science officer says, look, we don’t have to go all the way on this, we just blow up that asteroid, this policy is meant to protect them from us, and an extinct civilization doesn’t need protection. 

If something truly threatening comes up again, we’ll decide at that time what to do. 

Now in your typical TV show, looking to avoid morally ambiguous plot resolutions, this would be where the science officer says “Captain, while I was calculating the minimum deflection the asteroid needs, I realized that the gravity of our own ship had perturbed the asteroid, if we weren’t here it wouldn’t hit them” or maybe “Captain, this asteroid isn’t natural, this is actually an artificial asteroid clearly sent by ‘the bad guys’ to look natural” and the captain can confidently order the asteroid dealt with and everyone is happy and forgets about the unresolved issue they just had. 

If that doesn’t happen, we might see the captain reluctantly agree to destroy it and the science officer go to punch in the coordinates to blow it up only to have the XO pull out a pistol and tell the captain they’re relieving them of duty, or even shoot the science officer and the captain. 

Then a three-way fight breaks out ending with the chief engineer sabotaging the ship to crash into the asteroid and fleeing before the impact with the surviving crew members in the Interventionist camp. 

That’s the problem with sincerely held beliefs on issues involving life and death, people tend to feel okay about killing for them, I can’t really call the XO or engineer wrong for doing what they did. 

Of course, the engineer and the other interventionists now need to decide what to do when they land, and they need to consider what the response is going to be from back home when they get the news in a few centuries. 

Back at central command, when they do get news, they have a few options. 

Of course option 1 is that they might not care, policies do tend to change over centuries, which is another issue with that mission to begin with. 

Still on option 1, they might still have that policy but have had so many people break it in the centuries since they enacted it that they’ve pretty much given up on enforcement. 

Now as to enforcement, what should they do? 

Go there and arrest the interventionists? 

I might do it as a high-tech civilization so the original folks might still be alive centuries later when a new fleet arrives. 

But what about their descendants? 

Regardless of whether the originals are still around, can you arrest their descendants? 

Can you forcibly deport them? 

No other punishment just remove them? 

If they resist can you kill them? 

What about the original civilization? 

Do you take their technology away? 

Or repeat what the asteroid would have done and nuke the place from orbit? 

Not many people would be okay with the latter, I hope, but that’s the only one that really has teeth as a deterrent. 

If you believe letting that civilization die from an asteroid strike is wrong, odds are you will take action regardless of whether or not it means a prison term or even death, so your only deterrent is knowing it would be all for nothing, that the armada is going to come by and torch the place and reverse what you did. 

And of course if the interventionists think that is a possibility, they might still do it, and gamble on the chance that in the centuries they have before word gets home and a fleet arrives, they can bootstrap the local civilization up to the point they have a chance to resist. 

Indeed, considering the alternatives to not working fast enough, they have an excuse to outright play gods to establish and maintain enough control over the local population to get everyone working on increasing their numbers and accepting the new technology and turning over every bright kid to them for science and engineering educations. 

One might even argue it is better to play false gods to save a civilization than let it be wiped out. 

They can even rationalize that they’re going to turn themselves over after the crisis for judgment, content to pay for that deception with their lives if that’s what it takes. 

What we don’t see in Star Trek or fiction following a similar code is the Enterprise firing on some ship that is headed for a primitive planet with the intent to give them technology. 

Considering what we know of that Universe, anyone sufficiently determined can get their hands on or build their own warp-capable ship, and I assume they don’t classify their discoveries of new civilizations. 

So someone back on Earth who disagrees with the Prime Directive can go replicate or requisition parts for a spacecraft. 

What would they do to a group of folks who were building a ship and flat out said they plan to fly to the newest discovered planet with primitives and say hello and tell the aliens how to build stuff? 

Do they arrest them? 

Confiscate the ship? 

Quite possibly. 

What if they don’t say what the ship is for, do you warn them off and shoot them down while approaching the planet? 

Do they keep a fleet around each such planet for such occasions? 

What about aliens not in the Federation? 

Do they shoot down an alien research team from a species that doesn’t follow the Prime Directive? 

This is why it doesn’t work well for the Fermi Paradox, because we cannot expect every civilization to follow such a principle, and we can’t expect all their members to either, and it’s hard to imagine how you would enforce it over thousands or even millions of years. 

Is there some graveyard of ships floating around our solar system where aliens tried to run the blockade to help or exploit us and got shot down? 

Probably not. 

Let’s assume there was though, and that normally when you get interstellar capable they come in and say hi. 

When and how should they do it? 

Most of us would say that specific technology is a trifle arbitrary, a simple nod to pragmatism rather than assuming it implies the civilization is somehow more immune to cultural contamination by having it. 

We often see in fiction the enlightened race showing up to talk to a civilization about our technology level, and usually quietly. 

This brings up the issue of whether or not it’s okay to introduce yourselves a bit early if you know that they might be about to kill themselves off in the next 20 years, but will almost certainly make it to interstellar travel in the next 10-30 years, and you can have the same argument as before. 

The XO says no, the science officer suggests sneaking them some vital piece of tech by email, a design for cheap and easy solar panels and batteries for instance, and the engineer just says screw it, call them up and introduce yourselves and offer them the technology one generation early. 

In a case like this, the captain might be more inclined to go with the direct and open intervention route, or at least try a secret introduction to their leaders. 

Of course we don’t know how aliens will view interacting with other civilizations, the flaw of the Zoo Hypothesis and Prime Directive from a Fermi Paradox standpoint comes from it being very hard to see all of them sharing the same view, or anyone being willing or able to enforce it on those who did not. 

After all, we do have professional policies about how zoologists or news reporters are supposed to act when in the field, not interfering just observing, but it’s not like that’s actually enforced. 

So it would seem a Fermi Paradox solution that can’t be valid because it is unlikely to practical to enforce it. 

However, the basic notion of the Zoo Hypothesis is actually a little more subtle. 

Because what folks often miss is that the Fermi Paradox assumes we are looking up at the actual Universe and seeing it empty when it isn’t. 

Unless by some freak coincidence all the high-tech alien machinery and empires are conveniently invisible, which would be rather weird, you don’t make a zoo for primitives by limiting your own civilization, you do it by creating a fake environment around them. 

When we build a zoo near a city, we don’t deconstruct our skyscrapers, we create a habitat that conceals those aspects of our civilization that we need to for their well-being. 

So if you are making a zoo out of Earth, you don’t go deconstructing your own Dyson Spheres, you make a big one around Earth or our whole solar system that creates an illusion. 

That’s an immense project but way easier than limiting what you do in the rest of the galaxy. 

And it doesn’t need to be solar system sized either, I mean it probably isn’t that hard to snatch up unmanned probes and fake the data coming back, or even manned missions and trick the crews. 

But that fake Zoo Universe doesn’t necessarily even need to resemble the real one. 

Easier to protect that zoo too, it’s small and cut off, so you don’t have to worry about somebody sending a rogue hello signal into the zoo. 

However, that maybe doesn’t go far enough. 

We often discuss advanced aliens as being a sort of higher entity, in the softer kind of science fiction this is usually some being of pure energy evolved to a higher plane of existence or such, but we often just assume they aren’t organic anymore instead. 

We’ll talk more about artificial intelligence in a couple weeks but for the moment, imagine some civilization that had gone digital. 

They all live in this Universe, or their Universe rather, but essentially inside computers. 

They will consider that sort of existence just as good as a biological one, probably a lot more preferable since it is likely to be vastly more efficient in terms of resources and energy to support one individual thinking entity. 

That means there is a decent chance they converted their home planet into one big computer and just took copies of all the DNA than uploaded all the animals into it too. 

Not just digital people, but digital cats and dogs and even honey bees. 

They could always grow or print up a new organic body for themselves or those critters if they needed to, from digital DNA archives. 

So from their perspective, what is the best way to make sure a primitive civilization is protected? 

There’s a good chance the answer they came up with was to upload them. 

Just send in some covert missile carrying self-replicating machines to land somewhere on the planet, do some self-replicating underground while studying the biology for the needed specifications, then one moment someone is walking out their front door in the real universe and maybe stumbles a bit, before proceeding on, not realizing that they stumbled when some nano-machines stabbed a spike out of the ground into their brain and copied it, and every person and animal there, while cheerfully disassembling the planet to make a giant computer. 

So you recover from your stumble a few thousand years later inside some secure processor running on a Matrioshka Brain in their home system, or maybe around our own Sun, and the aliens who maintain that simulated Earth keep some back ups, but you and every person and critter you know is safely tucked inside a simulated environment deep inside their territory protected by the kinds of mega-armadas and defenses some sprawling K2+ civilizations can muster. 

See the Matrioshka Brain and Kardashev Scale episodes for details. 

Maybe when you die you wake up in their afterlife, or just get stored until the civilization you are from reaches a level where they’re comfortable being purely digital and they pop in to say hi and offer you wider access to things. 

As far as they are concerned, they did you a favor. 

Heck, they didn’t even need to grey goo your planet, they could have taken mental snapshots of everyone and left us as is, and kept those running instead to preserve things. 

We might object that they killed us and stuck us in a simulation, but they might smirk back at the contradictions in that statement and regard the objection as being the same as someone complaining that taking a photograph of them stole their soul. 

That’s what I meant earlier about the Zoo Hypothesis being both a very bad and very good solution to the Fermi Paradox, and also about how it didn’t really matter. 

Because it is essentially the Simulation Hypothesis at that point, and we’ve discussed that in terms of the Fermi Paradox before also. 

Whether the Universe we are in is real or not, doesn’t make too much difference to the Fermi Paradox. 

First, all our observations about the Universe that leads us to seeing a Fermi Paradox wouldn’t apply to the Universe simulating us, the true reality as it were, which might be some 4 dimensional place, or have stars that actually orbit planets and trillions of them per galaxy for all we know, with space being a nice shade of blue instead of black. 

Second, if they are simulating the original Universe, or just simulating an entire made-up Universe, it can be assumed they kept it decently self-consistent, so that it makes sense on inspection. 

Meaning that the Fermi Paradox would have a logical answer internally consistent with the observable, if fake, universe. 

The simulators, who designed the place, can be expected to not to leave blatant paradoxes and contradictions all over it if the goal is to keep us in the dark… of course it might not be. 

But fundamentally, whether it’s that case or the more classic non-interference approach, while you can make arguments both for and against the ethics of these approaches, there is something kind of smug and superior about the approach. 

That’s an opinion obviously, and I won’t deny there’s good arguments for keeping quiet, but for my part I’d tend to think the best approach to non-interference in a culture is like the best approach to keeping people away from your civilization. 

In that case we said you wouldn’t hide, you’d just do the equivalent of hanging no trespassing signs around your territory. 

For non-interference, I’d tend to think you’d be best off just introducing yourself, and telling them how to reach you if they want to talk. 

It seems more practical and ethical, and the alternatives don’t really seem viable anyhow, except of course for showing up and uploading the entire planet, which is undeniably pretty effective. 

Next week we’ll be looking at the other approach, of directly contacting primitive civilizations with little technology or even no technology at all, and tweaking their minds and physiology to be able to use technology, a concept called Uplifting. 

That will be a two part collaboration episode with John Michael Godier, with the first part on this channel and the second on his. 

The week after that we will be starting a discussion on Artificial Intelligence with a look at Androids, and we will try to sort out some common myths and misconceptions we often get on that topic. 

The week after that it will be back to the Outward Bound series to look at Colonizing Titan, and we will explore the option for colonizing Saturn’s largest moon along with looking at some of the concepts for robotic colonization of the solar system.

Outward Bound: Colonizing Venus
---

Until the 1960s it was Venus, not Mars, that everyone assumed we would first colonize and terraform, as it turns out, they may have been correct after all. 

So today we will be following up our look at Colonizing Mars by exploring the options for colonizing and terraforming Venus, and we will see that it is probably the best prospect for true terraforming inside this solar system. 

Until the 1960s, we thought it very likely it might be a paradise planet. 

It had clouds and was closer to the Sun than us, but we didn’t know until we got a better look that it was super-hot and had a day longer than its year, that indeed will be the trickiest part to properly terraforming it, as we’ll see later. 

We knew its mass was 82% of Earth’s, and its surface gravity was 90% of Earth’s, and again since we could see clouds we figured there was a chance it might be habitable or even inhabited. 

As observations improved we found it wasn’t a paradise but a good deal closer to a very hot oven. 

Even the clouds are made of sulfuric acid. 

At the same time, we discovered it’s quite possible that had not always been true. 

Indeed, Venus might have been a lot more Earth-like in the distant past, and maybe even hosted life. 

But while we can look at Mars and say maybe it once did too, and cross our fingers of finding fossil evidence of that, it’s very unlikely any evidence would remain on Venus if it ever had life, as the surface has been periodically resurfaced by floods of lava. 

Venus has the most volcanoes of any planet in the solar system. 

So when we found out how extremely hot this planet was, most folks scratched colonizing Venus off the list, and yet as we’ll see, it’s not only a decent colony location, but a great one for terraforming as well. 

When we left off last time in the Colonizing Mars episode, we followed a traveler who went to Mars and explored the options for colonizing it. 

That traveler spent several years there and has since decided to go home and returned to Borman Station, our large space station above the Moon. 

I mentioned then that the Moon and Earth’s orbit were decently settled already, but that besides Mars and a few asteroid mines, the only other manned mission in the solar system was a floating scientific outpost above Venus. 

That mission has wrapped up and just been replaced by the first settlement floating in the clouds, and the ship that brought it there returned with the crew from the outpost. 

When we get back to Borman Station that crew has also just arrived themselves, to much fanfare. 

We get to talking to one of the members and she happily recounts the basics. 

Venus has a very thick atmosphere, about 100 times that of Earth, in defiance of its very minimal magnetosphere and proximity to the Sun, both of which should tend to result in losing your atmosphere. 

That atmosphere is almost all carbon dioxide, with just over 3% being nitrogen and only trace amounts of other gasses. 

And yet, even though Earth’s atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, Venus’s atmosphere has more nitrogen than Earth’s simply because it has so much more atmosphere. 

Down on the surface the supercritical carbon dioxide forms a sea, having characteristics of both a liquid and gas, which will be important for terraforming the planet. 

However, like any atmosphere, the higher up you get the thinner it gets, and it cools down too. 

At about 50 to 55 kilometers up, the atmosphere is down to about normal Earth pressure and temperature. 

While pressure and temperature are now approximately that of Earth, the gas mix is still almost entirely carbon dioxide, which has a molecular weight of 44, so any gas with a lower molecular weight can act as a lifting gas like hydrogen or helium do on Earth. 

That means that hydrogen and helium, with a molecular weight of 2 and 4 respectively, work even better on Venus than on Earth, but it also means that even our normal oxygen-nitrogen air mix with an average molecular weight of 29 would float a balloon on Venus. 

That’s obviously advantageous, since it means a room full of air will float, assuming the room and its other contents aren’t too heavy, but hydrogen and helium are still better. 

They are in dreadfully short supply on Venus though. 

However the lack of oxygen in the air also means that hydrogen is a much safer lifting gas than on Earth, and you can get hydrogen, oxygen and water out of the sulfuric acid that makes up the clouds. 

So while it is neat and handy that normal air is a lifting gas on Venus, you probably want the majority of your lifting done by hydrogen anyway. 

Up in the higher atmosphere the lighting is a lot like on Earth, except that if you stay in the same spot you will have a day-night cycle not of 24 hours but 243 days. 

Since the day-night terminator creeps along at a fast walking pace even at the equator, you can opt to stay in perpetual sunlight if you want to, making it handy for solar power or growing plants to help recycle air and water, and extend food supplies. 

We tend to think of blimps needing to be very small and light, but you can make some large blimps, potentially some very large and sturdy ones with mass manufacture of graphene, and carbon for making graphene is hardly in short supply on Venus. 

You could potentially use that for making diamond hard tethers anchoring you to the ground, possibly able to survive the super-hot, acidic, hurricane below, or use them like harpoons with a winch to drag your settlement around like a big octopus. 

But we also have a super-abundance of solar to power engines, and all that wind lets you consider using wings to provide lift, like a plane or kite, not just buoyancy. 

Many normal restrictions get eased with enough energy and strong enough materials. 

So there are a lot of options for moving around up there in the clouds. 

And our companion on Borman Station is quite upbeat about the idea of building even larger habitats in the clouds of Venus. 

Floating islands in the sky. 

However, we are fresh back from Mars, and the problems they were having there, so we ask her why you would want to do that. 

She’s just spent a couple years with a research team that are very enthusiastic about Venus, and knows we just came from Mars, so she is a bit taken aback by the question. 

From her perspective, ‘because we can’ is quite a sufficient motivation. 

But back on Mars, we were already seeing some of the problems that happen as a colony gets big enough that science and prestige are no longer good motivations for getting bigger. 

We’re all for the Venus mission and even a permanent floating habitat there, but the notion of building thousands of giant floating cities seems harder to justify. 

We say as much and she points out that it’s no different than Martian domes, indeed those floating habitats are easier to construct and maintain in many respects. 

They can’t just mine up rock to build more, but there’s plenty of material down on the planet and we can build mining robots to be controlled from the floating habitats that can handle the heat and pressure and potentially deliver those goods by either going up a tether or popping compressed gas cartridges to fill balloons and float back up. 

Mars has the option to simply dome over the entire planet, with various sized domes connected together, a thing called a ‘worldhouse’, Venus could do the same. 

This approach, known as para-terraforming, could produce archipelagos of floating habitats around Venus or even entire continents of space eventually. 

But as we saw on Mars, it’s not too clear why you would do this at that scale. 

Sure you can float cities on Venus, but they still have to be very thin and light to float, and you can just orbit the planet in more conventional rotating habitats instead, like the one you’re on now. 

She points out that being low in the atmosphere protects you from meteors and some radiation, and that the orbital speed around Venus is not much lower than Earth, so the settlement can float right over a spot you are mining. 

We point out that those orbital settlements can have very thick radiation shielding, which also helps against meteors, which we can also shoot down, but these floating habitats have to be ultra-light. 

So they’ve got the radiation concerns of early space travel when every kilogram on board a ship cost a fortune so shielding had to be kept to a minimum. 

Same now for Venus. 

It has no magnetosphere of note, so its radiation protection comes from that super-thick atmosphere, and the cloud habitats float over most of that. 

We can put our blimps and water storage over the settlement to add some shielding, but radiation remains a concern. 

We’re not convinced about the practicality of this approach but we still decide we have to see it for our ourselves. 

Since they are sending the ship back to Venus with the second round of colonists for that first floating settlement, and we are already here at Borman Station and trained in space travel, we decide to put off returning to Earth and join the crew. 

When we went to Mars, it was already decently settled with several thousand colonists. 

Venus is less built up, just a few hundred colonists on that first floating settlement, Niobe, and a few dozen at their space station, Vulcan. 

It’s a shorter trip than to Mars, as Venus is closer to Earth, but it’s still long enough to get to know the other crewmembers. 

We regale them with tales of Mars, as we’ve seen things these people wouldn’t believe. 

Standing atop the peak of Olympus Mons, hang gliding through the canyons in Valles Marineris, attack ships off the shoulder of Orion, well that last one didn’t happen, but we tell them anyway, many an awesome sight. 

When we arrive at Vulcan Station in orbit around Venus, we see it is a different setup than with the Space Elevators from Tharsis Station on Mars or Earth’s Orbital Ring. 

Venus hasn’t got anything like the infrastructure for an orbital ring yet, and its gravity is too high for the space elevators we have at the Moon and Mars. 

Lower than Earth, but still too high. 

Vulcan Station uses a rotating skyhook design, or rotavator. 

It’s a simple, small habitat at the center of a long tether that spins in a circle as the whole thing orbits the planet. 

While the whole system orbits Venus just a little slower than satellites around Earth, the tip of tether spins backwards, canceling out some of that velocity, making it easier for ships to enter or leave the thick atmosphere to or from the tether tip. 

We come in on a shuttle much like an airplane, and airbrake down to land on a large floating runway. 

It’s pretty neat landing on a runway that just floats in the clouds, and we park next to a wall designed to keep the wind off us as we exit wearing nothing but a simple acid- resistant suit and breathing mask. 

Clouds above, clouds below. 

We’ve stood on top of Olympus Mons, more than twice as high as the peak of Mount Everest, and right now we’re more than twice as high as that. 

It is quite a sight and worth the trip. 

There’s no ground to see below, it’s like looking upside down at a hurricane. 

Once that awe passes and the ship is unpacked, we find ourselves confronted by the same concerns we expressed earlier though. 

What is the appeal to major settlement here? 

We can see a lot of tourism, it’s not that long of a trip and you can wander around outside without a heavy suit. 

While we are working our way to the main structure, we are nearly clipped by a colonist flying overhead learning the ropes of hang-gliding with just a simple air tank, mask, and a thin acid-proof suit. 

Those clouds are pretty, but still made of sulphuric acid. 

The equipment at this settlement is a lot newer than the stuff on Mars, which was settled a couple of decades before we first visited several years back, so it is a lot more automated here and folks have more free time. 

We remark on this to one of the first wave of settlers, as we settle in at the Venutian Café, and he chuckles and says in the future the first wave will be entirely robotic, and the folks talking about colonizing Titan in a few years are planning to go entirely robots and cyborgs. 

None of that here though, part of the appeal of Venus is how Earth-like it can be, he says, no need to be a cyborg or get tweaked genetically to live here, you need a breathing mask and an acid-proof skinsuit when outside, for now, but that’s it. 

No, Venus is ideal for Terraforming, down the road of course. 

It will be monstrously expensive though, and Venus hasn’t got much for trade. 

In fact, the thing it has an ample surplus of is carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the atmosphere, and energy for industrial processes. 

If Mars wants to terraform itself, it will need a lot of that nitrogen, and even if they just want to para-terraform the planet they’ll still need plenty. 

If not, well all those rotating habitats being built around Earth need nitrogen too, and carbon might be abundant but it’s also something we always need a lot of. 

He envisions a huge floating mass driver launching giant, thin-walled pods of nitrogen, and if Mars wants them for actual terraforming, they don’t even need to land them. 

They can just machine gun them at the planet to explode on arrival and have the fragments of the pod burn up in the atmosphere. 

They can get the metal for the pods from down below. 

Of course, mining the surface, which is essentially under a super-hot acid hurricane, is rather tricky, at least until they can terraform Venus properly. 

We’re curious about that and ask how. 

After all, the clouds are fine but down below it’s still a hellish landscape around 462 °C; or 863 °F He shrugs, what makes Venus hot is its proximity to the Sun. 

There’s other factors, greenhouse gases gone wild for instance, but if you shut off the heat pump from the Sun, it will cool down. 

We raise an eyebrow at that, the Sun does not come with an on off switch and moving planets is quite outside our reach, for now anyway. 

But he reminds us that there is only empty space between the Sun and Venus, block the light, and you block the heat. 

Every planet has Lagrange points, specifically an L-1 Lagrange point in between that planet and the Sun. 

Normally the closer to the Sun you are the faster you orbit, so if we placed an object between us and the Sun it would not stay there. 

We can simply place a shade there, or mirror, to reflect light away, it need not be very thick or massive, though if it is too thin or fragile, we won’t be able to cope with the solar wind. 

If it is too thick though, we would have problems keeping it in place, since L-1 points are only marginally stable. 

Thin ones can use the light hitting them to maneuver a bit, like a solar sail, so we don’t need fuel. 

So these shades aren’t exactly just a piece of foil. 

Your typical one might be as big as a football field when deployed, but not weigh much, and devote a fair portion of that weight to manipulating the sail, the electronics to figure out how much and when, and some solar panels and batteries to power both processes. 

Ideally, you want something very light and strong, like graphene made of carbon, so you can manufacture them back on the cloud cities of Venus, deploying them to the L-1 point by the millions until you shade the entire planet. 

Venus’s atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, and we could also remove it from the planet. 

Indeed, that might be the better option. 

But if we block the light, the atmosphere will begin to cool, and at the pressures on Venus, it will liquefy at about room temperature. 

So you’d lose the thick atmosphere in favor of seas of liquid carbon dioxide, and if we kept cooling it, the carbon dioxide would freeze and the surface would all be dry ice. 

If we wanted to we could pave that over, remove enough of the solar shades to keep Venus at a comfortable Earth-like temperature, and introduce dirt and water. 

We have to interrupt our companion though. 

Certainly there’s no shortage of potential dirt, but water is another story. 

There’s a decent amount of water in Venus’s thick atmosphere and all that sulfuric acid can be dissociated into water and SO3, but it isn’t enough for real oceans. 

Venus’s entire atmosphere is incredibly massive, about a third the mass of Earth’s oceans, but only a small fraction of it is water or hydrogen we could use to make water. 

Plenty for people to drink and grow food with inside greenhouses, but not enough for a classic biosphere. 

For that we’d need to come up with somewhere between 10-100 billion megatons of hydrogen. 

Our companion nods, hydrogen is an issue. 

It’s the most plentiful stuff in the Universe, and the solar system too, but outside of the Sun itself the only real supplies of hydrogen are the gas giants. 

The Sun’s solar wind is a good source of hydrogen, it blows out about a billion kilograms of hydrogen a second, a megaton, but again we need 10-100 billion megatons, and 10-100 billion seconds is 3000-30,000 years, and that’s if we gathered it all up, and it goes out in every direction. 

We could bring in ices from further out but that’s a more precious commodity and truth be told, we really only want the hydrogen which is only about a tenth of a water molecules’ mass anyway, so easier to move. 

If we can get star lifting working, we could boil hydrogen off the Sun, indeed, we could use that trick to clear the atmosphere on Venus too, using solar mirrors instead of shades to heat the planet even more and evaporate the atmosphere away. 

Some folks have even been discussing how you could colonize the Sun itself, and they could ship hydrogen to Venus or even just aim a diffuse beam of hydrogen at the planet, but he thinks such ideas are still a little too blue sky to be taken seriously. 

Better, he thinks, to bring the hydrogen in from Jupiter or Saturn. 

That would be the trade item Venus wants to import, hydrogen, which is in plentiful supply even compared to their huge need for it. 

All of which sounds good, it’s actually a little less ambitious than the Terraforming of Mars by bringing in nitrogen, since you need a lot more of it by mass than Venus needs in hydrogen, and you would end with an Earth-like planet, not a low gravity one. 

Except for the daylength issue. 

Again, Venus’s day is longer than its year, so the Sun is going to rise and stay there for months before setting for more months. 

We’ve got three possible approaches to this, he says. 

First we can just ignore it, and adapt life there for that condition. 

Same as the bioformers on Mars were thinking about adapting life to live on Mars or meet halfway in the middle. 

However, Venus is the only planet in the solar system we can realistically classically terraform, so half-measures seem kind of wrong. 

He points out that we already will have solar shades to limit the amount of light getting to Venus, so it doesn’t overheat, so we could go in for mirrors too. 

Mirrors on a 24 hour orbit around Venus could be arranged to block incoming sunlight on the sun-side and bounce light down on the dark-side, and done so as to simulate a normal 24 hour day. 

You could even make a decent fake sun that way. 

Lots of mirrors that bounce light to something about the same angular size in the sky as the Sun, which bounces it down to Venus. 

That would look very natural even. 

All those mirrors and shades would help protect Venus from radiation too, though we’d probably still want to consider an artificial magnetosphere like was planned for Mars, to hold the atmosphere in. 

We can’t expect that to stick around on its own once we make it Earth-like. 

The other alternative is to go all-in, and actually adjust Venus’s rotational speed to a 24 hour day, or maybe save some energy and let people sleep in longer with a 26 hour day. 

We have to raise an eyebrow at this though. 

From a physics perspective it is certainly possible, but it takes a lot of energy. 

We would need to add over 10^29 joules of rotational energy to Venus to do this. 

That’s a lot of energy. 

And yet, it also isn’t, relatively speaking. 

We needed to ship those massive quantities of hydrogen to Venus to give it real oceans, and that’s going to require fairly similar levels of energy too, it’s in the same ballpark, shipping in an ocean versus spinning up a planet. 

While 10^29 joules of energy seems enormous, and it is more than a billion times the amount of electricity 21st century Earth used each year, it’s also only a few minutes of total energy output from the Sun. 

Similarly, it is about 10,000 years worth of solar energy hitting Venus, much of which we want to block anyway. 

And if we can build a planet’s worth of shades, we can build that much, or more, of solar panels too. 

It’s tricky to convert that into rotational energy though. 

You can’t just put a big rocket thruster on a planet, especially one you want to cool down. 

Even hitting it with energy beams, like spraying a large ball with a hose on one side to make it spin, is going to add a lot of heat too. 

In fact, that might work with the hydrogen as well, a big beam of it coming from the sun like a water jet, hitting one side of the planet and injecting hydrogen and spin at the same time. 

But if we are shipping in hydrogen from gas giants instead, each of those ships or pods is moving quite fast and carrying a lot of kinetic energy, and as mentioned, the amount needed for transport is in the same ballpark as rotational energy. 

So we just figure out how much hydrogen we want, and how much rotational energy we need, and make sure each pod full of hydrogen arriving is moving at a speed to deliver that energy. 

Indeed, if that were too fast, we might go ahead and ship in ice instead of just hydrogen, and let that extra mass carry the extra kinetic energy. 

We would kind of prefer slow because we want to keep that mass, not having a ton of it explode out into space and wander away. 

Which is a big issue when just hitting planets with asteroids or comets. 

It would be tricky to get that process to work, aiming big chunks of ice or pods of hydrogen to impact Venus near the equator on its edge to impart the maximum spin, but it’s doable, and gets you two birds with one stone. 

Indeed possibly three since if Venus is spinning faster it might have a strong enough magnetosphere not to need an artificial one. 

We also have the option of giving Venus a moon, you can use those as gravity tractors to move planets or impart spin too, and the outer planets have an abundant supply of them they’re not using, most of them have a surplus of hydrogen too, so you could move one in, again multiple birds with one stone. 

Of course, you could also take a lot of that excess carbon from Venus and make one, either a full moon or a thick shell full of hydrogen or some other filler material. 

Building planets, or evens moons, sounds like a huge project, but so is Terraforming in general. 

Such things would take thousands of years, you can only go as fast as the planet can get rid of the heat, but Terraforming is always going to be a long game. 

They don’t have to make any decisions on it yet, they’re just a floating settlement of a few hundred folks, but those are their options. 

They can go the orbital colony route, the floating cities route, the para-terraforming route, where they shade the planet to cool it down and use orbital mirrors to produce a realistic day, or go big and start slowly spinning the planet up to a 24 hour day, where possible by using incoming shipments of hydrogen or water to impart much of that spin momentum. 

Again, they don’t have to decide yet, but the floating colonies can’t survive the cool down process when the atmosphere eventually liquefies. 

You would probably have to abandon them and retreat to orbital colonies, unless you could figure out a way to safely modify them to float in the air, then land on the carbon dioxide sea, then transition to be being in enclosed habitats on the surface as you make the changeover to early terraforming. 

We expect that during cooling you’d get a ton of earthquakes and maybe volcanic activity, while it snows dry ice and you eventually have to pick a way to either export or permanently sequester all that carbon dioxide so you can warm the planet up to Earth-like temperature and atmosphere composition. 

There’s plenty of solid things you can make out of carbon and oxygen but they all take a lot of energy and even when you have plenty to spare, you do have to worry about that releasing heat, even for endothermic processes. 

It is doable, but I tend to think that carbon in the form of graphene is going to be the prefered building material in the future so Venus might export gigatons of that. 

So we have a lot of options for Venus, and as with Mars, we don’t necessarily have to only do one, you could have many phases with different configurations or with more than one option pursued simultaneously where they can be, but I think that Venus, as the only planet really suitable for total terraforming, is more likely to be terraformed, and all the way too. 

You’d always need some solar shades to keep the heat down, but heck we might need those on Earth eventually and you can make it so they are seemingly invisible, just cutting down on some of the light and particularly from the frequencies like infrared we can’t even see. 

You can even move a planet if you really want to, but that takes far more energy than even spinning it would. 

Colonizing though does not necessarily mean terraforming, as we saw with Mars and we will see even more in the next episode in the series, Colonizing Titan. 

Next week though, we are going to look at the extreme alternative to Terraforming, where you just build your planets instead, and return to the Megastructures series to look at Ringworlds, giant orbital habitats so large they wrap around an entire star and provide a million times the living area of Earth, first suggested by author Larry Niven in his classic sci-fi novel, Ringworld. 

Since unsurprisingly that is going to be our September Book of the Month, sponsored by Audible, and we’ll be doing some spoilers, you might want to click the link in the video description to grab a copy of the audiobook before then, if you haven't already read it, though I will try to leave the story itself mostly unspoiled in our discussion of the megastructure itself. 

The week after that we will be celebrating the Third Anniversary of the channel, and the original Megastructures episode, along with the 100th episode on the channel, with Smug Aliens, and discuss some concepts like the Zoo Hypothesis and Star Trek Prime Directive. 

And we will finish up the month of September with a two part episode collaboration with John Michael Godier to look at Uplifting, the exact opposite of the Prime Directive, where you visit planets without any technology and give it to them, along with possibly altering them to have the brains and physiology to use it.

Interplanetary Warfare

2017-08-31  
https://youtu.be/Mg8eJZ08_0Q  

---

In the future technology will ensure prosperity for everyone, which also means you have got a lot more money to spend on giant space guns. 

We’ve discussed some basic concepts of space warfare before, and in the general context of futuristic warfare, you essentially have four areas of interests. Relatively close combat like infantry, combat in atmospheres or orbit, and interplanetary or interstellar conflicts. Our focus is on Interplanetary for today, which differs from fighting on or near a planet because of light lag, which is even more severe for interstellar warfare, and we’ll discuss both another time. 

Because of the time it takes light to travel, conflict timelines get expanded to time scales similar to those of pre-modern naval warfare. Communications take a long while and travel longer, weeks if not months, and even exchanging fire is likely to be something that takes hours or days, not seconds or minutes. That’s Rule #1 of Warfare, you spend 99% of your time waiting followed by brief moments of excitement and terror. But in the case of interplanetary warfare that upgrades to 99.9% thumb twiddling even when you are actively exchanging fire with someone. We talked a fair amount about that in the original Space Warfare episode, but our focus was just on the space battle aspect, not the strategic situation, and that probably needs clearing up first. 

Recently on the channel we’ve been looking at colonization of the solar system, focusing on planets, our own moon, and asteroids. In science fiction we often focus on those too, as the major players in any conflict. Earth versus Mars, like we see in the show The Expanse. 

Great show but I doubt that will ever happen. For it to happen, space travel has to be abundant and cheap enough for at least tens of millions of people to travel in space every year. Otherwise there’s no real option for conflict. It’s not some one-sided conflict like Australia versus all of Eurasia, it’s more like Eurasia versus a small, under-developed Pacific Island. 

Mars ain’t pushing Earth and its billions around with a few million residents. 

And while scifi often likes to present us a resource-strapped, over-populated Earth versus a more high-tech Martian colony where all the scientists live, Earth is not going to be resource strapped, see the Ecumenopolis episode, and not all the scientists are going to move to Mars. If you’ve got space travel cheap enough for mass colonization, you don’t have energy shortages, and that means any planet is a ridiculous powerhouse in terms of resources. But more importantly, by the time you’ve got planets all colonized, you also probably are no longer planet-centered. Even before you get to the Dyson Swarm, Kardashev 2 level of things, you’ve got hordes of habitats in every rock floating around out there, and there are thousands of them big enough to support an entire modern planetary population and economy for geological time spans. 

Short form, if you’ve got interplanetary military conflicts it is because you have cheap space travel, and that is because you have energy abundance, if you have energy abundance, every rock in space is a super-valuable gold mine that you can turn into lush, human friendly environment. So the stage at which such conflicts can begin occurring isn’t a few settled planets acting as big superpowers, but rather a period more akin to a thousand city-states, out around the big colonizable rocky planets of the inner system. The dynamic changes again as you start shifting toward a Dyson Swarm. 

Let’s start by examining the classic Earth-Mars conflict. It’s probably important to know what the heck they are actually fighting over, but we’ve had a fair number of wars over fairly surprising things. Of course, sometimes the official recorded reasons are bizarre, but the unofficial actual reasons are entirely logical. It’s not terribly ethical to invade your neighbor because you want their stuff, but it’s decently logical, it generally helps to give a reason like they insulted the king or something. Though historically, ‘we want your stuff’ has often been an entirely acceptable official justification for war too. It does not apply to Earth and Mars, I don’t know any plausible scenario where Earth wants anything Mars has, not while there is still a Moon in the sky and a system population of less than a quadrillion. When you’re fighting over raw materials at the planetary scale, it isn’t planet on planet combat. 

Each planet is a budding Kardashev 2 civilization that now occupies the region of space the planet did. But fighting for general solar system dominance or trade rights is on the table, and one can always find an excuse. In any event, one of the first issues with attacking another planet in your own solar system is all the space in between the two of you. That distance falls into that scale our brain tends to only comprehend as Very Large. If you’ve ever taken a road trip that lasted all day, think of doing that all day every day. You will still die of old age before arriving at another planet, but your grandkids born on the trip might live to set foot on one of the closer planets. Missiles, of course, travel a lot faster, but we can flat out discard any up-sized equivalent of an ICBM. No chemically powered rocket can deliver warheads to another planet. Not because they can’t get there of course, but rather because the target is going to casually blow every one of them away. They just can’t go very fast, and will need to go even slower if they want to save any fuel for maneuvering. 

And you need that because such missiles are not even a little bit stealthy, so the only way to avoid them getting shot by a laser is if they routinely jink in a random direction, like we discussed in the Space Warfare episode. You could maybe do it with metallic hydrogen if we can make that a viable fuel, but even that is iffy. So too would the typical atomic rockets we discussed in the Nuclear Option. You need a compact and high powered fusion drive or anti-matter for a self-contained, interplanetary missile to be a threat. 

Fortunately the difference between a missile and a ship, is one of them doesn’t need to carry fuel to slow down, and also tend to be unmanned, so you can get away with launching one out of a mass driver. This has a downside though, because for missiles to be good weapons when someone has the ability to shoot them down, you need them all to show up at the target, or the edge of its anti-missile envelope, at the same time. Volleys arriving together not a stream of them like a machinegun. That’s the cool thing about modern-missiles, they are all self-contained, so you can launch your entire inventory all at once, you don’t need queue them up like bullets in a gun. If you are instead using a launch system like a mass driver to get those missiles up to speed, with their fuel just for maneuvering, you need a launcher for each missile, or they won’t come in as a volley. 

Now at interstellar distances, as we discussed with Relativistic Kill Missiles, you can fire thousands of the things once a day, each a little faster than the last, and expect them to arrive on time. Like sending a vehicle out on a road trip every minute, with the first traveling 61 miles per hour, the second 62, the third 63, and so on so they all arrive at the same time. At interplanetary distance and desired speeds, you can still do this trick but not nearly as well. You are essentially trying to overwhelm a system that’s firing as fast as it can recharge and retarget, so the faster your devices are moving, and the more fuel they have to maneuver, the smaller that window of time is. Same reason, you want something that can break into a lot of pieces when it hits that interception envelope. The nice thing though, about very fast missiles is they can fragment a lot because they don’t need to carry a warhead. Missiles moving several times the speed of sound carry more kinetic energy than would be released by their weight in explosives, missiles moving at relativistic speeds do as much damage as a nuke would. 

So this is a basic interplanetary missile. A question then becomes how fast can you throw one initially and that comes down to two basic maximums, though all sorts of engineering difficulties could limit it more. How fast can the missile accelerate without trashing its guidance system and how long can you accelerate it, or basically how long your launch track is. Humans can’t handle prolonged acceleration of a dozen, much less hundreds, of g-forces, but solid metal slugs can handle thousands of times more, they don’t have electronics in them. Modern military artillery have electronics in them rated to handle over 15,000 gees, and you might be able to go higher with better technology, but we’ll assume that value at 150,000 m/s². 

Length is important in this context, it tells us how long our gun needs to be and also how close the missile can get without being automatically destroyed by anything detecting and shooting at the speed of light. 15,000 gees might sound remarkable but is in the ballpark of many conventional firearms. A barrel length of about a foot or third of meter would allow an acceleration only up to about the speed of sound, slower than most guns spit out a bullet. This is one of the reasons trying to put electronics or machinery in normal bullets is harder than folks assume. Final speed rises with the square root of length, so a barrel 100 times longer, 30 meters, gives you the square root of 100 or 10 times the velocity. 3000 meters, 100 times the velocity, 30 km/s, 300 kilometers and 300 km/s, 0.1% light speed. You need a track length of 30,000 kilometers to get to 1% of light speed and 3 million for 10%. Those are obviously ridiculously long gun lengths but keep in mind ‘length’ is ambiguous here, you might be pushing on it with laser after it leaves the gun for more speed, or the barrel might be simple thin mesh of superconducting wire you shot out right before shooting the missile. And its not really that each missile needs its own launcher as it needs its own power supply. On the interception end, we’ve got two factors, first how quickly the missile is moving and second how quickly it can randomly accelerate in a given direction to jink. For any given combination of missile speed, size, and acceleration rate you have a window of space and time you can shoot it and be sure to hit with a laser. 

See the Space Warfare episode for details on that but all things being equal you want the smallest, fastest, and most maneuverable missile you can build and anything moving less than .1% of light speed probably isn’t even worth shooting at interplanetary ranges, because any orbital defense laser is going to get many shots at while it is in the no-miss automatic kill envelope. Of course that envelope’s size depends on the missile’s size and acceleration, but if all it can carry is chemical fuel, even if it can pull off that full 15,000-gee burn, it won’t be able to do that for even a second. 

We often see individual rocket fuels listed by their exhaust velocity or ISP, specific impulse, listed in seconds. Loosely speaking an ISP is how many seconds a rocket made almost entirely of fuel can accelerate at 1-gee, meaning if it burned everything up in a hundredth of a second it would be several meters of course, survive a shot, then get blown away by the next because it can’t maneuver anymore. Size helps too but you also need your missile a certain size for electronics and thrusters, and building smaller than a intercepting laser beams width doesn’t help either, small cross-section also helps, narrow and long, but they might get side shots at it too. 

Now your ‘missile’ is going to shatter into hundreds of smaller and harder to hit fragments right before it hits the confirmed kill envelope and is not aimed at the actual planet anyway. You are targeting all those orbital lasers with your first wave, so atmospheric entry isn’t as big an issue. You can’t kill those with lasers from way back at Earth or the moon because they can pull the same trick of jinking around only a lot easier. 

Your moon-side launcher is too big for that and it's very long and any major damage along the length of it is going to wreck it, at least till you can repair the damaged sections. 

Now this is an over simplified case, because not only can Mars field a ton of defensive satellites in low orbit, they can have them up in high orbits and they can also keep more mobile platforms along the path to Earth. They can also defend with big atomic bombs along the way too, not just lasers. Or normal bombs, it doesn’t take a very large piece of shrapnel to kill a relativistic missile and the corridor for them to travel down isn’t very high, the missiles can’t really sweep around in a wide arc. Unlike a normal spacecraft going to Mars, which doesn’t follow anything like a straight line, these are moving pretty close to straight and can’t deviate from that much. 

So by and large, Mars knows where the attack is coming from and can litter the path with defensive countermeasures to deal with the attack long before it gets to their home. 

This is an important point, one we’ll examine more in a bit, and indeed that is the Rule #1 of Warfare, always doing your fighting far from home, that way less of your stuff gets broken. A few questions have probably come up in your mind by now. What if we have a better drive system for our rockets? Genuinely compact high-efficiency fusion, or even anti-matter? What if we go for higher acceleration rates by making dumb munitions, just metal with no guidance package that higher accelerations would crush? Why aren’t they using lasers or particle beams on or near Earth to attack directly? And the answer is, you might, for all of the above. Each has their problems though. My goal today isn’t to tell us how these conflicts will happen, I have no idea, but rather to point out some of the options on the table and the flaws in some of the other known ones. Fusion, except as a bomb, is likely to always be rather slow, allowing high final speeds but not fast quick burns of thousands of gees. 

You could get around this partially by going the bomb route and firing warheads behind you to push you along with their explosions, but that’s unlikely to provide super-fast acceleration either and means sending a very large platform full of missiles that way, that fires them once you are up to speed and closer to the destination. 

Antimatter circumvents this, it is the ultimate rocket fuel, and make for great warheads even at relativistic speeds, but manufacture and storage of it is hard and dangerous, and that’s when you are just worried about regular storage in peacetime. Shoot a nuke or a fusion reactor and you kill it, it doesn’t explode. So someone can attack a munitions storage without causing huge amounts of damage. Shoot an anti-matter storage facility and it will all explode, releasing even more damage than when they would have a hit a target, since they will use a lot of that as fuel during the flight. You might be able to get around that by storing it far from anything of value, but more on that in a minute too. 

For particle beams, those are pretty dubious at long range, because they will start to spread out, and they are very susceptible to magnetic fields. The same for lasers, and both will have problems doing more than sheer heat damage to anything planetside when they arrive already diffused and then have to go through an atmosphere. They cannot maneuver in route, so placing anything along their path, which is exactly predictable, ends the threat. The same is true of big dumb bullets, except they travel slower. 

Now a planet is a big object but a planet-sized object, or collection of objects, does not have to be massive. Mars has a cross-section of 36 trillion square meters, a sheet of aluminum foil a tenth of a millimeter thick masses 27 grams per square meter, so it would weigh about a trillion kilograms. That’s hardly light but it’s miniscule compared to planets, we’ve discussed doing stuff like this to make solar mirrors or shades for terraforming purposes before. It might be rather hard to get a laser through a patch of space composed of thin balloons full of hydrogen that formed a bubble wall with the components shifting around. Scale can play tricks on the mind, but throwing one-ton missiles at relativistic speeds costs a ton of energy, as does powering some huge particle beam or laser, and defense like this could literally consist of tiny bullets composed inside of nothing but a compressed gas container and the thinnest foil you can make, so that when the container pops it expands into basically a soap bubble. Space is a vacuum, it takes very little gas to inflate something relatively large. Rather than point defense on a ship or space station that fires off conventional explosives it might fire these bubble bullets instead. They are also one of the handier ways to clear space debris from orbit. You could have guns that fired these bubble bullets into the right places to intercept something or fill holes in a bubble wall, call them bubblegums, pardon, bubble-guns. 

So at interplanetary ranges you want smart weapons moving as fast as you can get them, and they may even need to include their own countermeasures to jink around debris or clear a path the same way. Again you’d probably go with waves of volleys, thousands or millions of weapons coming in a reasonably tight pack, in terms of time not distance, you do want them spread out a bit, each wave following and tailored to the expected defenses. So the interplanetary war begins somewhere in the middle of the disputants rather than it just being empty space stuff goes through unimpeded. 

Now, as we mentioned you’ve got that narrow corridor between planets that attack can come from, but I also mentioned you don’t want to keep your antimatter anywhere near there if you’ve got it. More to the point, a big focus of this channel is on how solar system colonization isn’t just planets, and that indeed they’d tend to become increasingly smaller in terms of the portion of the system population they make up as time goes on. 

People are going to be building homes in asteroids, literally inside them, since excavating asteroids is easy and even if you are mining them intensively, that takes a long time and probably would not involve exporting everything, just the most valuable minerals refined down. Both Earth and Mars are surrounded by the Asteroid Belt which is wide, full of millions of decent sized objects, and spread out. The bigger ones probably host very large colonies and the smaller ones are great small outposts. One of these big mass driver missile launchers we discussed might be as long as a planet is wide but they are still thin and you could spool one up like a ball of yarn and pack it into a fairly small asteroid. Just so long as you can unwind and deploy it faster than the light from it can get to the target and back carrying an attack laser, it makes a handy missile launcher on an unexpected vector. 

You could also probably hide one on a cargo ship, and this is assuming you even feel the need to hide it and don’t just have big battleships carrying them around. You can also make such things single-use devices, a very flimsy launcher inflated by a nuclear explosion or series of nuclear explosion that also provides the push and power for the launch. 

Nukes are hard to tap for power, that’s why we don’t just use fusion bombs to run our own energy grid these days… and we could by the way, build a very large water tank big enough to handle an H-bomb blast and let the steam generated turn turbines, it’s just huge and H-bombs aren’t exactly cheap. But again, nukes are hard to tap for energy, and using the blast for one to power a mass driver or laser for a single shot is an option. 

That trick, if you can make it work, allows you to send missiles that get as close as they can then fire, shooting out gamma-ray laser or graser blasts or a relativistic slug out of some very thin and long mass-driver that is inflated by the blasts. 

Either way, when the conflict is no longer just two planets, but thousands of various colonies too, either provinces of one of those planets or independent city states or confederations, a lot of the dynamics change because you don’t just have one vector to defend against anymore. 

Personally I would not expect a united Earth versus a United Mars versus a United Asteroid Belt, but rather something like India and Australia, their Martian colony at Olympus Mons, and their fifty asteroid habitats going to war with say Egypt, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Indonesia and its Martian territory, and their various asteroid habitats over control of geostationary space above the Indian Ocean. We might see early colonization of the solar system done by groups of various nations working together, but once it gets decently cheap and routine, those colonies are generally going to emerge from one place and rely on that country for a lot of support, either as a territory, a state, or a sovereign ally. 

You might get folks on Mars feeling they have more in common with each other than their home countries, but in a place like the Asteroid belt, you are as far or further from most of each other than from Earth. And while we see shared oppression and grievances often given to asteroid miners as a reason to revolt, that is just fiction borrowing from history. Any sci fi setting where you hear about water shortages, or air recycling issues, either needs to qualify that with ‘not enough water to terraform this planet’ or it’s full of it. If you have spaceships operating under Newtonian physics, any single one of those big cargo haulers we see has a power plant capable of running a modern continent’s electric grid. They are not short of energy for recycling water and air. 

They are also probably not breaking their backs in mines somewhere, since first of all low gravity helps with that, and second, almost all the work is probably being done by robots anyway. But people being people, they are not likely to ever be short of grievances with their neighbors or homeworld, but it’s unlikely to be because the asteroid mining colonies have folks falling over dead from exhaustion, suffocation, dehydration, etc. More likely they’d be complaining about how country X was inflating or deflating the price of Titanium or something. In that sort of context, where you probably have lots of cultural and economic allies on the same planet the folks you dislike are from, and a lot more neutral third parties, hurling crust-buster nuclear ordinance at them is probably not on the table. Things get even worse in that regard as you progress toward a Dyson Sphere or Dyson Swarm, see that episode and the Kardashev Scale episode for more details on how those actually form and operate, but in short form you would tend to have billions or trillions of large rotating habitats, many physically connected to each other and a slew of ancillary facilities, all packed around the sun. 

Except they aren’t packed, because even though a completed Dyson Swarm is supposed to block out all the light from the Sun, it’s not so much a thin shell as a thick cloud or fog composed of many islands separated far apart, some by themselves, some forming into archipelagos that move together, but all moving relative to the other swarm members so that many people near you today aren’t next month. 

All the same weapons and defenses apply, but you can probably be way closer to deploy them just from the sheer amount of stuff helping you hide it. However you probably can’t shoot stuff as fast either because you do have billions or trillions of habitats involved most of whom, even nearby a conflict, have no skin in the game. At least not till some reckless ass fires and misses the target and splashes some previously neutral third party. 

That’s Rule #1 of Warfare, avoid helping your enemy recruit people. 

We often think of Dyson Swarms as jam-packed, they’re not, and composed of fairly flimsy structures, which they probably are not. Your typical rotating habitat is probably only a small portion of the overall habitat and is probably crammed inside some hardened non-rotating superstructure composed of meters thick armor of diamond hard thin tanks full of cheap hydrogen as filler. It’s probably got huge arrays of cheap thin solar panels around it to eat up munitions and backup fusion power to run on. It’s probably got most of its food grown in flimsy low-grav habitats nearby. It’s probably got the entire outside slathered in point-defense lasers and those bubbleguns and tons of outposts further away with the same. And it’s got all those neighbors, who will not appreciate megatons of diamond hard shards flying off into space - and at them - while you pound away at a habitat that isn’t so much a fragile egg or luxury cruise liner as a giant battleship with nice interior decorating. When you’ve got the kind of energy supplies and automation to be building these things cheap enough for folks to own suburban homes on them in the first place, bet on the architects and marketing guys including ‘and it’s got tons of armor and defense’ in the brochures along with how good the local schools are. 

Traditionally, countries tend to spend at least a percent of their economy on defense even in peacetimes, often a lot more, we’d like to think in the future we will be more peaceful, and I think we will, but it is worth remembering just how much ordinance 1% is in a post-scarcity civilization building these kind of things, and also that a post-scarcity civilization can get away with spending a higher percentage of their GDP on defense too. It’s also quite possible, that if you get inside one of these rotating habitats to invade it, you won’t be facing a regular old civilian population, since it is entirely possible a regular civilian in a high-tech civilization is a transhuman with light speed reflexes, centuries of skills, and a backup copy of their mind somewhere that gives them license to take risks. 

But we will discuss stuff like boarding actions, dropships, and orbital bombardments another time. We have no idea how war will be fought in the future, or if it will be more or less common than now. If it will be more civilized or tend to go for scorched earth strategies, indeed often you see the most no-holds-barred combat from civilizations that don’t fight much so conflicts might be rare but all-encompassing and brutal. Personally I think we won’t see many armed conflicts in the future, I certainly hope so, but while we had to do a lot of guesswork today we have hopefully painted a more realistic picture of what interplanetary conflicts would be like. We’ll look at interstellar ones another time too. Next week we’ll be visiting Venus, in our second installment of the Outward Bound Series, Colonizing Venus, and we’ll take a deeper look at Terraforming.

Fermi Paradox Great Filters: Rare Intelligence

Living in a technological civilization, it is rather hard to think of a bigger brain as a disadvantage, but as we’ll see today, that is often the case. 

So today we will be wrapping up our look at Great Filters of the Fermi Paradox, those conditions that are thought to act as major hurdles to technological civilizations arising in the Universe. 

Previously we’ve looked at those conditions for the planet that might make intelligence uncommon, but today we want to look more at the evolutionary steps to get to human level intelligence and also the hurdles you need to pass once you have that to get to true technology. 

Now for our purposes today, when I say intelligence I am principally referring to human level. 

We often use the terms sentience or sapience to further subdivide levels of intelligence, but the definition of sentience is terribly vague and can be interpreted to include pretty much anything with sensory apparatus and a basic brain, whereas sapience is not really in the common lexicon and essentially means wisdom. 

Since wisdom is trait often lacking in some humans, and also a trait not necessarily required for technology, I’m disinclined to use that either. 

So we’ll be sticking with human-level intelligence and I think context will make it fairly obvious when I mean any intelligence at all or human level. 

As always with the Fermi Paradox, since it is the question of why we can’t see or hear any aliens, it is also important to remember that at the moment that only means aliens with modern technology or better. 

Our brains are more or less identical to the folks who first figured out agriculture and metal working, but we could not detect such a civilization ourselves right now so if it turned out going beyond that point was very uncommon, you’ve got your answer to the Fermi Paradox right there. 

And it might be uncommon, we’ll spend the last section of the episode discussing that and challenging our general assumption that once you have tool and fire use and sufficient brains you inevitably transition to high technology. 

But before that, let’s consider some key steps of evolution needed to get to more or less modern man. 

There are quite a few of them, and even those which have happened more than once so that we cannot view them as a fluke, often took a lot of time, which is another key point of the Fermi Paradox. 

The Universe is young, and the period in which life could have plausibly existed is shorter than that. 

The odds of a given solar system having life should generally tend to increase with time too, except where changing conditions could make a planet uninhabitable, such as the sun it is around growing hotter over time and sterilizing it. 

A key aspect of the Great Filters approach of the Fermi Paradox is that it is not about if a planet might eventually support a technological civilization, it’s about whether or not they already do, and currently do, for a given value of current since light and signals takes a long time to travel. 

So as an example, over a long enough period of time, any given planet that had basically identical initial conditions as Earth ought to produce life, but we do not know what those conditions are or what the mechanism is, in any rigorous sense. 

If we assume it is underwater thermal vents, a planet with less of them should take longer on average to produce that first abiogenesis event. 

And yet we do not have a good fix on when life began on Earth. 

The most optimistic model is 4.28 billion years ago, while the oldest undisputed life is at 3.5 billion years. 

That is between 130 million years and a full billion years for life to arise after we had oceans, and for my part I have to raise an eyebrow at some people who refer to that time duration as ‘almost instantaneous’. 

We are also making a big assumption to think that is an average. 

That is justified by the mediocrity principle, which tells us that when we only have one example of something, or even just a few, we should assume that example is fairly normal. 

But that’s just a generalized approach to take in ignorance. 

If you land on an isolated island and the first person who greets you is wearing a hat and carrying a pair of binoculars, it’s a good idea to assume that is normal here until you meet other folks. 

Except that the binoculars probably are the reason that person was the first one to greet you. 

Nonetheless the Mediocrity Principle is usually a good first approach. 

Not, however, when you are dealing with a circumstance that has the word Paradox in it. 

We label stuff that way when the available evidence makes the situation seem impossible or freakishly improbable. 

At that point you want to challenge any circumstances where you haven’t got a lot of data and are making assumptions. 

We already know abiogenesis is improbable, horribly improbable, because the requisite chemicals and conditions existed in the trillions, interacting constantly, and still took a long time to go from that to alive. 

A man who wins the lottery on his tenth ticket, with no other data, thinks that is normal enough and will by the Mediocrity Principle assume most folks win after about that many, and if winning the lottery comes with having to go someplace to pick up the prize, most folks he meets there will be big outliers themselves too. 

It’s only when you actually know the number of winning and non-winning tickets that you truly understand the odds. 

Before that it’s just guessing. 

So the question is really just: “Is this abiogenesis event so freakishly improbable it takes countless quintillions of atoms a hundred million years to produce a basic lifeform, or just a bit more freakishly improbable so that it would normally take that sample a trillion years to cough up a lifeform but we lucked out early?” Up until the moment we can model the probabilities for a given solution producing a basic lifeform we can’t say, and there are probably many thousands of valid most basic life form configurations and a wide spectrum of specific environments they can emerge from. 

We haven’t got a clue if abiogenesis happens on short timelines in virtually any plausible chemical soup or was a one in a million event to have occurred here that fast and should be a great filter all on its own. 

I will categorize it as a possible Great Filter, but we will otherwise bypass it today. 

One other thing to keep in mind though, is that while we have a window for life to have emerged that’s about 800 million years wide, from 3.5 to 4.28 billion years ago, if life did arise on the early end of that, it means the next big steps took a lot longer, making them much better filters. 

Unicellular life, initially in the form of bacteria and archaea and later joined by the Eukaryotes, ruled alone over the Earth for billions of years before multicellular life came about 900 million years ago, but even that immense timespan does not do justice to the sheer generational scales involved. 

Some bacteria can multiply once every 20 minutes in ideal conditions, but let’s be conservative. 

Say they would have multiplied only once every 5 days. 

That is still 2 trillion generations to the dawn of multicellular life, which is comfortably more than the 1.5 trillion stars in our local group of galaxies! 

That doesn’t even count the number of actual organisms, only the number of generations. 

Mammals multiply considerably slower, in the order of months at the quickest and a decade or more at the slowest, and we have only had 320 million years since our early Synapsid ancestors began to multiply. 

Looking at generations alone, mammals are effectively nothing more than a blink of the eye when compared to the unicellular realm. 

We are dwarfed into obscurity when we further compare the sheer population sizes involved. 

So even though multi-cellular organisms appear to have evolved separately on many occasions - leading us to reasonably believe this is not a particularly improbable event - it’s worth remembering that still was less probable, in terms of raw generations and population, than every other mutation mammals have experienced combined. 

Some mutations did result in revolutions, even amongst the unicellular organisms, like the development of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria 2.1-2.7 billion years ago that ultimately changed our atmosphere to become Oxygen-rich. 

This provided a vaster energy source serving as the bottom of the food chain, and a much bigger total population. 

And that speeds up mutation by allowing more events. 

Another big one was being able to share mutations through viruses and plasmids allowing for the sharing and swapping of genetic material. 

When organisms can’t swap DNA then you can have billions of mutations going on but only in series. 

Another big step forward was sexual reproduction about 1.2 billion years ago, that sped things up too. 

In a way, we can think of that as when evolution really kicked into high gear: two critters of fairly similar DNA classified as the same species, rather than every organism simply self-dividing and diverging from those around it, and that took about 2 to 3 billion years. 

Had it taken even just 4 billion, our own Sun, which is constantly getting warmer, might have rendered the Earth increasingly barren and eventually uninhabitable before we arrived. 

So this entire sequence of events could be seen as a pretty strong filter too. 

Yet it doesn’t particularly interest us today either. 

Our focus is more on intelligence. 

That can be a fairly arbitrary term, and to make things worse we also have good reason to believe muscles, neurons, and even brains, for a given value of brain, have evolved separately more than once too, it’s not something limited to vertebrae. 

Indeed, since many plants demonstrably react to their environments, the only reason we can say plants won’t evolve brains is because they simply provide too much cost for too little benefit to them. 

That though, is a big thing to remember. 

Most tiny animals have way more generations than we do connecting them back to our common ancestor, and in that sense can be seen as more evolved. 

They reproduce faster and in larger numbers, both in terms of litter size and often total population. 

Your cat is more evolved than you are; indeed, chickens, rats, and rascally rabbits even more than they. 

Yet they’re not that smart and, very generally, the faster and more numerous a species reproduces, the dumber it is. 

You nod now, brains are big energy investments, take a long time to grow, and that is true and important, but at the moment think of it in the sense of catching up. 

Some species evolved a cool new trait that makes it breed slower and in fewer numbers, and all its rival species have a lot of room to narrow that gap. 

It’s been around a thousand human generations since our mutual ancestors started keeping cats and dogs around, but for them it’s been more like ten thousand generations. 

Add to that, we have been bootstrapping at least dog evolution during that time and often breeding for intelligence. 

Chimpanzees at least - one of our closest relatives and competitors for intelligence - do take a long time to reproduce, pretty parallel to humans, and again that comes from the long development time for brains, and most of the other critters that are demonstrably smarter than cats or dogs have generations much longer than a year too. 

That’s one of those first markers about intelligence, it is an expensive investment, not just to run a big brain, but to grow one in the first place. 

It takes a long time while the young critter in question is highly vulnerable and realistically cannot fend for itself. 

We can’t rule out that some alien might be human-level intelligent yet use the strategy of laying thousands of eggs and leaving them to fend for themselves, but it does seem quite unlikely. 

More important than that is recognizing that higher intelligence is not, as we usually think of it, automatically beneficial. 

Quite to the contrary, even ignoring the upkeep cost in growing and maintaining a big brain, it has some big disadvantages. 

I can toss you a ball and you can catch it; so can your dog. 

Whether you realize it or not, it took an insane amount of brainpower to pull that off. 

What we think of as the conscious mind is a tiny little iceberg tip poking out from a massive supercomputer below the surface. 

And in many ways it’s less of a peak than several, acting a lot like a committee. 

A basic reactionary brain is very helpful, it reacts fast and gets stuff done. 

Your conscious mind is more like a committee discussing everything. 

Picture someone feeling thirsty and grabbing a sip of water, versus some huge committee meeting to discuss water safety standards and a year later releasing a 300 page report. 

That big brain is wonderful for developing complex and abstract strategies, and thus science and technology and poetry. 

But it’s not great for dealing with a lion jumping out of the bushes to eat you. 

Simple fast action is typically the best, and a big brain that likes to stop and ponder stuff can get you killed - and in fact, it did get us killed a lot back in the day. 

We did not evolve as an apex predator and if you told just about anyone from pre-modern times that we should be worried about lions or wolves going extinct, that notion would be so bizarre to them they’d probably assume you meant to say we should be worried about it not happening fast enough. 

Now it would be silly to say, on a planet dominated by human technology, that bigger brains don’t help with survival, but there is a threshold, and probably a fairly narrow maze to navigate in evolving a brain capable of complex abstraction and problem solving without it becoming a survival hindrance. 

Tons of critters have big brains, most of them have had them for more generations than we’ve had our human or near-human level one, so either the next couple key steps requires a lot of improbable flukes or most of the time any improvement isn’t an actual improvement from a survival perspective. 

We still know so little about intelligence, human or animal, that it is impossible to call this transition zone an improbable one, but it is my own best guess for the biggest filter on going from animal to human intelligence. 

Relatively large brains have been around a long time, and in species that have had many generations, so simply getting a bigger brain itself is no problem. 

It’s getting one that doesn’t become a survival threat, and when you consider the sheer amount of resources we have to pour into a kid, or that chimps or dolphins or elephants do, compared to even a rat let alone an insect, we can see how that happens. 

High intelligence and conscious thought are often going to represent a fatal disadvantage to a creature and a species, not an advantage, and breeding slowly with huge inputs of resources didn’t advantage humans much until we had it for a long while. 

There are so many occasions in the last couple millions years where we barely clung on, rather than dominating the ecosystem as now, keep in mind most of the other folks in our genus aren’t around anymore, and there’s no consensus that we did any of them in, let alone every species of them. 

There’s a scifi novel by biologist Peter Watts called Blindsight that explores this in more detail. 

He makes some very strong arguments about how valuable intelligence and consciousness really are in there, and I strongly recommend it. 

I don’t want to spoil it, since it is also our SFIA August Book of the Month, sponsored by Audible, and is essentially a mystery so it’s hard to discuss without spoilers. 

But if you didn’t find my arguments about higher intelligence to be universally good or particularly compelling, I’m pretty sure his will do the job. 

It definitely shakes up the conventional view of intelligence and offers an interesting solution to the Fermi Paradox. 

Regardless, species have survival strategies, and the big brain route requires committing to a few: small litters, long upbringing time, long lives, and heavy interdependence. 

Lone wolf species are not well suited to benefit from giant brains, too likely to die before reaching maturity without protection, too hard to benefit from specialization when you need to be jack of all trades. 

But just because you’ve broken that barrier into a reasonably human-level brain doesn’t mean the job is complete. 

Once you’ve made that leap, something only we have really done, doesn’t mean the job is done. 

In the two or three million years we’ve been around, our crawl to technology has been abysmally slow till maybe the last 10 or 20,000 years. 

We got fire, very handy, but it took us a long time to apply that to making ceramics or metals. 

In all that time before then, we had it used it to stay warm, to keep predators away, to fire-sharpen sticks, and to cook meat. 

So imagine a species that had sharp claws, thick fur, was an apex predator, and could digest raw meat better than we can. 

Fire doesn’t help that much, and the stuff is terribly dangerous. 

They will probably never invent metals or ceramics because even if they do invent fire, it is a dangerous device of little value to them. 

We evolved during a series of ice ages when the planet was generally cooler than normal and we ourselves came from a warm part of it and don’t particularly have warm fur, even when we were hairier. 

Odds are pretty good that most species that get to the big brain zone don’t really need that, and that is the main reason you hang around by a fire for protracted periods and might ponder it and its other uses. 

We think fire was invented possibly as far back a two million years ago, but 600,000 years is the loose consensus for definite regular use. 

Definitive use for cooking only goes back 200,000 years, but it’s hard to say if that might not go back a lot further. 

Cooking food helped us digest it. 

We actually have an awful digestive track for an omnivore and we should assume that is abnormal. 

Digesting food you have already ingested and not maximizing what you can get out of it is a bit of weird oversight, possibly a very fortunate one for us though, since it not only meant we need fire to help with that, but it might have been a big factor in agriculture. 

More on that in a moment, but our crappy digestive system might have been very fortunate. 

So we already need a few unrelated mutations – longer lives, longer maturation, bigger brains, and a preference for tribes or clans – to be able to truly take advantage of high intelligence, and again the big point of evidence for it otherwise being disadvantageous is how many other critters have had decently large brains as long or longer than us, more generations evolve to catch up in the brain race, and still have not done so. 

It’s probably not that hard a mutation, just typically not handy. 

The octopus is an intelligent creature in that it is good at problem-solving and can learn and apply that knowledge. 

Recent genetic evidence says that their intelligence evolved around 400 million years ago. 

Why then are they not the dominant species having had such a long evolutionary head-start on us? 

Perhaps it comes down to them lacking those traits I mentioned. 

They are solitary, live in an ocean where fire is not an option and have short lives. 

Now we have the issue that most of our early technology just isn’t that handy, particularly if you don’t have hands. 

A lion doesn’t really need anything sharper than its claws for survival but would still benefit from being able to hit a deer at range with a sharp stick or get leverage by swinging an axe. 

But holding and swinging something is quite hard without the right anatomy and actually aiming to hit something at range with a stone or spear is much harder. 

It took us a very long time to make and improve such things, and if they weren’t as beneficial to us, even if they were somewhat beneficial, it probably would have taken longer and maybe never. 

Someone might invent a paperclip in the absence of paper, but it’s not exactly a device that will awe the tribe and get passed onto future generations. 

Our tribes were not that big, they couldn’t be, and couldn’t afford specializations or knowledge retention that didn’t help the tribe in an obvious way. 

We have found that a lot of critters do prefer cooked food over raw food, apes will usually pick a baked potato over a raw one for instance, when offered, so we don’t want to assume you have to gain a huge benefit from cooked food to do it, and it also helps you store food. 

Still, storing food is a pretty abstract concept, most critters don’t do it and the ones who do are not engaging in a learned behavior that involves conscious thought, so it’s not like a squirrel is going to think about cooking food to store it like he does nuts, and for that matter such critters usually store foods that last longer without being cooked. 

The other thing about fire of course is that it keeps predators away. 

Not all predators, and alien predators might be different. 

What’s more, alien planets are often not going to be well set up for fire. 

I don’t mean because they lack a decently dense oxygen atmosphere either, we covered that in the Rare Earth Hypothesis conditions last time. 

You need an environment where stuff can get dry, and a lot of planets might be way more humid or rain more often too, or have much faster plant decay. 

Decent odds are one of our ancestors was sitting on a nice soft bed of dry grass to be comfortable while relentlessly banging some rocks together to sharpen them and got fire that way, odds are also good they didn’t have an epiphany about its uses and this had to happen a tons of times before anyone thought to use it. 

Anyway, if you can make fires reasonably easily, you can probably also use them to keep at least some predators at bay. 

Which is handy if you have predators who eat you. 

It’s awful though if you are a big apex predator with great nocturnal senses. 

Predators tend to fall into two camps, ambush predators and pursuit predators. 

A spider is an ambush predator, it waits till something falls into its web. 

Cougars are usually ambush predators too. 

Humans are pursuit predators, we chase our prey, and we are a sub-type of it called a persistence hunter. 

Your cat is a pursuit predator too; it will stalk something then leap out and chase it if it tries to flee, but not for long. 

Humans keep chasing, we literally used to chase our prey till it got exhausted and then go kill it, that is how we could take out giant wooly mammoths. 

Something bigger than an elephant, which also travels in packs, and is not terribly afraid of sharp sticks. 

We’re also the only primate that does persistence hunting; we’re very good at it. 

Humans are excellent at long jogging for hours and we can get rid of heat fast, part of why we can both support a giant brain, which gives off a ton of heat, and benefit from fire to stay warm. 

We’d go startle a pack of animals and give chase, they’d usually outrun us, we’d catch up and scare them into running again, we can do this all day. 

We can make frightening noises, communicate over a large distance by speech, set fire to things to scare our prey more, and just keep jogging after them till one breaks a leg or literally runs itself to death. 

And yes, lots of animals can do that, they just keep going until they stroke out, humans don’t, we pace ourselves and can literally jog all day if in good shape. 

Of course dogs helped a lot too. 

Fire scares, but dogs warn. 

They were good at alerting us when some predator was nearby so it didn’t come in and eat us, and they are pursuit predators too. 

They’re good at finding smaller critters, an extra source food, at tracking critters, at scaring them away in the night, and also handy for both harassing animals we are chasing and transporting the carcasses. 

Yes we used dogs as one of our original beast of burden. 

It’s even hypothesized that since humans use eye contact followed by moving our gaze as one of our most basic silent communication tricks, and dogs are one of the few critters that understand that trick, that it could have helped a lot with our hunting. 

Animal domestication is rightly considered one of our big steps to civilization and that did start with dogs, presumably those brave enough to approach us, or let us approach, but not so aggressive as to attack. 

Keep in mind that’s fairly peculiar behavior too, a lot of animals don’t even like to come near their own species, let alone another they’re not planning to eat. 

Why did humans keep animals around and alive? 

How many other species who also shared our other characteristics would? 

Would we have gotten civilization without that? 

Now of course to get civilization we needed agriculture which means settling down in one place, cats were very handy then since they eat the vermin that were attracted to our food stores and garbage. 

It’s been suggested that a lot of the foods we ate, and to put it bluntly, did not entirely digest, grew in our waste, and we harvested these when we’d come back to a campsite the next year. 

It also has been suggested that thousands of years of gathering the things we got more food value out of selectively bred them to be easier to digest; a lot of those early cereal crops weren’t very easy to eat nor terribly nutritious. 

Of course we also have fire-stick farming, we are a bit of pyromaniac species and we used that for hunting, but we probably also noticed that when we torched a forest it tended to come back as savannah grass plains that a lot of grazing animals thrived better in. 

So some places we did forest gardening and others we torched the place and grew us grass-eating herbivores. 

Presumably at some point we figured out that we could cut out the middleman and eat some of those cereal grasses ourselves. 

Many uncertainties remain, but needless to say we eventually started hunting less in favor of keep our meat animals around and growing crops for them and us to eat. 

This allowed permanent settlements and more people, both of which are handy since the latter allows more specialization and the former means you don’t have to limit all your possessions to that which you can carry. 

I said early it took us a long time to go from fire to ceramics and metal working, but it is worth remembering that it is kind of hard to drag an anvil or kiln with you every day and the work you can do without those is fairly limited and inferior. 

So you get cities and specialists and eventually writing so that you can pass knowledge on to people who aren’t physically present at the time and don’t have to remember things our brains aren’t well designed for, like exact numbers of how many cows Bob brought into town last year and if he paid his taxes on them, which is probably what most early writing was interested in, not technology, personal journals or literature. 

At this stage we think of technology as fairly inevitable, people clearly can pass technology over great distances in both space and time, and also clearly know its value. 

Twinned to that, most talks of dark ages and lost technology are 90% malarkey, the European Dark Age is mostly a romantic myth made up during later periods and what little truth to it there is still ignores that chunk of the planet is not the entire planet or even a particularly large chunk of it. 

It has happened of course, there was some loss in the Dark Age and we’ve got examples like the Indus Valley Civilization that clearly got quite advanced, then just fell to pieces. 

Yet by and large useful technology doesn’t get lost, it gets lost because it isn’t useful to people who have it at the moment. 

Aqueducts didn’t get casually forgotten, they just aren’t that useful in a lot of places and circumstances, ditto giant buildings composed of arches are a bit of niche application. 

So we don’t want to assume civilizations can’t lose technology and that once you have it you become totally invested in improving it. 

Only maybe the last 10-20 billion humans alive, out of maybe 100 billion who ever lived, have been of the technology-addiction mindset, and even that is probably being generous. 

They knew technology was handy for all of human history at least, that being defined as the times and places we kept written records, which did not include most of the planet until relatively recently even compared to tiny period of 4 or 5,000 years we had it at all. 

Many of them just didn’t think on it much, they had what they had and no one was going around inventing new things constantly, but some outright rejected it. 

After Rome burned down, or one of the times anyway, the one Nero may or may not have caused, an engineer approached the Emperor Vespasian with some devices that would make transporting construction materials much cheaper. 

Vespasian – who mind you was generally considered one of the saner emperors – rejected it, saying he needed to feed his commoners. 

They needed work to eat. 

Now this is coming from a Roman Emperor, guys not generally noted for being concerned about the common people and also coming from one of the more engineering-oriented civilizations. 

In that light, we probably shouldn’t assume advanced technology was inevitable for humans, or that every civilization with the talent for it will pursue it to modern levels either. 

Similarly, the Fermi Paradox is not actually about detecting modern civilizations, but ones that have gotten advanced further than us. 

We would have problems detecting ourselves more than maybe 100 light years away, and could miss ourselves even closer. 

So we have to advance further ourselves and of course we might abandon that path our destroy ourselves first. 

If most alien civilizations destroy themselves at at our level of development, or shrug and say they have enough technology, or if they actually hit a brick wall on development, then there’s no Fermi Paradox. 

We would simply not see those civilizations when we peer through our telescopes at them unless they were right next door. 

Now I’ve discussed before all the doomsday options in one of the first episodes on the channel, Apocalypse How, and we may revisit them in more detail in the future, but we usually bypass any consideration that we would stop progressing technologically, if we were alive. 

None of us believe science is done yet, but there it a bit of an article of faith implied there. 

If I said we’d know all we could learn of science in another generation or two, everyone would laugh and I’d join them, but we want to avoid assuming there is always another mystery and that every answer brings two more questions, thinking that itself is a terribly unscientific viewpoint. 

We can hypothesize a time where we have learned everything, or hit a brick wall on the further development, and that could be inside the next couple of centuries. 

However, that doesn’t matter to the Fermi Paradox unless that knowledge includes learning some things we think are in reach really are not. 

No fusion power, no self-replicating machines or nanotechnology, no extending people’s lives or freezing them and waking them up. 

Fundamentally if you’ve got those, even just some of those, you can do interstellar travel and shoot for Kardashev 2 civilization status, and that does make the Fermi Paradox real. 

If not, if technology does hit a brick wall, there is no paradox. 

And I can say it, but I don’t believe it, so the Paradox is real for me. 

Now the last option there is that just about everyone gives up on advancing technology. 

That’s hard for me to accept too, and I think for most of my audience as well, for me, for us, the notion of turning away from the technological path is something so hideous that I can only regard it as essentially heresy. 

Unthinkable. 

Morally Bankrupt. 

Cowardly. 

Even Evil. 

It would be the most absolute rejection of so many of the ideals we hold as underlying everything our modern civilization stands for. 

And yet, when I think of folks worried about automation taking jobs, a concern I myself share, I do think of Emperor Vespasian rejecting a cheaper means of mechanical transport to feed his people instead. 

The obsolescence of occupations, such as took place during the industrial revolution, and is happening now with self-driving vehicles and general automation, can also lead to disenfranchisement of people, which has and probably will lead to pitchfork riots. 

If people associate technology with a negative, they can intentionally turn from it. 

There is also that other nagging background concern when we talk about automation too, that we might get automation so good it thinks for itself and is smarter than us, and either eliminates and replaces us or even if benevolent just reduces us to overfed happy useless pets. 

We’ll talk about artificial intelligence and such concerns more next month, but I could see a lot of civilizations looking at their level of technology, whose fundamental purpose is to make their lives better, safer, and more convenient, and just saying “Enough is enough, anything more sticks us too close to a precipice someone might push us over. 

I’d rather be inconvenienced than irrelevant or redundant”. 

I don’t see that happening often and have difficulty imagine it happens every time, that every civilization abandons technological advancement and does do before getting off their own home planet, but I think that argument probably does happen every time and pretty much has to happen at about this technological level. 

We shouldn’t rule that out; as it approaches, folks, even those who are otherwise very pro-technology, grow cooler and more hostile to further advancements and decide to stop short of Artificial Intelligence and any technologies that would make it too easy for someone to make one, or make a tailored virus or swarm of grey goo nanorobots or homemade nukes. 

I cannot see wiping oneself out as a Great Filter, with the sole exception of some sort of Suicide Pact technology that looks amazing, is easy to develop once noticed, and invariably kills everyone. 

I also can’t see artificial intelligence as any sort of filter, since it simply replaces a species, same as we replaced Neanderthal. 

But while I don’t find it likely, I could see intentionally shutting down further tech advancement as a possible last Great Filter. 

Again I don’t think so though. 

No, for my part, to summarize both this episode and the two before it, I tend to think we have an awful lot of hurdles and filters to getting where we are now, and that almost nobody ever has, and probably no one in this galaxy or its nearest neighbors, maybe even the whole supercluster. 

I think the filters are done and probably have been since we first started settling down into those first towns that became cities. 

I don’t think it was any one thing, but I tend to suspect the two big ones are the conditions for a planet to be plausibly able to support civilizations arising, and that final jump from smart ape to proto-human, and having it happen to a species that was improbably biologically configured to benefit most from basic technology, where many others would not. 

Those are the only two genuinely unique things we have, unless abiogenesis really does turn out to be a super-improbable fluke. 

A Planet with the right size and conditions and location in time and space to nurture massive biodiversity over very long times, and critters capable of genuine abstract thought in bodies and social structure very suited to benefit from it. 

We simply don’t know enough to say, and perhaps that’s part of the appeal to the Great Filter and Rare Earth approach for me, it is the camp I subscribe to, but while there are a lot of uncertainties and shaky reasoning, it doesn’t seem fatally flawed in any way, whereas pretty much every other solution I’ve ever heard tends to seem that way. 

We covered the rest of those in the Fermi Paradox Compendium and we’ll look at more of them in more detail down the road, and we will try to give them a fair shake, but to me the Great Filters seems the best candidate, and if does not to you, then I hope by now you can at least see why it appeals to a lot of us when contemplating this topic. 

Next week, we will be taking a look at interplanetary civilizations with follow up on the Space Warfare episode, Interplanetary warfare.

Outward Bound: Colonizing Mars
---
  
2017-08-17  
https://youtu.be/kmFOBoy2MZ8  

---

Life on Mars has captured our imagination for many generations and we have wondered what life would be like there even before H.G. Wells’ novel “The War of the Worlds”. 

So, today we will tackle that topic. 

We spent most of the Spring in the Upward Bound Series, looking at all the ways we might be able to get into space faster, cheaper, and safer than now. 

Once you get up there though the question becomes ‘what now?’. 

Now the usual answer is that you can colonize planets, and of course that is our focus for this series. 

Yet, it often seems like discussions of this spend most of their time talking about how to get there or some small colony of five or six people or maybe even a hundred or so. 

Which isn’t much of colony honestly, or they jump all the way to terraforming the planet with a population of millions or billions already. 

I do want to spend some time on that phase of things, but the middle ground often gets ignored. 

So we’ll discuss true terraforming but save a more detailed look at that for next month’s episode on Colonizing Venus. 

Similarly, we often talk about the role of robots in space travel and colonization, and it will likely play a big role in exploring and colonizing, but we’ll save a more detailed look at that for Colonizing Titan, after Venus. 

Connecting this episode to those two and others which may follow, we will look at concepts like trade for networking these places to each other and Earth. 

A colony, besides just serving as more living space for us, really needs to have some commodity it offers and others it needs. 

We always want any given colony to be as self-supporting as possible but at the same time, it does help to have trade to both optimize production and help keep everyone welded together. 

A common feature in discussions of extraterrestrial colonies is them breaking off, so you get Earth versus Mars, and we’ll talk about that notion a bit today and throughout the series. 

Now you don’t have to have seen any of the episodes on this channel to watch this one, but it is a bit of a sequel to the Upward Bound series and our previous discussions of Industrializing the Moon and Asteroid Mining are essentially part of this series too, so if you haven’t seen them yet, you may wish to watch them afterwards. 

In any event, we are not interested in how to get to Mars, or what the ships that transport people there are like, so we are going to jump to our colony already in progress. 

One or more of the systems discussed in the Upward Bound series are in place and we’ve got some orbital habitats around Earth and some serious resource extraction on the Moon. 

In orbit around the Moon we have Borman station, named for the commander of the first manned ship to orbit the moon back in 1968. 

We’ll assume the main base down on the Moon is Armstrong Base and the main hub close to Earth is Gagarin Station. 

We’ll be spending a fair amount of time on Borman Station in the series as our jumping off point to the solar system, so let me add that it is a rotating habitat simulating roughly Martian gravity. 

This was done for two reasons. 

First, it gives folks going back and forth from Earth and the Moon a mid-point of gravity to get used to the gravity at their destination; second, it lets us test the long term effects of Martian Gravity on people, as well as construction and equipment tolerances for Mars. 

A ship going straight from Earth or Gagarin Station to Mars might use a rotating section that began at Earth gravity and spun down to Martian normal, during the trip, but we will say most transit to Mars goes between Borman Station around the Moon to Mars. 

Leaving from the Moon to Mars has some advantages, but the one we are mostly interested in is that you can bring fuel and raw materials up from the Moon, and it’s lower gravity well, rather than Earth. 

Plus, starting a major base on the Moon let’s you prove it is viable before you start sending people far further away from potential help. 

Now we are going to assume we are not sending passenger ships to Mars at slow speeds, opting for more energy intensive approaches, but for a large bulk cargo shipments around the solar system you do probably want to use these most efficient approaches. 

These can take years however, so it’s great for moving bulk material around but not people. 

When our ship leaves Borman station, it will be carrying a few hundred new colonists on a trip of several weeks to Mars, which already has 3 principal settlements on it of a few thousand people each. 

This ship is the first of many planned ones now that a space elevator has been planned on Mars. 

This ship will be carrying it, and indeed it is going to become the new space station hub for Mars. 

As we’ve discussed before, it’s easier to build elevators on lower gravity planets, one on the Moon can be done with conventional materials for instance, Mars is harder but a good deal easier than Earth. 

We’ll leave it academic if anyone has managed to make an Elevator down to Earth and assume they have an Orbital Ring instead, but we will assume someone has made one strong enough for Mars and that it got manufactured down on the Moon. 

As mentioned, part of Borman Station’s purpose was to test if people could handle Martian Gravity in the long term, and it got started before the first Martian colonies did. 

We don’t know if 38% of normal gravity is something people can tolerate in the long term but for today we will assume the answer was yes, just with some supplementary medication and exercise. 

Should that turn out not to be true, I think Mars would be unlikely to ever become a genuine colony of Earth, or rather, you’d probably have a lot of rotating habitats around Mars that considered themselves Martian, but the planet itself would basically be a place folks spent time down on working there at mining facilities, not a home. 

Sort of a reverse of the concept of a classic coastal city, everybody lives on the land and many go to work in the sea, often for protracted periods, only here lots of people work on the planet but everyone lives in orbit. 

So for the last few decades since men first stepped foot on Mars they’ve been testing this notion and concluded that indeed, this gravity is sufficient and, unlike on the Moon, they don’t need to use mixed spin and normal gravity for folks on the surface, something we’ve discussed before, or cyborg people up. 

Healthy exercise and some supplements are enough. 

They’ve also got an orbital ring complete around Earth and a new production method for carbon nanotubes to allow for a decently strong and cheap space elevator that can handle Martian gravity. 

With this in mind, the drive to colonize Mars has grown, and it is also economical to go there for tourism, at least marginally economical. 

Most people couldn’t afford it and most who can don’t want to, but at least many thousands of folks can and do want to visit, so Borman station plans to start two-way trips there leaving monthly with a couple hundred people each, many of whom will remain as colonists. 

When this ship arrives though it is going to park in geostationary orbit, technically areostationary orbit since it is Mars not Earth, but we will use geostationary in our discussion of any orbit around any planet or moon that keeps hovering over the same spot. 

In our case, that will be 17,000 kilometers above Mars, closer than geostationary is for Earth. 

And they will hovering just over Pavonis Mons, a large mountain on Mars a good deal taller than Mount Everest and quite close to the equator, in the Tharsis Region. 

Humanity’s first Martian base was near there and is typically just called Pavonis. 

We will name the ship turning space station Port Tharsis. 

The other two settlements are close by, a ways northwest at Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain in the solar system, and the other in Valles Marineris, to the southeast, one of the largest and longest canyon systems in the solar system. 

Now by default you want to have a space elevator right over the equator, and indeed we will place Port Tharsis right over the Martian Equator, but as we discussed in the Space Elevators Episode, you can connect multiple tethers to the same space station that connect elsewhere than the equator, balancing out their forces, much like guy wires on a tower, so long as at least one of those connects to the north and south hemispheres each. 

So while a single space elevator just south of Pavonis is an option, we will instead be dropping three tethers down, then moving their ends to connect to the top of Olympus Mons, to Pavonis, and to Marineris canyon settlements. 

So they have three, which provides plenty of redundancy and gives us direct access to space and vice-versa. 

This is handy because while Pavonis is the oldest and biggest settlement, a lot of folks at Olympus and Marineris prefer to keep their settlements independent, and until recently Pavonis was the nominal planetary capital. 

There’s been quite a lot of arguing about that recently. 

The original Mars colony was under the United Nations and since it can often take an hour for a message to get to Earth and back with a reply, the security council has a commander there who oversees things and is at Pavonis. 

With all the new colonists arriving folks have been discussing something a little more permanent and democrat and independent. 

Back when it’s just a few hundred people this was fairly laughable; they needed to phone home for everything and everyone was a specially trained and vetted expert at something. 

This is changing. 

As we step out of the first landing car arriving at Pavonis down that elevator, they are proudly celebrating their first café being opened, and as we look around at our other fellow travelers, we are reminded of their own backgrounds. 

Having spent many weeks traveling with them, we know them well enough and most are not experts. 

This is no longer a mission where the best and brightest can be selected and screened for stability. 

One of our companions is the new magistrate who is supposed to be replacing the former magistrate who dealt with minor misdemeanors but there were very few of those and never any felonies, so he spent most of his time helping people with legal documents dealing with issues back home. 

Divorces, trusts, wills, etc. 

In a colony of several thousand it is a rare day at least someone hasn’t had a family member back on Earth die or had some sort of issue involving a relative. 

Mars, the planet named for the God of War however, has just had its first big fight, a barroom brawl off at Olympus over independence, and instead of replacing the magistrate, who will be remaining in Pavonis, he is heading off to be the magistrate at Olympus. 

The original colonists didn’t have a lot of folks with legal or law enforcements backgrounds among them, there’s a lot of things they need to have, and at the same time they have more than enough specialists from a lot of fields. 

All of that is going to have to change as they transition from being an outpost to a permanent colony. 

But what about Pavonis? 

What is this settlement like? 

As a new colonist looking around, we do see domes and quite a few, but not as many as we’d expect for a town of a few thousand. 

But beyond those the view, while breathtaking, is quite barren. 

Most of the settlement is in caves and lavatubes in and around the giant mountain. 

Those domes are just for hydroponics. 

Going inside, it seems a bit dreary even, and we find ourselves wondering what the appeal is to come to Mars. 

Oh sure, the first few thousand folks who came here did so for the simple motivation of coming here. 

People go to Mount Everest or Antarctica just to go there, but precious few decide to live there. 

In the short term that’s not too big a problem, even if only 1% of 1% of Earth’s population wanted to come to Mars that would still be a million people, far more than the current population, and of course once there they’ll have children themselves and doubtless there will always be more people wanting to come to. 

And yet, what is the appeal? 

What drove colonization on Earth? 

It’s very unlikely many folks would be sent to Mars as prisoners, as with Australia, or to flee religious persecution as was the case with many American colonies. 

There’s no luxury crops like sugar or tobacco to grow in plantations on Mars. 

Mars has plenty of iron, but so does Earth and the Moon. 

It is a breathtaking place to vacation, low gravity with mountains that dwarf anything on Earth and vast canyon systems too, and that’s something since some folks might visit, subsidizing the colony, and decide to stay too. 

Its major export right now is curiosity, prestige, and wonder, which keeps the money flowing from Earth, for now, but Earth doesn’t particularly need anything Mars has. 

Folks sitting around the new Pavonis Café discussing the future of Mars try to think of stuff, but they mostly can only see things Mars can import or export to other planets, and right now the only other planet besides Mars and Earth with any people on it is Venus which has a small scientific outpost floating in its atmosphere. 

There are also a few experimental mining operations in the asteroid belt and various robot probes poking around the planets and moons of the outer solar system. 

Trade, they think, has to wait on the rest of the solar system getting settled, and they worry there might be a catch-22 in there, since the motivation to settle all the places seems to revolve around other places already being settled too. 

Of course they talk about terraforming Mars one day too, not just living inside mountains and lava tubes and domes, and some say that it isn’t even something far ahead in time, but never, that there is no advantage or purpose to trying to give Mars its own atmosphere and oceans. 

That they should keep on just making new domes with air inside them and basically turn the giant mountain they live in into one big arcology, essentially a giant mountain hollowed out into a skyscraper. 

The folks over at Marineris feel a bit differently though, and that’s where we are bound. 

We could, of course, take the elevator back up to Port Tharsis and back down to Marineris, but instead we will be taking a ground vehicle. 

The lack of any serious atmosphere makes flight on Mars very difficult, but it also means high-speed rail is cheaper since there’s not much air drag to fight. 

That’s going to be a while because while it would be very handy, building a few thousand kilometers of track between Olympus, Pavonis, and Marineris won’t be easy. 

In some ways it is easier than on Earth, low gravity makes bridges over chasms cheaper, and you can get away with much sharper inclines up and down craters and hills, but you’ve only got a population of thousands, not millions, and you have to use a lot larger percentage of your population for just basic food and life support here too. 

Oxygen is plentiful enough, but it all has to be liberated from water or baked out of rock. 

Nitrogen for plants is hard to find, and every acre or hectare of crops you want to grow needs a dome over it first, or artificial lighting if done underground in a lavatube or cave. 

You can’t plant your crops in raw Martian dirt either, it has to be done hydroponically or in soil made by taking that dirt and processing it in huge vats full of microbes and algae first. 

The notion of transforming Mars into an Earth-like planet is daunting to say the least. 

It’s not worth doing, says the driver, going on about how at Marineris they’ve decided the future is in robust para-terraforming. 

That’s where you just slowly cover an entire planet over in domes, to keep the air in and the local soil out. 

Glass above, concrete below, and you just add dirt you’ve made into them. 

They plan to eventually dome over the entire Valles Marineris cavern system. 

The drive there is slow going, part of why they want that rail system, because there’s no gas station on Mars and no air for them to use to burn that gas anyway. 

Everything is electric and battery operated. 

They don’t really have the manpower for building rail or power lines yet and Earth said no to shipping those in. 

What they’re really hoping for back at Pavonis though is one of those new fusion reactors from back on Earth. 

They’re big, heavy, and getting one to Mars would be a problem; but once here, they don’t need above ground domes anymore. 

They could do all their growing in vast lavatubes and caverns that wouldn’t need sunlight then. 

Valles Marineris is stunning in scope. 

It’s not that it is 4000 kilometers long, it’s that it is 7 kilometers deep and at its widest, over 200 kilometers. 

It’s almost incomprehensible, even in low gravity, to imagine a single bridge spanning that, let alone a dome. 

Fortunately our real destination is Noctis Labyrinthus, a series of maze-like smaller chasms on the western edge of Valles Marineris closest to Pavonis Mons. 

It begins just a few hundred kilometers southeast of Pavonis and its many smaller, narrower chasms are filled with an icy fog. 

This pilot project for terraforming has selected one of the narrower, shorter, and shallower canyons, and they are busy walling up the end so they can dome the whole thing over and pump in water from the ice in the area to make the first lake on Mars. 

It’s stunning to take in the scope of this dome, just a few kilometers long and wide, and you are already wondering about cracks or meteor strikes on it and how they plan to deal with them, let alone how they plan to build titanic ones across the wider parts of the main Valles Marineris chasms. 

As we settle in we start seeing four distinct viewpoints among the colonists. 

Here in Marineris, the interest is all in domes: endless domes to eventually cover the whole planet. 

And the focus is on how to manufacture them and repair them and harden them against cracks and meteor strikes. 

Grids of radar and lasers to shoot down incoming meteors, possibly tall curtain walls around the edges to help minimize erosion damage to the domes from dust storms. 

Individual smaller domes connected with airlocks or great big ones with graphene supports and liquid patches that could be rapidly sprayed on any crack or hole. 

They envision not so much a Green Mars as a Greenhouse Mars: a ‘worldhouse’ as it is sometimes called. 

They point out that it is far easier to get all the nitrogen and oxygen they need for atmosphere, when it is only maybe a hundred meters high, not kilometers. 

If you want to have normal air pressure just from gravity alone, with no ceiling or walls, you need to have a lot of air piled on top of air. 

On Earth, every square inch of surface has 14 pounds of air over it, stretching many miles, or 10,000 kilograms per square meter. 

On Mars, because of the lower gravity, you actually need more air per unit of area, to have normal air pressure. 

That means your atmosphere has to go up higher. 

On Earth, at the top of Mount Everest, it’s fairly hard to breathe as the air has thinned out a lot by that height, and the pressure dropped. 

If we could transport Olympus Mons back to Earth, at 22 kilometers in height, the air density wouldn’t even be a tenth of what we are used to. 

Conveniently on Mars, since the atmosphere would have to stretch up higher, you might still be able to breath all the way at the peak of Olympus Mons, and still be able to down at the bottom of those chasms, where pressure would keep rising, though odds are they’d all be full of water anyway. 

That’s what the folks at Olympus Mons want, the second philosophical camp for Mars. 

They want to terraform the whole planet, so you can walk around anywhere without a spacesuit around you or a glass dome above you. 

We’re curious about them, though the folks at Marineris say they’re all blue sky dreamers and more than a bit batty, but we decide to visit them anyway. 

To do so we first have to go back to Pavonis, and meet with folks from the other two camps. 

One of them is simply the pessimism camp. 

They think this whole idea was a mistake and they shouldn’t have come here at all. 

They are going home when the next colony ship arrives, there’s always plenty of space on those for a return trip, and they’re irritated the most recent ship became Port Tharsis instead. 

They’re basically loitering around Pavonis sowing pessimism. 

They’re still pro-space expansion, they did come here in the first place after all, but they’re thinking planets and moons besides Earth are for robots to live on, and people should stick to arcologies on Earth or perhaps rotating habitats in orbit. 

That’s our fourth camp too basically. 

They like the idea of having settlements down here on Mars but they think, now that there’s easy access back to orbit with the elevators up to Port Tharsis, that they can have just a few settlements planetside but do most of their living up in orbital habitats, like all the ones being built around Earth these days, and settlements here should be mostly about comfort for the folks who need to be down here overseeing mining. 

Yes robots would be handy but they still need a lot of oversight and a lot of times it’s just easier to use a person. 

But they want nice, contained, truly Earth-like habitats and they figure all their other industry and agriculture can be done on those in orbit. 

There’s no need to dome over the whole planet, let alone terraform it. 

Just a few places here and there for mineral extraction, ice mining, and for the tourists to visit of course. 

Indeed, better to leave the planet mostly as-is. 

They figure no tourist is going to want to visit domes; they want to see the natural terrain. 

They’re all for a few of these projects, doming over a few chasms, having a few lavatube habitats underground or in the mountain caverns, but they’d rather see Martian settlement mostly happen in orbit. 

They are somewhat open to the notion of terraforming Mars centuries down the road, but the way they see it, they first need to get their industries built up and have exports. 

This way, they can eventually pay for the huge amounts of nitrogen, and probably water too, they’d need to bring in from other planets or comets. 

So we set out on the much longer trek to Olympus Mons, and the last stretch is rather grueling because they have set themselves up all over the mountain including the peak, and we do want to see Mars from the peak of the tallest mountain in the solar system. 

It is no surprise that there is a bar up there and it is the one the fight broke out at earlier when we first arrived. 

We run into our friend, the magistrate there, and share a drink. 

He informs us that this is not the home of the second philosophical camp, the folks that want to terraform Mars completely, but rather three camps who argue with each other a lot. 

One group does want to terraform Mars, while the other group wants to bioform people and plants on Mars. 

And indeed, that’s split into two subgroups as well. 

One wants to set up an ecology where everything can live on native Mars dirt and not as thick an atmosphere, less nitrogen than Earth too, but thicker than now. 

Plants genetically engineered to use the native soil. 

People engineered to live on thinner air and better adapted to the local gravity. 

The other group wants to go completely native: organisms tailored from the ground up to live on Mars as-is; people cyborged up to walk around without spacesuits, who don’t need to breathe and are safe from radiation concerns too. 

Why, they say, should we put all the effort into making this planet livable to humans and earth life, or even meet halfway in the middle, if we can just make new life that can live here? 

The magistrate seems to have been converted. 

There’s so many problems with terraforming he says. 

The planet has virtually no air but when the duststorms come they are like a nuclear winter, blackening the sky for days or even weeks at a time, so solar power can be unreliable and plants need supplemental lighting. 

If you get oceans and moisture in there, that would stop; but suddenly exposing the planet to lots of water is likely to result in huge flash floods and tsunamis of mud, with no plants and roots to hold them down. 

It will never have enough gravity to be like Earth, even if we dropped every asteroid in the belt and every moon around Jupiter on Mars, we still wouldn’t increase the gravity that much, and it would be kind of wasteful. 

But even ignoring the gravity, we’d need to bring in air from elsewhere. 

Sure there’s enough oxygen, oxygen is plentiful pretty much everywhere in the solar system. 

But not nitrogen. 

The only abundant supplies for that besides Earth are Venus, Titan, and of course the Sun itself. 

But good luck lifting that nitrogen off of a star. 

He points out that it isn’t like moving a few colonists; we’re talking about moving atmospheres and those are pretty heavy. 

Earth’s atmosphere is 5 billion megatons, mostly nitrogen, and when we think of big ships, even huge oil tankers, a single megaton is about as much cargo as they could carry. 

If one arrived carrying a megaton of nitrogen every day, it would take 100 million years to bring in enough nitrogen, and without a magnetosphere on Mars, it would probably evaporate away before we finished. 

No one wants to wait a hundred million years, so that means you’ve got megaton tanker ships arriving not every day but at least thousands of times a day, or ships far larger. 

And until near the end, there’s not much use to that existing atmosphere, part way through you can start adding water and possibly some tailored plants to get some basic ecological cycles going. 

During that whole time, inhabiting the planet still means living inside domes or caverns and you’d have to worry about those being destroyed in the geological chaos of a planet gaining oceans and atmosphere. 

To keep that atmosphere there, we’ll also need to ring the planet in satellites, sucking in solar power to run electromagnets and create an artificial magnetosphere. 

Mars is cold and far from the sun too, so you probably need to be considering orbital mirrors to bring in some more light. 

Those are both fairly hard tasks, though both are dwarfed by the task of bringing in all that nitrogen and probably water too. 

This is not a terraforming episode, we did one of those before and will look at such concepts again in the next episode on Venus, but it is always good to remember that terraforming a planet fundamentally alters it. 

It’s not the existing one just turning blue and green, all but the biggest landmarks are going to cease to exist as sea rises and land slides under torrential storms. 

No, this episode is about colonizing Mars and we see a handful of paths for doing that. 

There’s the terraforming route, make the place as much like Earth as you can, and as we discussed in that terraforming episode you have tons of options depending on how far you are willing to go, up to and include adding mass to a planet or changing its day length or even moving the thing to be closer or further from a star. 

If you’ve got the will to do it, and the resources, you can terraform Mars to whatever degree you see fit. 

But it requires orders of magnitude more effort to do that than some of our other options, it’s less finding a cave to live in then building an entire mountain on a plain so you can drill a cave into it. 

Possible but probably not ideal. 

Bioforming is an option, but again it comes down to how far you are willing to go, just in a different direction. 

You might be able to limit yourself to fairly minimal tweaks to plants, animals, and people, and meet halfway in-between, terraforming part way too, but once you open the door to that path, there is the question as to why not walk down it further? 

And how far is too far? 

And since the path for meeting in the middle still takes many centuries at least, isn’t that likely to end up as a sliding standard as people move the milestones on what is acceptable? 

If you are modifying people to the point that they can breathe easily in very thin air, why not in no air? 

And why not just go the full cyborg route and not need food or air? 

In that context why do you even need planets, except maybe for raw materials, and maybe why even a body at all, in favor of a digital existence in a virtual landscape of your choosing, on any planet including surreal landscapes which are not physically possible? 

And that is an option too. 

So is the option of making Martian mean folks who live around Mars, and some who just go down to work the mines or visit the place. 

The slow disassembly of the planet to construct rotating habitats, built as needed. 

I don’t know which is best, I guess that will be for the Martians themselves to decide down the road. 

If I had to guess though I would wager on a little of all of the above. 

There’s a mistake in thinking for instance that you actually have to terraform an entire planet or not at all. 

As an example, the mountains, Pavonis and Olympus Mons, sit in the middle of volcanic caldera, and when you think of things like caldera or craters you often think of a bit of bowl with a rim around it. 

There’s nothing stopping you from extending that straight up, like the Great Wall of China encircling a place only 10 or 20 kilometers high. 

That sounds like an insane project, but it really is no different then doming over such an area or manufacturing a rotating habitat. 

You could then fill just that area with air and water, some would leak out, but just to the rest of the planet, so you could build one that was decently small to begin with, fill it with air and water, and just keep adding more to it, localized terraforming that also slowly terraforms other areas if you want. 

A similar concept is building up your atmosphere by doming over areas and just filling them with new air and not worrying about what gets lost to leakage. 

You don’t necessarily need a full Earth Atmosphere on the planet either. 

People can survive for short periods in much lower pressure than Earth’s, and some organisms might do just fine in it even without modification, and it doesn’t take too much air to give you a shield against most meteors. 

People might get used to wearing masks when they go all the way outside, which might not be too common if they just need to repair leaks. 

Indeed since those various crack and spots near the leaks will be in between the local native environment and the artificial one, it’s not a bad place to experiment with limited bioforming, the methods where you meet halfway in the middle. 

Heck, there is even a chance we might find some simple life on Mars, unlikely but we can’t rule it out yet. 

That of course raises the issue of whether or not it is okay to colonize a planet that already has life on it, and if so, do simple microbes count? 

But also, if we did find life there, it might be very valuable. 

Odds are there are a lot more marginal planets like Mars out there in the galaxy than Earth, and being able to use those, or some modified version of them, to help in early terraforming might make them very valuable indeed. 

I don’t know what the future of Mars holds, but if I had to guess, if we checked back on our colony in the year 3000, I would expect a little of everything. 

Yes some Great Walls of Mars encircling some place that was genuinely terraformed. 

Yes giant domes over chasms, with protection from meteors and self-sealing capabilities. 

Yes smaller domes, yes big underground cities or hollow mountains artificially lit by fusion power. 

Yes some people who have modified themselves to live in the natural Martian environment, or to meet it halfway in between. 

And yes, a swarm of rotating habitats above, where people live and grow food and manufacture materials for export and handle imports of giant ships carrying water and air. 

Each one generating a magnetic field for its own protection and to act in concert as a shield for the planet below. 

Indeed each with its own defense grid to shoot down meteors that might hit them or the planet, and orbital mirrors that bring in more light. 

They might eventually have to choose to terraform all the way or not, to bioform or not, or even to disassemble the planet for materials or not. 

But for a very long time they could choose not to occupy somewhere in the middle but the whole spectrum of options, if and until they decide which is best. 

And as I often say when it comes to colonies, it’s not just that we nowadays don’t know for sure which options are best, what with having never done it, but it isn’t our decision anyway, it’s for the folks who live there to decide, and they have centuries to make that decision and they can change it down the road. 

They may be so removed from us by then that they don’t want to be much like Earth. 

We’ll discuss making planets more Earth-like by terraforming more in our episode on Colonizing Venus next month, but next week we will be returning to Earth and following up on the Rare Earth Hypothesis notions that Earth-like planets are incredibly rare by asking if intelligence, especially human level intelligence, might be quite uncommon to develop even on Earth-like planets, in our close out episode of the Fermi Paradox Great Filters series, Rare Intelligence.

Quiet Revolution: Technologies that will change the World
---
  
2017-08-10  
https://youtu.be/jvH-7XX6pkk  

---

Many technologies show up with loud proclamations of how they will change our lives, while others arrive more quietly, but just as surely revolutionize the way we live. 

Two men wake up at 7 in the morning on August 10th. 

The difference is one wakes up in the year 2017 and the other wakes up in 1717. 

The latter wakes up chilly, to the sound of a rooster crowing, from a bed of straw he shares with lots of bedbugs. 

Neither his night shirt nor his bedding is terribly clean, and he splashes water on his face from a bowl to help wake up before looking outside to try to guess what the weather will be like today. 

He, like all of his family and most people he knows, is a farmer, so the weather matters a lot to him, and any other news will be a long time coming, including that his brother, who lives just a couple towns away, broke his leg a few days back and passed away from an infection. 

He works from sun up to sundown because he has little machinery and he would probably work longer if he had access to something better than candles to provide light. 

Our other man wakes up in 2017 to the sound of an alarm clock, he is not hot or cold because his home has central heating. 

His pajamas and bedding are quite clean because he has a washer and dryer. 

He is a bit groggy because he can light his home at the flick of a switch so often stays up later than he should. 

Fortunately he has hot coffee and a hot shower to help him wake up, and he checks his email while drinking that coffee and listening to the news and weather. 

He already knows his brother broke his leg a few days back, even though he lives a long distance away, and of course he does not die from an infection, he’s just at home bored and probably would welcome a phone call. 

These are two very different lives. 

They are separated by three centuries, a dozen generations, and a slew of inventions both major and minor. 

Those inventions, major and minor, have altered our civilization profoundly during that time. 

Our topic for today however is not those inventions, but rather the ones emerging nowadays that will change our lives once more, many of which get little notice in the news. 

Even those emerging technologies that get reported with much pomp and hype often bypass a lot of the simple yet drastic changes they will bring to how we go about our normal day. 

This was a topic picked by a poll of the channels supporters on Patreon and it’s a great topic, but one that’s surprisingly hard to discuss. 

A survey of technologies that don’t get talked about a lot, but will change the world we live in, requires introducing those technologies and explaining the potential of each. 

The trick is that technologies that don’t get a lot of fanfare don’t get it because their value and applications are not too obvious. 

Fundamentally, technology is about making our lives better, safer, and more convenient. 

To talk about the impact technology will have on our lives we need to go deeper than just what the technology does, like how a fusion reactor makes electricity cheaper and renewable, an obvious benefit, but also how it alters our day to day life. 

Cheaper electricity is awesome, an energy source that doesn’t run out or cause environmental problems is awesome, but it is easy to overlook all the other benefits that come along with them. 

We once devoted an entire episode to just that one technology back in the early days of the channel. 

Today we need to cover several such technologies. 

So to do this we will walk through a day in the life of two people, Sam, who lives nowadays in the year 2017, and Hannah, who lives just a few generations from now in 2077. 

Sam wakes up, hits snooze on the alarm clock, then wakes up again five minutes later and grumbles as he gets out of bed. 

He gets the coffee maker started, then heads into the bathroom to shower, shave, and brush his teeth. 

Unlike most of his ancestors, he has all of his teeth, though some are fillings or caps. 

He drinks coffee and has a bowl of cereal, checks the news, dresses, and plots out his day. 

So Sam gets in his car, and unlike his grandfather, he can remotely start the car before heading out so the vehicle is all warmed up when he gets in. 

He stops for gas before getting on the freeway, and spends maybe five minutes pumping it. 

He doesn’t need to speak to anyone though, it is 2017 not 1987, so he just slips his debit card into the machine rather than going inside to wait in line for a cashier. 

He doesn’t need to grab another coffee either, because large thermos cups are cheap and easily available. 

When he gets back in the car he has a phone message from his boss saying not to come to the office, everyone is going to a meeting hall and here is the address. 

Sam’s company makes software and he’s going to go demo that software this morning to a company in the area. 

He’s got it on his laptop and keeps a projector in the trunk, they’ll tweak the usual presentation and email it to him with some notes on the prospective customer. 

He doesn’t recognize the address, but that is what GPS is for. 

So he gets on the road and almost rear ends someone while trying to read those notes, but arrives at his destination and gives the presentation; thankfully they seem happy with the product. 

He doesn’t know the area well, but searches the internet for a good restaurant for lunch; then heads back to the office, gives his boss a report on how it went, and they spend some time strategizing how to close the deal. 

It’s been a bit of a stressful day, so he goes and gets a drink after work, just one though because he needs to drive. 

He then goes to the grocery store and thankfully he remembered to put his list on his phone so he doesn’t forget anything. 

He heads home, microwaves some dinner, and settles in to watch some TV and play a video game to finish unwinding. 

His son Ted calls from college and they chat for awhile, and then Sam heads off to bed. 

That was a day in the life of Sam. 

Sam’s day is a fairly normal one for modern times, different from a generation ago in many ways but similar in many others. 

Different from the one his son Ted will live, but likely similar in many ways too. 

It is worth noting that while Sam has access to virtually all the knowledge of humanity, he can’t particularly learn it faster than someone with access to a classic library could. 

He, and his son away at school, can access just about any information near instantaneously, but other than it being easier to find visual examples beyond text and a diagram, how he intakes new information hasn’t changed much over previous generations, even if his mode of access has. 

Okay, 60 years later, Hannah wakes up, but she is not groggy so doesn’t hit the snooze button on her alarm clock because she doesn’t actually have one. 

Unlike her grandfather Sam, or her dad Ted, she does not own a smartphone either. 

She has a supercomputer in her wristwatch, and some thin contact lenses, and tiny implanted speaker by her ear that feed her information instead. 

Lots of her friends have no wristwatch or contact lenses either, just stuff wired into their brains more directly, but she’s a bit of traditionalist. 

She’s not groggy because every day she eats a couple of capsules, the same way we might take a multivitamin or allergy medicine. 

They are gel-capsules that dissolve into lots of tiny pills which in turn can be sent a signal to release their contents or simply let them pass through the system unused. 

Some of those micro-pills contain things like melatonin to help her get to sleep or others to help her wake up. 

There’s no alarm clock on the nightstand next to her bed, instead, a little while before she wakes up, those medications get triggered to help her transition comfortably to wakefulness and her ear-speaker starts talking or playing music. 

The lights in the room turn on too, and grow brighter. 

She doesn’t start the coffeemaker, because all the smart electronic shadows that follow her around made a good guess she’d want some, and some toast, and delivered those to her nightstand instead. 

She doesn’t brush her teeth in favor putting in something like a mouth guard that she just bites down on and it goes to work brushing and flossing in a very precise and guided way, then relays that data to her dentist’s computer, which analyzes and collates it to see if she needs an appointment. 

She knows what cavities and fillings are, because she heard about them in a history class along with smallpox. 

Normally, Hannah would not actually go into work, because she mostly works from home. 

She does need to go in sometimes though, so she does find it worth the cost to have a car rather than just summon an automated taxi. 

She tells her vehicle to start while getting dressed, and feels a little chilly as she steps outside, but her clothing is smart too, with lots of small machinery and micro-sized solar panels and batteries and wireless energy receivers in it, so it instantly starts warming her up on her walk to the car, which is short because it drives itself up to her doorstep and opens the door for her. 

She tells it to take her to work, and she sips some coffee, and reviews her notes and correspondence while it drives. 

She works through lunch and orders whatever she likes for drone delivery, she doesn’t even know who she ordered it from, or that it came from 2 different places that seamlessly coordinated their delivery to be simultaneous. 

After work she goes to a pub and decides to stick around for a second drink because she isn’t driving and she does not need to go to the grocery store. 

She just gets a note from her smart house requesting permission to buy things she’s low on and asking if she wants anything else. 

She scans the list, adds some ice cream to it, and says yes, all the while chatting with a random stranger at the bar. 

Neither of them ever gave their names, since they are just used to seeing someone’s name pop up in their vision whenever they look at a person’s face and their various electronic shadows detect the mental equivalent of curiosity. 

She heads home and talks to her dad Ted along the way, he appears to be sitting in the car with her, with every sight and sound seeming to come from someone physically there, though her preferences are set to always give a certain halo and translucency to such folks so she doesn’t forget they aren’t actually present. 

He’s entirely digital though, her dad Ted is not there and not sitting, and from his perspective his daughter is walking alongside him while plays golf half a planet away. 

He remembers when the software for this was a lot less seamless, and would show a video window of their face, and when you used to have to remember to take your phone with you and had to mess around trying to get charging cables into the ports. 

He hasn’t plugged anything in for a long time, and Hannah doesn’t even remember doing so, because for her whole life everything has just been wireless. 

Energy is transmitted to small devices by magnetic induction, or runs off stored energy in tiny, high energy density batteries that charge very quickly, and gets power off micro-sized solar panels in one’s clothing or by leaching a little energy off every swing of the arm or leg. 

She doesn’t think about it much but often it’s a little harder for her to move an arm or leg when her electronics shadows think she needs some exercise and divert that extra energy into the grid, or rent some of the processors in her clothes or bracelet out for cloud processing, signal boosting, and so on. 

Hannah works for the same software firm her father and grandfather did, but she never carries any equipment around for presentations, because she rarely does them in person, and when she does, she can just grab the files off the cloud and share them right to her audience, and the interface is so smooth and mostly thought or gesture controlled that she can shuffle through dozens of charts or images in real time and send them, or even make new ones as needed. 

Indeed her audience can usually alter the parameters of a given chart without even having to ask her, they just say they want the chart they’re seeing projected over 5 years not 3, as she showed them, and it does. 

When she gets home she has dinner with her son, who is off at college, but is actually in the house in the flesh right now, because he just attends lectures by watching them and he asks his professor questions by calling during office hours, which are all day every day, because dozens of professors around the planet nominally teach that course, and his study group for doing homework is likewise spread all over the planet. 

An individual course might be taught by many different people, and he just finds the lecturer whose style he prefers and watches those, but it’s not live, so he needs someone else to ask questions. 

Hannah doesn’t ask him about his grades because he doesn’t get them, he finishes a class when he knows the material, be it a day or two years, and he never takes tests either because the folks who designed the course also designed tens of thousands of questions or other progress monitors, and those just get injected from time to time in the course. 

When he’s nailing them 9 times out of 10 it moves on to more advanced stuff, or tells him he has proficiency and that gets recorded in his file. 

Hannah does not need a second mortgage on her house to pay for his tuition and lodging, because paying a couple dozen different professors to prepare an instructional segment on a topic everyone around the planet can pick and choose from is a lot cheaper and more cost and time effective than paying one professor to stand in a room repeating the same lecture once a semester to students that may or may not be receptive to his presentation style, or have to miss a class and fall behind. 

There is no class to fall behind on, just subjects, and the ability to assess with solid accuracy how knowledgeable an individual person is at any time on that subject. 

So Hannah doesn’t have much trouble falling asleep because she isn’t too stressed out by life, and her personal health monitor can send a signal to some of the pills left in her system to dissolve or tell her how much of something to take if she needs a hand getting to sleep. 

What’s interesting about Sam and Hannah’s lives is that they both live in a pretty automated and high tech civilization. 

We spend a lot of time on this channel talking about futures in Hannah’s Era or even centuries further ahead, and we tend to focus on big things. 

New spaceships, new energy sources, giant constructs we could build around our own star or other stars and the ships that will get you there. 

Not today though, for today it does not matter that Ted was actually playing golf in a rotating habitat orbiting the Earth, complaining about how the spin throws off his normal swing. 

We care that his golf partner was actually lying down at home on his bed playing with him in virtual reality, and that he, Ted, and Hannah were thousands of kilometers apart, but all felt like they were in the same environment chatting, even though they were not in the same place and quite possibly all saw different environments. 

We don’t care that they have rocket ships with big fusion powered drives that can get to Mars in a week, we care about them having cars they can sleep in, fully relaxed in the knowledge that it could drive through a blizzard without a risk of accident and that if one did somehow happen, a dozen safety systems would pop on deploying airbags and restraints before the vehicle even hit the target, and that if somehow even that wasn’t enough, an automated ambulance would be on the scene in moments with robots controlled by experts hundreds of kilometers away piloting them, and already knowing from the vehicle monitors exactly what happened and where all the injuries were and how severe. 

We also don’t particularly care that Hannah’s son can do classes online, we already have ever-improving technology allowing that. 

We care about the automated interactive aspects of that, something called Affective Computing, or computers and systems that can recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human body language and affects. 

Fundamentally it is this sort of technology that holds the strongest potential to revolutionize our lives. 

Sure, a student can watch a recorded lecture and pick from several variations of it by other people covering that same topic, just as you can do now on YouTube for instance. 

But it is a bigger gamechanger when the system can actually recognize that you are confused or distracted and act accordingly, by simply bringing up a different or expanded presentation. 

One that can recognize what sort of voice tones and manner or accent you respond better to and suggest speakers based on that. 

It can even real-time alter theirs. 

Or even perform text-to-speech functions that don’t pronounce each word mechanically, but can simulate it like a normal person would say it, and possibly even produce a simulated speaker who doesn’t trip all your mental flags as inhuman and disturbing. 

The Uncanny Valley, our tendency to respond more negatively to things which seem closer to human than further away, is a big hurdle to making such simulations, but if you can get past it, you open the door for books that don’t just get read aloud by some cold disjointed voice, but can be real-time performed like a TV show or interactive virtual environment without needing actors. 

It’s a lot easier to learn the history of the world when instead of a book or lecture or even historical TV drama, a person can land in that environment where the bits they find boring can be seamlessly detected and altered, so they remain focused on the important knowledge while enjoying themselves. 

It’s nice to have a test that doesn’t need to have questions checking your reading comprehension, because it already knows what that was from monitoring you while you read, and even nicer if most text can adapt as you’re reading it to rephrase the information or the question to better communicate to you as an individual. 

It’s like the automatic translator that doesn’t just hear what someone said in another language and translate it word for word, but instead can convert all the idioms and expressions into another language and its own idioms and expressions. 

It will be even cooler if one day we can just download knowledge and skills into your head, like in the film the Matrix where they upload for a few seconds and suddenly that person knows martial arts. 

In the absence of that, while we can only use our eyes and ears to input data, which are limited to their format and bandwidth, being able to maximize those by tailoring the input to the individual could massively boost how well and quickly people acquire knowledge and skills. 

Nothing would more powerfully alter our day-to-day life than the ability to absorb skills and knowledge quicker than we do now. 

Even many of our conveniences come from simply making a task so easy you don’t have to invest any time into learning it. 

A civilization where everyone is a jack-of-all-trades, and an expert at a few, is fundamentally different from ours. 

We didn’t focus on cool new power production methods like fusion today, we focused on ways to conveniently get power. 

Wireless energy transmission by magnetic induction or energy beaming, smaller and better batteries and solar panels, or harvesting energy right from the person. 

Leaching just a little energy away from every motion, maybe even putting devices in the body that could steal a bit of energy from your own food to transmit it to devices in or on you. 

I never really said how Hannah’s car operates, that it is an electric vehicle ultimately powered by some big fusion reactor somewhere, because Hannah doesn’t think about it. 

She knows the batteries in her vehicle replaced a combustion engine when batteries finally got small enough and fast charging enough to remove the inconvenience of recharging compared to refueling. 

But she just doesn’t think about it anymore than you or I spend much time thinking about our light bulbs or light switches, or what makes our refrigerator cold, even though those devices changed our lives profoundly. 

We’re not too interested in the super-powerful classic or quantum computer that could simultaneously play every human being at chess and beat them all, or even the social media network that can help you find other people in your area that enjoy chess. 

We’re interested in the hardware and software that notices you like playing chess, and can let you know the person you are talking to does as well, and likes gardening like you do, but does not share your joy of cooking, or parachuting off kilometer tall buildings. 

Predicting the future of technology is always a hit and miss game, often in hindsight the stuff is obvious, but can’t be predicted in advance, something we call a Black Swan, and have discussed before. 

Some technology and its impact is easy enough to predict, but what makes them inaccurate in most cases is all those tiny secondary advantages and changes and those tend to focus on human desire and convenience. 

It’s not that hard to predict faster computers, the internet, satellites, or cell phones. 

What’s hard to predict is people using those to post a picture of what they ate for lunch. 

Once you do, you can imagine that a lot of restaurants will advertise online and show photos of the menu. 

It will seem obvious in hindsight that someone is going to make a piece of software that can look at that image and make some smart guesses about its nutritional value and calorie count. 

It will seem obvious in hindsight that as we get more Affective Computing able to monitor your reactions, your computer will get better at showing you bits of stuff on your social media newsfeed that you’ll enjoy, and that advertisers will be able to hit you with an ad showing a picture of pizza with the toppings you like when you are just getting a little hungry and haven’t had pizza recently, and tomorrow you’ll get shown sandwiches instead. 

It’s predictable that 3D printers, and fast, cheap, delivery might put a dent in classic retail shopping. 

It’s predictable that automated vehicles, not needing expensive drivers, will make it much cheaper to deliver things or take a taxi, so that fewer people might own individual vehicles. 

It’s less predictable that these might start including a casual chat function that notices two strangers sharing a vehicle are uncomfortable and bored and can drop an icebreaker so they can talk to each other. 

It’s less predictable that some software company will make a fortune designing algorithms for that which can seamlessly drop a targeted advertisement in there where the automated driver can say that it noticed you’re hungry and like Italian food, and there’s a great bistro just up ahead. 

Automated vehicles, wireless energy transmission, affective computing that can read your moods or even mental implants that can sync directly to your thoughts are all technologies that are emerging and do tend to get a fair amount of attention in the media. 

However, it is very easy for us miss a lot of those secondary applications that can quietly sneak in there to revolutionize our lives just as much as landing on the Moon did, or going to Mars will. 

Next week we will be starting up a new series looking at just that. 

We spent a lot of time recently in the Upward Bound Series discussing how to get off the planet, and in the new Outward Bound series, we’ll be visiting some other planets and moons and talking about how to get there and what to do when you arrive, and we’ll start with Colonizing Mars.

Hidden Aliens

The problem with trying to hide your civilization from others is that usually by the time you think to do that, it is already too late. 

So today we return to the Alien Civilizations series to take a look at the concept of Hidden Civilizations. 

Vast ancient extraterrestrial empires that lurk about the galaxy quietly or confine themselves to small regions of space, possibly even just their original home planet. 

We might as well stick two qualifiers on this before we go further. 

We are not talking today about alien civilizations that hide among us, nor about relatively new civilizations that try to keep their heads down. 

For the latter, a new civilization on the galactic stage has good cause to tread softly in the early stages. 

It’s almost certainly wasted effort, as we’ll see, but prudence still seems to suggest keeping quiet in new and unknown environments rather than stomping around with a megaphone asking if anyone is there. 

No, our focus today is on civilizations that are committed to staying hidden over the long term -- not just being cautiously quiet while they are new, or apathetically quiet because they don’t care to talk with others. 

We are going to discuss some of the reasons why you might want to do this, some of the reasons it might not work, and some of the ways you might be able to hide yourselves if you have certain technologies normally limited to fiction or speculative science. 

Let's start with possible motivations. 

Why would a civilization hide? 

For instance, a species that just wants to keep to themselves because they’re xenophobic, but not especially hostile or fearful, has a different scope of possible actions than one that is afraid of being invaded. 

As I mentioned in a previous episode, if you want to keep visitors away, hiding is often not your best solution under known physics. 

In the absence of FTL, Faster than Light Travel, a spaceship can take centuries to get to its destination, and it is most likely a one way trip, especially if they can’t refuel when they arrive. 

Telling a decelerating spaceship just approaching your solar system to go away amounts to signing their death warrant… or possibly yours. 

The species living there might not care, but the rest of the hypothetical galactic community is going to be asking why those guys didn’t put up a simple beacon saying ‘stay away, this is our solar system, no visitors’. 

Some of those folks, especially the civilization that ship came from, might decide to go ask in person. 

Having an alien armada show up on your doorstep pissed off because you either killed their people by negligence or shot at them when they decided to try refueling is not a good way to avoid interacting with alien species. 

Plus, ‘no trespassing’ beacons are pretty cheap, particularly considering you can safely bet no species that lacks FTL travel ever sends ships anywhere without pointing telescopes there first, so you don’t need to be transmitting very loudly. 

The sheer cost of time and resources for interstellar travel tends to encourage you to do your homework. 

And to keep doing it too. 

Either the ship has telescopes of its own pointed at the destination as it cruises along, or it is getting periodic updates from the ones back home at light speed. 

Telescopes, like transmitters, cost a lot less money than spaceships. 

Now obviously if you’re hiding, sticking up big signs saying ‘go away, no visitors’ is not the best approach. 

Our example here, however, is of a civilization that isn’t afraid of an unprovoked invasion, they’re just xenophobic. 

A species that evolves to have technology does need to have some traits like curiosity and social behavior, but that doesn’t mean they like things besides themselves. 

I tend to think extreme xenophobia toward other species is not too common with technological civilizations, but we can’t assume xenophobia is uncommon among aliens either. 

What I do see being common is a fear of predators and a desire to hide. 

Humans are very afraid of predators sneaking in at night and eating us. 

Little kids frightened of shadows or boogeymen under their bed are not being irrational, they are obeying a very old and reasonable fear of being eaten. 

That’s a real threat even to apex predators when they’re young, so a desire to hide from predators is probably almost as universal in alien civilizations as curiosity is. 

One of the reasons hidden civilizations keeping quiet tends to resonate so well with people when discussing the Fermi Paradox is probably just that. 

Fiction is overflowing with examples of evil predatory aliens sneaking out of the darkness to eat us, and it works as a story device because even though humans are about the most dangerous thing on this planet, we are still hardwired to fear the wolves. 

A lot of seemingly irrational behavior in humans derives from what is essentially legacy software and hardware issues. 

Figure on those being common in aliens too. 

Behaviors rooted in biological imperatives which made sense originally, but are a bit hit and miss for decision-making in modern contexts. 

A given alien might be more likely to want to hide than we are or less, but since impulse control is one of those things that comes hand in hand with a brain powerful enough to develop logic, reason, and technology, we can assume that aliens only try to hide their civilizations when it is at least vaguely reasonable to do so. 

Now, that’s our first problem, if you assume the galaxy is full of predatory aliens hiding in the dark reaches of outer space, you do not want to hide from them on your home planet. 

They are unlikely to be afraid to visit sunlit planets and to know that’s the easiest place to find prey. 

Consider the growing list of exoplanets, accumulated at a time when we can barely put simple telescopes in space, and then try to imagine the kind of telescopes any species with basic interstellar travel might have. 

Forget about radio signals by the way, that’s not a great search method even when you’re confined to a planet. 

Nothing you need to hide from will be planetbound and they have better options. 

Any species that hunts other civilizations by waiting for them to discover radio and TV is too stupid to be a threat. 

We can broadcast all we want without concern because first off, it’s already too late since we’ve been broadcasting for a century, and secondly, anybody who can come here and hurt us never needed that to find us and already knew about us. 

The probable presence of life on Earth is detectable by any number of other telltales that can be seen at a distance, we were betrayed by our own atmosphere a billion years before life crawled onto land. 

No, if you want to hide, you don’t do it on your home planet. 

You also probably don’t want to bother hiding your civilization anyway, just some piece of it as a backup. 

We’ll discuss possible ways to hide in a bit. 

Before that, let us walk through two scenarios. 

For the first, we will be the predatory species folks should hide from, having shown up first on the galactic stage, and in the second we’ll be a species contemplating ways of hiding from them. 

So here we are, an evil interstellar empire that arose a billion years ago. 

How do we operate? 

First, we need to assume we don’t really colonize much ourselves, it’s obviously very easy to keep alien civilizations from arising if you just colonize every planet in a galaxy, something that won’t take you more than a million years if you’ve got the ability to do interstellar travel in any sort of plausible way, and much faster if you have access to FTL travel. 

Second, even a modestly expansive species is going to have at least close to K2 civilization numbers and resources, meaning they haven’t got any problems deploying a telescope to watch every single planet constantly and throwing together fleets of billions of ships. 

Check out the Kardashev Scale or Dyson Sphere episodes to get some idea of the scale of these kind of civilizations. 

Third, we have to assume that for some reason travel to other galaxies is off the table, otherwise while your predator species is lurking around the Milky Way Galaxy rather than colonizing it, some Kardashev 3 civilization will arise next door in Andromeda and decide to come pay a visit, and they will crush you. 

Those are some fairly dubious assumptions, and if any of them aren’t in play this isn’t going to happen. 

The biggest issue against you is time itself, because while any Kardashev 2 civilization - that’s one that’s just maximized their own solar system, not any others -- could easily send a big battleship or even a fleet to every solar system in the galaxy to monitor it for life, there’s no guarantee they are going to do that. 

Let say we send a fleet to go watch planet X for signs of emerging intelligence and attack if they see any. 

They get there ten thousand years later and set up shop to wait, because they see land life has just emerged. 

Let’s consider this situation for a minute. 

Even assuming we’ve got life extension or had these guys on ice for the trip, once they arrive the game has changed. 

They, or their descendants, have a long time to sit on their ships twiddling their thumbs. 

How many generations before they decide to just colonize the planet? 

Or say screw it and nuke the planet instead of waiting for intelligent life to emerge? 

Or fall in love with the critters on that planet and decide to protect them? 

How long before they become aliens themselves, breeding in isolation for tens of millions of years? 

You might need to send another extermination fleet to go deal with them, and since they will be expecting it, best build another fleet to handle the ones they, and all the other fleets you built, will be sending your way. 

It’s hard for me to imagine humans opting to do the galaxy-wide perpetual extermination thing, and we’ve been known to try to kill off other humans who are genetically just a few thousand years removed from us. 

If we assume the kind of extreme xenophobia that would make you try to keep purging a galaxy for a billion years, how likely are they to be cool with mutant branches of their own species who aren’t just a hundred generations removed, but a hundred thousand? 

While it is darkly amusing to imagine a galaxy with a million empires, all descended from the same planet originally, trying to wipe each other out, don’t assume other species could safely emerge during that conflict. 

They would still be monitoring everything and still be just as enthusiastically genocidal as before; so they’d still know if some new species emerged and would be able to divert a small fleet there to nuke them… or use whatever other method of extermination might be in vogue. 

Genocide really does need to be done in person though, unless you are willing to go all-in and kill every planet in a galaxy that might spawn life, a K2 civilization could do that from home using the weapons platforms we discussed in Nicoll-Dyson Beams. 

They just sterilize every planet once a galactic orbit. 

Now if you are really worried about mutation from colonization, you probably need to go the machine route, preferably the dumb machine route. 

We have discussed von Neumann Probes before, self-replicating machines that reach a nearby solar system, grab some raw materials, build some more probes, send those to new systems, rinse and repeat. 

This is a good approach because you can slow down mutation in self-replicating machines and make sure everyone has the same priorities. 

Unsurprisingly, it is one used in fiction a lot, usually as the evil artificial intelligence who just wants to kill any organic life. 

Lots of good books on that notion, including my own favorite series, Alastair Reynold’s “Revelation Space”. 

I’ve mentioned those before in other episodes so I’ll instead recommend a newer book by Dennis E. Taylor, “We are Legion, We are Bob”, which is a lot more light-hearted than when we usually see this technology portrayed in fiction. 

A key point in that novel and its sequel is that even making copies of the minds can result in very large and quick divergence in behavior, and that is going to be hard to avoid in any truly sentient mind. 

The ability to think up new solutions and analyze abstract problems pretty much guarantees that those copies will diverge from each other over time and new experiences, and if their philosophies and motives change you’ve got a problem. 

So stupid is probably a better way to go, guided interstellar missiles that just have enough intelligence to do targeting and maybe maintenance. 

Either delivering an explosive strike or something more biologically-targeted and clever like the proto-molecule we see in the Expanse series, TV or novels. 

It could possibly be some very simple self-replicator that has a lot of the mutations safety controls on copying, “error checking algorithms” or some other options that we discussed in the self-replicating machines episode and a very limited mission. 

Keep it simple, go to place, scan for basic signs of life, find a rock, replicate, destroy life, send mission data home, send replicators on to neighboring systems. 

It could be dangerous giving it any real brains or free will, and even then, leaving a swarm of these things meandering around the galaxy probably isn’t a good idea. 

You could have them hard-wired to automatically shut down and hibernate, only waking every so often to scan their particular area, but you might just be better off sending out new batches of them periodically instead. 

When sending out specialized weapons designed for killing off intelligent life, it pays to be paranoid in your safety precautions. 

So in that context, it’s kind of hard to imagine anyone doing this. 

It’s so much easier to exterminate potential alien civilizations by simply colonizing their planets in the first place. 

If you don’t want to colonize but still want to eliminate even the possibility of life evolving and posing a challenge, it is better to send your probes there looking for signs of life period, not just intelligence. 

Or even just removing all the planets life could arise on, mining away all the elements and sending them home. 

Now, let’s move on to case two -- folks who are thinking about hiding their civilization. 

They are going to have all the concepts we just discussed available to them too, and I think they’d conclude what we just did. 

If there were predators out killing intelligent species they’d have already been killed. 

Anybody who has the willpower and skill to maintain a galaxy-wide, billion year long extermination process is going to be very, very good at it. 

They won’t make rookie mistakes, and they might be monstrous villains, but this isn’t Hollywood so the villains aren’t going to be dumb. 

If I can think of a dozen ways to kill off all life in a galaxy, they can too, and probably more, and if you asked me which method to use, I’d say all of them. 

You don’t nuke someone’s planet, you nerve gas it, virus-bomb it, then nuke the place, and when you’re sure you’ve got everyone, you still send hazmat teams down to look. 

Then you disassemble the planet as raw materials to build more armadas. 

So we can conclude nobody is out there planning on killing us that we need to hide from. 

Either they don’t exist, or they don’t want to kill us, or they just plain suck at genocide. 

It seems to me, most species would draw these same conclusions. 

What’s more, even if they conclude they should hide in case everyone else is doing it -- hence the quiet galaxy -- they are going to wonder why everyone is hiding since the logic is flimsy enough that at least a few species will decide not to. 

Let’s assume they do hide, and they spend thousands of years hiding and improving their technology. 

Someone will raise this issue again and say “Why don’t we build a probe, send it to a distant solar system, and have it set up shop there and broadcast a message? 

That way, even if there is something to be afraid of the transmitter won’t reveal us. 

Heck, we can even put a small observation post nearby to send a discrete laser signal home so we can monitor if someone comes and investigates the probe.” Now the immediate follow up to that is going to be someone asking why no one has already done this, other species would have thought of it too and someone will have tried it and concluded no aliens or no hostile ones and proceeded to move around more openly. 

How many millions of years are you going to hide before you finally say nuts and abandon the effort? 

Especially since the first ones to do so have the advantage in settling the galaxy, building their numbers up, and being safe from any previously quiet civilizations that may have more recently become a threat. 

After all, a species that hid for fear of being exterminated might not be such nice guys themselves. 

They might be so afraid of being killed off because they think it’s the logical thing to do and would like to do it themselves to others. 

That is worth considering too since the ethically proper thing to do if hiding would seem to be to launch a few probes to get safely far from your civilization and then transmit warnings to others to hide. 

So it’s not a good Fermi Paradox solution, because it seems very unlikely everyone would conclude hiding was best, particularly if anyone else was already openly moving around. 

But just because it doesn’t work for the Fermi Paradox doesn’t mean nobody would do it. 

There’s a lot of reasons why some species might decide they want to hide, and again you don’t need to hide everything. 

I mean if I have been hiding my civilization for a few centuries, I might want to keep some of it hidden in reserve, to be on the safe side. 

Just as we can send a probe far away to do its ‘Hello, is anyone there?’ transmission, we could also send off a very quiet colony ship somewhere to act as a backup. 

So how do we hide a civilization if we want to? 

That last part about the quiet colony ship gives us our first point to explore. 

Wherever you hide should not be your home planet. 

Too obvious, too hard to hide. 

As we’ve discussed before, there is no stealth in space. 

Planets are hard to hide and so are spaceships. 

Similarly, you don’t need to hide your civilization, you need to hide your backup. 

That could be a few thousand folks for a stable gene pool and copies of your records, but a high-tech civilization doesn’t necessarily need a few thousand people because they can use a few, and a lot of frozen embryos. 

And one decently more advanced can probably store a digital copy of all their genetic information for every organism in their biosphere too. 

And one just a little more advanced could store digital copies of all their citizens too. 

Indeed, in a transhuman civilization odds are a lot of folks will have copies of their minds as a backup anyway, and likely many of them with a few rather discreetly tucked away. 

I usually assume one bit of storage for one atom, we can’t do quite that well yet but we’re close. 

And there’s options that might permit folks to do even better. 

It’s not really necessary though since at that density of storage you can squeeze a billion gigabytes of data onto a nanogram of storage and that’s enough for a human memory, likely many times over again. 

That’s whole metropolises worth of people on a grain of sand or the genetic information for whole ecosystems. 

A few weeks back, in the episode Civilizations at the End of Time, we talked about keeping whole simulated universes in your pocket. 

That was an extreme case, but keeping a whole civilizations backup memories in your pocket isn’t. 

Our digital memory is bigger than that right now in the interest of fast and cheap memory, they might have the same interest too, and you might need to go bigger than the atomic scale for storage, but at the atomic scale you’d have no problem storing every human mind, all of our art and literature and history, and all the genetic information to replicate Earth, on something that would fit in your pocket. 

However, we’ll be conservative and assume that with some additional protective equipment and casings, you might end up with a big cube weighing a ton and about a meter wide. 

That’s a little inconvenient, but considering it’s storing an entire civilization we won’t complain that it requires a forklift to move due to all the shielding and various redundancies. 

Ya know, built to last, because it’s hard to get an insurance policy or warranty for the high-tech equivalent of Noah’s Ark. 

Where do you hide it? 

Well first off you don’t hide ‘it’, you hide ‘them’, as it’s not likely to be something so resource intensive that you can’t make many of them. 

Regardless, where is an optimal place to hide it? 

And at the same time, where do you hide an actual existing biological civilization? 

Again, not on your home planet. 

We assume malevolent and genocidal civilizations are very committed and good at their job, so odds are reducing your homeworld to atomic dust is going to be on their task list and they’ve probably had whole blue ribbon committees and think tanks devoted to designing ways to track down and exterminate any survivors. 

If you’ve got force fields like we discussed last week, sticking your archive inside a star is a decent approach, or even your whole civilization, since you don’t need to worry about your energy output being detectable. 

Even pretty advanced and determined civilizations have to work hard for a long time to kill a sun. 

It’s also kind of hard to hunt around for a needle in that haystack. 

Ducking down inside a very large black hole might be a good option too, though getting out of either of those is a dubious proposition at best. 

But the more realistic approach is not anywhere inside your solar system or even any solar system. 

In between the stars there is a vast amount of empty space. 

Only it isn’t empty, there’s all sorts of cold small objects out there, very hard to see even if you know what to look for, and incredibly numerous. 

They’re hard to see because they are small and cold, and the reason why spaceships are easy to see is all the energy they give off while speeding up or slowing down. 

They can also be seen by the heat they give off just maintaining their environment inside. 

That’s a lot harder and shorter range though. 

Now nothing can be completely hidden, but the less energy it gives off, the harder it is to see. 

You could detect a colony hidden in a comet because the comet will be warmer than it should be, but there is a range of uncertainty about how much it should give off. 

Some kilometer-wide ball of rock and ice in the interstellar void is soaking up some starlight, cosmic microwave background radiation, and other types of cosmic background radiation. 

There’s more than microwaves incidentally, and it probably has some radioisotopes in its composition slowly decaying and giving off heat. 

There’s some variation in all of that which makes it difficult to calculate how much some blob of interstellar flotsam should be giving off naturally. 

That allows you a decent amount of power you can produce while still staying safely within those margins of error for detection. 

What’s more, you could pick a rock that had a fair amount of radioisotopes, one from a spot near a recent supernova that’s got lots of fresh uranium and such, and just remove those materials. 

You can scoop out all those radioisotopes so your own power generation can replace it or just harvest and use them instead. 

Now searching all of those possible hidey-holes is a pretty Herculean task, but we are talking about a species willing to search a whole galaxy for life so you might assume they’d do it. 

But as strange as it sounds, searching a whole galaxy for life-bearing planets is a lot easier than searching even a fairly small volume of interstellar space for a small habitat hidden inside a comet. 

It’s the difference between searching a planet for cities and searching one beach for a single specific grain of sand that looks like all the others. 

The more power you need to run your hidden civilization, the fewer places you could hide it and the easier those would be to find. 

Trying to hide a whole O’Neill Cylinder housing thousands of people and needing gigawatts of power is a problem. 

Interstellar rocks might give off less than a milliwatt of energy per square meter, you’d need some rock with at least a trillion square meters of surface area just to have a chance of hiding an O’Neill Cylinder’s emissions in one, so we’re talking about something many hundreds of kilometers across, a large asteroid or modest moon. 

They’re also the first place you’d go look when hunting for survivors. 

There’s not so many of these things in the interstellar void that you wouldn’t go take a peek, you search the biggest spots first and the smaller ones can hide less power. 

Some small rotating habitat buried in an icy rock a kilometer across could probably afford to give off a milliwatt a square meter of excess power without being noticed and that would let you get away with a few thousand watts of power. 

Enough to maybe support one person. 

Maybe a few dozen to serve as caretakers with them doing cycles in cryogenic suspension, waiting for the aliens to leave and just waking people up to tend a small hydroponic garden and check the equipment and see if the bad guys left. 

However, we already mentioned digital copies of minds and regular viewers of this channel know that it doesn’t necessarily take much power to run a civilization if it isn’t organic. 

If you are computing down near the Landauer Limit for your area’s temperature, you can get a lot of calculations done on just a single watt of power, so one radioisotope generator designed to put out a few watts of power continuously for a billion years isn’t going to have any problems running a modest civilization on that juice. 

We could hide that inside a chunk of ice about the size of a large house and even the most obsessively genocidal aliens would have problems finding and searching all of those. 

So no one one is pulling that off unless they decide to convert the entire galaxy into raw materials and clearly no one is doing that. 

If you want the specifics of how you can run a digital civilization on so little energy, check out the Matrioshka Brain episode or Civilizations at the End of Time’s discussion of black hole civilizations. 

Now speaking of black holes, they are one of the ways often suggested to hide power emissions completely, and even then you’d probably have some leakage. 

You can’t hide a Dyson sphere with one, too much gravity, but you could partially hide its emissions by having a second layer around your original Dyson Sphere that was highly reflective to its waste heat frequencies and reflected all that into a black hole. 

This is very dubious from a thermodynamics perspective but thermodynamics where black holes are concerned is somewhat iffy so we can’t close the door on the option completely. 

Still, it is not a particularly realistic option because on top of leakage or gravity being detectable, buildings such things is not covert, and if everyone sees you building your secret bunker it’s not too secret even if it is invisible when complete. 

But we do talk about using artificial black holes for power here a lot so we’ll use that as our last example for today. 

Note that we are talking about artificial black holes too, naturally occurring ones are not very common, odds are your civilization has none within many hundreds of light years, and there could be a million solar systems closer to hand. 

They also tend to have accretion disks, so suddenly blocking those by building your civilization there is going to be a red flag, though like hiding in a sun, hiding in an accretion disk might not be a bad idea if you can survive there. 

Anyway, focusing on artificial black holes, if you have the technology to make small black holes -- Kugelblitz black holes - then we can grab some very remote and decently large body, scoop out its insides, line it with a reflective material, and slap in an equal mass black hole. 

Incidentally trying to feed a black hole waste heat infrared light is harder than it sounds. 

The idea of a Kugelblitz black hole is that you use ultra-tiny and dense gamma rays to make one, but funneling infrared light and microwaves, the waste heat of a hidden civilization, into our black hole would actually be rather difficult and maybe impossible. 

Sounds strange since black holes are all-consuming gravity wells which even light can’t escape, but micro-black holes are smaller than atomic nuclei. 

Light can’t get out of them but getting it in there in the first place is a lot harder. 

Again, probably impossible, and there’s no way you are getting all the light in there. 

We’ll handwave that away though and assume you could dispose of most of your waste heat into them. 

Amusingly, this option is better for organic civilizations than digital ones. 

They don’t need much power or space and can hide in a rock the size of a house running on less power than a flashlight. 

However, the black holes that emit flashlight levels of energy tend to mass trillions of tons, modest asteroid territory and in that range where if you’re hiding it in a small body you might get noticed just by the gravity given off. 

Alternatively, a rotating habitat designed for just a few thousand people and a modest ecosystem only needs to be a kilometer or so wide and needs power supplies in the hundreds of megawatts, or gigaton black hole territory, and a kilometer-wide block of ice masses about a gigaton. 

So it works out nicely, and if you’re smart you set the icy body to have a plausible but high speed in a direction that takes it far away, preferably out of the galaxy, though clever hunters might find that suspicious enough to go check. 

Intergalactic space is a way better place to hide, and even the most determined hunters might shrug at trying to hunt through that or chase you if you’ve left the galaxy. 

I tend to be pretty skeptical about using black holes for heat disposal, it’s very dicey where the Laws of thermodynamics are concerned and I suspect it only seems to work in theory because we don’t fully know how black holes work, but I wanted to raise the option since folks do suggest using them this way. 

You can’t hide a normal black hole either, again the mass issue, but gravity is a very weak force so a micro-black hole’s gravity probably would escape notice. 

Fundamentally, if you can dump waste heat into one, it is a very good way to hide a civilization and about the only way you could hope to hide a biological one, rather than a low power digital one, inside known physics. 

And that’s where we’ll stop for the day. 

What’s our summary for Hidden Aliens? 

Short form, I don’t expect to encounter them often, and I don’t mean because they’re hard to find since they’re hiding. 

It’s just not a good approach, we have to come up with way too many convoluted motives for both the civilization hiding and who they are hiding from, who also seems to need to bypass a lot of strategies they should follow for hunting, like just colonizing everything themselves. 

On the other hand, I would expect civilizations to hide things, and the methods we discussed today work for hiding observational outposts or secret archives and backups. 

Next week we will be looking at some lesser known technologies that haven’t gained as much attention as some of the flashier technology, but are shaping the landscape for the future just as much or more, in Quiet Revolution.

Force Fields
---
  
2017-07-27  
https://youtu.be/Jg9BRaI_exo  

---

Force fields are a staple of science fiction, they’re in almost every story, yet they’re assumed to be impossible. 

Today we’ll challenge that assumption. 

When I was getting ready to do this episode I started looking around for all of the discussions I could find examining force fields in a more scientific context, but there weren’t many left to be considered after weeding out a ton that were just pseudo-science click-bait and hype. 

They tend to be great examples of Betteridge’s Law of Headlines which states that any news article headline ending with a question mark poses a question to which the answer is ‘No’. 

Alternatively, when I reviewed classic science fiction I couldn’t find many stories and settings that didn’t have some sort force field in them. 

They are rather ubiquitous, for something that hasn’t got much basis in known science. 

Part of that might come from their origin, they were popularized very early in science fiction and once a piece of tech shows up in a Sci-Fi classic it’s safe territory for other writers to use. 

Part of it though I’d guess is just the sheer power of weaponry at the end of World War II. 

With atomic bombs in play you need something stronger than armor to resist them because nukes beat matter every time. 

And of course they were just mind-blowingly cool when portrayed in movies like “Forbidden Planet”. 

That’s worth remembering too, force fields and energy beams are a very easy special effect to do in pre-computer times that looks awesome, and damage to your shield doesn’t require smashing up the scenery or expensive spaceship models. 

Now regarding the topic of natural force fields, they are real enough, which sometimes causes some confusion. 

We have 4 fundamental forces that control the interaction of matter in this: Gravity, Electromagnetism, and the Strong and Weak Nuclear Forces. 

These do have force fields, and if you can manipulate those you can affect stuff trying to pass through them. 

Indeed, NASA and others have been looking at how to use magnetic fields to protect spaceships from radiation for a long time and have made a lot of progress at using these fields to keep out harmful particles. 

This is our first big problem with forcefields, you usually want stuff like air and light to move through them, so you can see what’s going on and keep breathing, but if you’ve got a forcefield that lets light through, it would seem like it ought to let a laser through too. 

Not a very practical shield if you can’t see the people shooting at you, but also not very useful if they can zap you right through it. 

In the classic Sci Fi series Dune, by Frank Herbert, we’re introduced to personal forcefields. 

He gets around the light issue by the laser guns having a weird interaction with them that sets off a nuclear explosion killing both people, so no one uses the one on the other. 

He also has the shield designed so that only slow moving objects can pass through, thus air gets through but bullets and fast knives do not. 

In the book, the idea that “the slow knife penetrates the shield” serves as a reminder to be observant of where you are in time and space, it’s a fairly deep and philosophical book. 

Plus, he presumably wanted to capture and highlight the feudal aristocracy feel of the series with knife and sword fights, so how it works doesn’t actually matter but this is common in general for personal shields in fiction... except that in this we have a problem... 

We think of air moving rather slowly, even a strong gust of wind moves a lot slower than a baseball, let alone a bullet, but in fact air particles themselves individually move quite quickly. 

Those particles are usually zipping around a bit faster than the speed of sound, meaning they aren’t getting through unless many bullets would, and while we generally make bullets that travel between Mach 2 and Mach 3, you can use a heavier bullet travelling a bit slower to do the same damage, and all of our favorite melee weapons like clubs, swords, and axes are sub-sonic too. 

If we try to argue that only large chunks of matter, not small particles, actually count toward that barrier, then we have to worry about particle beams, or maybe just someone just shooting us with a water gun. 

One that vaporizes the water into steam on the way out, which is perhaps not practical as a long range weapon, but very painful and effective at closer quarters. 

The same holds for a flamethrower as well. 

Now those don’t really matter for the purposes of the story. 

Dune, after all, has a ton of plot holes when you think about the science, but it is still one of the best science fiction series ever written. 

Still it is those kinds of issues which we need to think about when contemplating force fields. 

We might be putting the cart in front of the horse here though. 

Before we discuss what you can use the technology for, it’s worth pondering whether we can actually achieve the technology one day. 

However, to do so we need to first understand what this technology is, in terms of its properties, to discuss it. 

What force is the field producing and controlling? 

What goes through and what doesn’t? 

The perfect classic force field stops everything, and I think are so popular in TV and films because beam weapons and force fields are very easy and safe special effects compared to bullets, explosions, point defense systems and so on. 

As I said earlier, it’s very expensive to smash holes in your spaceship when it is a real model someone assembled from plastic and glue. 

These days we tend to see more of each, indeed we often see rock, paper, scissors systems in video games. 

For attack they have projectiles, beam weapons, and missiles; for defense armor, force fields, and point defense, with some working better against others. 

This is probably a better approach to consider though, and I don’t mean because it is more interesting than just beam and shields, but because we can more easily contemplate a shield that works against something specific. 

As an example of this we have the Plasma Window, something we discussed using in the Mass Driver episode to keep air out of the device, which is essentially a big long tube you want to keep as a vacuum. 

It is actually pretty simple in concept, though harder to get working. 

Plasma is one of the four basic states of matter along with liquids, gases, and solids. 

While plasma itself is electrically neutral, just like most matter, its constituent material is all separated and ionized. 

That means it all responds strongly to magnetic fields, so we can keep it bouncing around inside a magnetic field that we control. 

If air tries to get in there it gets pushed away, for the same reason cold air has problems getting into a warm room, if none of the hot air inside can escape. 

Plasma is very hot, so if you keep a pocket of it at normal pressure or higher, other gases won’t enter, so it acts like a force field against them. 

But large fast objects can move through easily enough, though you wouldn’t want to stick your arm in a plasma window unless you need a quick tan or really want third-degree burns. 

Something like this isn’t a bad personal shield since punching folks through one isn’t a great idea, but it won’t stop bullets and it won’t stop lasers; it might stop particle beams. 

This type of shield, improved enough that you could carry one around on your belt that forms a protective cocoon around your body, would let them walk around on an airless planet without a spacesuit, though sunscreen would probably be a good idea. 

It would also let you have airlocks on spaceships without needing to pump the air out or lose it. 

Flick on the plasma window, open the airlock door, jump through. 

We have the technology for this now, it’s rather basic and energy consumptive, but it works. 

Could you ramp this up? 

Use it to contain so dense a plasma that a coherent laser couldn’t get through and bullets and such would be incinerated? 

Possibly, maybe a series of toroidal rings around the person or object like a stack of donuts full of dense plasma. 

Such a thing ought to be a monstrous energy hog, but we can’t rule it out, and trying to get a field that can do just that is the basic concept behind a Tokamak fusion reactor. 

So a civilization with compact fusion reactors that worked this way might be able to do it. 

Problem is, the thing glows rather brightly, it is superheated gas, and with a color based on that gas, we use it for making light after all. 

Those really nice plasma TVs aren’t called that as a marketing gimmick, they use plasma to make the various colors. 

If you are running one at high enough energy and density to be vaporizing bullets or scattering lasers beams you ought to be glowing like a lighthouse, which is not what you want if you’re the guy standing in the middle of it, since it would probably vaporize you too. 

You might stick it on a big ship with reflective sides, which would also help against a laser, but you’d be a pretty big target. 

Of course to be fair, as we said in the Space Warfare episode, there’s no stealth in space anyway so it’s not like it matters if they can see your shields. 

Also hard to see outside such a thing. 

We get that issue with opaque shield or cloaking fields in sci fi a lot, the two obvious workarounds would be a thin wire through the shield with a camera on it, or flicking off segments very quickly to get a look, and doing so in a random fashion so the enemy can’t determine the frequency and pattern you’re doing that at to sneak something through. 

That last works fine if you can turn the shield off in places and turn it right back on again real quick, which you can’t really do with a plasma window for instance, since you need to have a reservoir of gas to be the plasma, and inject it in there and heat it up. 

Shut the field off and it takes a little time to disperse for you to see through. 

The wire through the shield to a camera is a little trickier, not because those cameras will get blown up a lot, cameras are small, wires are small, treat them as expendable and send more. 

Rather because that wire needs to be insulated against the shield somehow and if you can insulate the wire against the shield, you can insulate a projectile slamming through the shield too. 

Which is fine if you want to send bullets out at whoever is attacking you, so you don’t have to flicker your shield, but presumably they can insulate their bullets coming at you too. 

Classic problem of course, we get a technology that makes a good weapon or defense and then someone spends their energy trying to use that same technology to defeat that tech, and you often can. 

Steel armor is better than bronze or leather armor, but if you can make steel armor you can make steel weapons, and a knife or arrowhead uses a lot less steel than a suit of full plate. 

Regardless, the plasma shield concept has some real possibilities, even in the near future, but doesn’t seem a great candidate for the classic sci fi forcefield. 

It’s an option, but can we do better? 

Real objects feel solid because of the Electromagnetic Force between particles and the Pauli Exclusion Principle that keeps them from occupying the same place. 

We saw in our discussion of active support in the Upward Bound series that while we can use this to provide passive support to an object, just as a cup sits on a table or a coat hangs from a hook, we can project particles at something to keep it in place. 

It can work as well or better in some cases as sticking supports under something. 

The idea of levitating matter kilometers up in the air can seem a bit counter-intuitive but it works, and you can see a real life demonstration of this over at Cody’s Lab, he kept a pie tin levitating quite high on a simple stream of water. 

If we can do this constantly, to replace big metal supports, we can also do this in a very short term and pinpoint fashion. 

Something attempts to enter ‘the field’ and instead of an impenetrable wall of force, it simply pushes back against that object in a carefully calculated way. 

Possibly using a reservoir of pushing material, possibly a closed loop, or possibly using material already present, like the air. 

A lot of folks will remember articles a couple years back about DARPA or Boeing having a for-real forcefield, and it’s kind of true, in a pretty literal way. 

What kills a lot of soldiers isn’t bullets, armor is actually quite good at stopping those, but traditionally in modern warfare it’s explosions that get most people. 

When an explosive goes off you have a big shock wave and shrapnel. 

What this sort of force field is doing is trying to attenuate that shockwave force, and modern electronics and computers can move very quickly, something that we need to consider when looking at these concepts. 

An explosion goes off near a vehicle, it is moving very fast but not at light speed, nothing like it. 

So that explosion can be detected before it hits, and the vehicle emits a powerful burst to turn the air between the vehicle and the approaching shock wave into a plasma-like medium, disrupting the shockwave. 

Conceptually, this is a lot like reactive armor or an airbag, and we can consider airbags a type of shield too. 

We don’t live in the 1940s when sci fi was all about rockets and rayguns, and computers were huge things that took up buildings. 

We live in an era where computers are tiny and fast. 

One where we can consider stuff like point-defense, not just shooting missiles down, but maybe even tiny bullets. 

So instead of the classic force field, maybe you are walking around with a ton of tiny lasers or guns on you, each automatically controlled. 

Instead of needing a shield that lets particles of air through, you’ve got a smart system that only turns your protection on the instant it needs it, and better yet, the place where it needs it. 

Someone goes to stab you and the shield only pops up in the exact place to intercept it or at the right spot and angle to deflect it away. 

If we don’t have that, maybe we can mimic that with a bunch of small point defense. 

It detects a bullet, it shoots the bullet with a tiny one to deflect and fragment it. 

Now it normally couldn’t intercept a laser, but it might be able to detect that one is aiming at you and shoot something in the way to intercept and diffuse it. 

We don’t have many laser weapons yet, we use them with a lot of weapons, but they’re not a great anti-personnel weapon by themselves unless you have either a very compact and high-power generator or some really awesome batteries. 

Lasers, even modern ones, aren’t too efficient and batteries don’t tend to store a lot of power nor discharge it too quickly, so chemical based propellants, firearms, are still a lot better. 

If that changes, we’ll start seeing laser guns. 

Realistically, you kind of need stuff like that for a forcefield too though, so if you’ve got personal forcefields you probably have man-portable laser and particle weapons. 

We can deflect a particle stream magnetically, but a laser is harder. 

What stops a laser? 

Well a laser is composed of photons, but they are the carrier for the electromagnetic force. 

And while they transmit it, they aren’t affected by it. 

No magnetic shield is going to stop a laser. 

Gravity can, it bends light and can red or blue shift it, so if you had some way to generate gravity, or better yet, anti-gravity, you could have a field of that which could redshift a laser beam down so it was too weak to hurt you. 

Better yet, instead of an omnidirectional field, maybe a beam or focused blast of it to just redshift the area the beam is entering. 

But if you do have gravity and anti-gravity, then you also probably have a new kind of weapon to contend with as well. 

Since we don’t have any way to generate gravity, besides raw mass, and anti-gravity is one of those topics that occupies the hazy area of physics, while anti-gravity would be a massive game-changer technology, we’ll save discussing that for another time. 

In the absence of that, we can use reflective armor, or even reactive armor that explodes when punched. 

That’s handy for stopping projectiles, an explosion that pushes back against the incoming projectile essentially, but those also put lots of vaporized matter in the way that diffuses an incoming laser beam too. 

Alternatively, we have the option of shooting that out away from us, in between the beam and the target. 

A tiny mirror that gets in the way or a pocket of gas to disrupt and absorb the beam. 

Notice though that we keep talking about focused, smart defense, not some big dumb bubble around you. 

Partially because that seems to be what physics allows us, but mostly because it’s smarter. 

Instead of a big bubble on all the time, burning power, something that is pinpointed in time and space. 

That’s rule number one of warfare, smart beats dumb every time. 

It doesn’t replace armor and neither should a force field, since nothing quite replaces the value of lots of dumb matter in the way to absorb damage, but there’s always a cost to that. 

Walking around in body armor is exhausting, even the modern light weight stuff that’s flexible. 

If you ever need to lose weight fast, grab yourself a nice Kevlar vest and ballistic plate and go jog around for a few hours, builds muscle and burns fat, through a treadmill is better for the back. 

But whether we’re talking about body armor or vehicle armor or armor on spaceships, it slows you down and makes you less agile. 

This is a big no-no under rule number one of warfare, which is to avoid getting hit. 

So some system, like a suit of liquid armor that could detect an approaching impact and flood the spot with the fluid, or a personal point-defense system that could shoot stuff out to block a hit like a classic shield, would help. 

And by classic shield, I mean old school, a thing that gets in between you and the other thing trying to kill you, not a forcefield. 

So in some ways, we’re seeing that even if a forcefield is possible, it maybe isn’t what we ideally want anyway, not unless it only expends energy when it gets hit. 

Ultimately though, to get a real force field, we want technology that can play with gravity or inertia in a very significant and controllable way. 

But let’s say we have something like that? 

What is it good for besides keeping you from getting killed, an application that admittedly is quite valuable even if you can’t use it for anything else. 

We have the obvious use, instead of using armor you use shields, but you can take that a step further and replace your hull entirely with forcefields. 

I mean the point of spaceship is to keep the air in and keep the radiation out, so a bunch of force fields do the same thing. 

Unless we’re sticking to the notion of some magic single bubble you’d presumably have lots of individual ones and backups that could kick in if a chunk of pseudo-hull fails. 

I think you’d still want some actual hull as an extra backup and to keep folks from going insane at the thought of them failing, but you could keep it to a minimum thickness. 

This lets you do much better with active support structures too; we discussed those in the Upward Bound series and this is basically the same concept, instead of needing a big foundation and pylons to hold a building miles up in there, it’s just resting on a forcefield instead. 

Fundamentally a lot of our limitations on doing things don’t come from basic physics, but rather from all the engineering constraints placed on us by the fundamental limits on material strength from chemical and atomic bonds, or getting rid of all the heat built up doing stuff. 

That’s an issue for stuff like star lifting for instance, the process of magnetically scooping matter off a star that we’ve discussed before. 

You need to be close to a star to do that, and stars tend to be rather hot. 

We can use magnetic fields to deflect away charged particles like plasma hitting stuff near a star and make the exposed surface very reflective so light doesn’t heat it up, but that’s very tricky to get just right, so you can put stuff near a star. 

A force field alters that equation a bit, though it depends on how it works. 

Heat buildup tends to be a big handwave with sci fi force fields. 

If you’ve got some shield that can shrug off atomic blasts hitting your spaceship and energy beams that could roast cities, where exactly is all that energy and heat going? 

Is it bouncing away? 

Ought to be giving your ship a big shove in the process even if you can bounce it all. 

Or are you absorbing it? 

If so, where to? 

Your ship? 

The energy released in an atomic blast, even if you can distribute that all evenly so it's just heat added to your ship, would probably be enough to roast every person on that ship. 

So if we’re assuming it can deflect nuclear blasts and their energy, you’ve got something that can let you casually fly into a star, or at least hover right over one. 

If it’s good enough to let you go hang out in stars, that’s a pretty neat place to hide stuff, like entire civilizations. 

Which is out topic for next week. 

Force fields are a lot like replicators - the ones from Star Trek that make stuff, not the ones from Stargate which, actually, also make stuff but mostly more of themselves and in a hostile, Grey Goo fashion not a Tea, Earl Grey fashion – but force fields are like, replicators, the more you think it about the more you come up with stuff it can do that’s so awesome it kind of spoils the show when you think about it. 

Replicators are a lot like a magic lamp with a genie, your first wish is for more wishes and the first thing you replicate is another replicator and the power plant that runs it… which is more or less how the Stargate Replicators, Grey Goo, and von Neumann machines work. 

Then you tell half of them to keep replicating and the other half to build stuff, like spaceships with forcefields. 

You can use a forcefield to make a window, we also often consider walls with TV screen that are so high resolution they can just switch from showing you the news to the outdoors just like you were looking through a window, but you can probably tune a forcefield to act like a TV too. 

I mean if it can block light, it can presumably do that selectively. 

Or a set of speakers, after all sound is just vibrating waves. 

So maybe your personal forcefield isn’t protecting you, it's cloaking you and making a decoy that looks and sounds like you a few feet away. 

Gives you the option for very realistic holograms too. 

Things you can see and hear and touch, and also lets you remotely control stuff a lot more intuitively than piloting a robot drone. 

Maybe you don’t use steel plows on farms anymore, just run some force fields through them to churn the Earth instead, maybe that’s how you plow snow off the roads in the winter. 

Maybe you pop them up over roads to bounce the snow away in the first place. 

You don’t carry an umbrella, one just pops up over your head and shoulders, or over the boulevard, all of the fun of walking in the rain without the wet clothes. 

No soft mattress or gel padding, your bed is a forcefield that tunes to right comfort and support, the soles in your shoes carefully absorb the impact of your steps better than gel or rubber. 

You don’t break your ankle jogging over a groundhog hole or your car axle driving over a pothole because your shoes or car see it and drop a forcefield right there, you don’t slip on the ice because it makes that spot have friction and tread. 

Your handy personal forcefield keeps out bad odors from your personal air from folks who went jogging, but skipped on a shower. 

You maybe don’t need sunscreen either because it keeps ultraviolet light off you, but not the rest, good way to heat and cool your house too, or your planet, if you can selectively tune what wavelengths of light can pass through or reflect, or what speed of particles can get through and what can’t. 

Come to think of it, if you can selectively let only certain speeds of particles through while bouncing others back, you might be able to tell the laws of thermodynamics to buzz off and separate warm fluids into a hot and cold side. 

Those aren’t as awesome as a personal forcefield that bounces off bullets or lets you walk around on an airless planet, but at a day to day level they are a lot more handy, especially that last one, which is basically Maxwell’s Demon and a perpetual motion machine. 

We don’t have a roadmap to forcefield technology, but we’ve seen some gimmicks that let us do about the same thing and maybe that’s another example. 

It would be neat to have an invisible bridge between two tall buildings instead of a solid structure, but perhaps instead of a forcefield bridge you can walk across, something that just pushes against your feet in midair, targeting every step to provide push back as you walk. 

Micro-size something like this enough, and with enough computer power, and maybe you could have a holodeck like in Star Trek, but where it’s only making stuff solid when you’re touching, applying just enough force by shooting stuff there at just the right moments and locations, possibly so fine-tuned you could feel textures and heat. 

We have no way of knowing what cool new physics might emerge in the future that maybe allow us the classic force field, but we’ve seen today some of the options that allow us close equivalents or alternatives, as well as some of cooler uses this technology might permit that we tend to skip over when thinking about spaceships and ray guns. 

Personally I wouldn’t expect that we’d ever get the classic force field, but it’s not something we can rule out entirely yet and those close equivalents and alternatives at least are decently plausible. 

Next week we will be returning the Alien Civilizations Series, for a look at Hidden Civilizations, in Hidden Aliens.

Fermi Paradox Great Filters: Rare Earth
---
  
2017-07-20  
https://youtu.be/oIva_60l3ww  

---

Ever since Copernicus showed us we’re not the center of the Universe, we have tried to emphasize that Earth is probably not that special or unique. 

As it turns out, that might not be case after all. 

So today we return to the Great Filters series to continue our look at the Fermi Paradox. 

As a reminder, one of the more popular solutions to the Fermi Paradox, the strange-seeming absence of other intelligent life in our huge and ancient Universe, is that Occam’s Razor applies in this case and that the reason for the seeming absence of other civilizations is exactly that, they don’t exist. 

While we can consider the possibility that they existed in the past, but all died out after getting technology, the alternative explanation is that they just don’t occur much. 

Since there is no obvious reason why they wouldn’t, we tend to assume that there are, instead, a lot of little steps and conditions involved in a planet becoming life-bearing and staying that way long enough for life to get intelligent. 

Each of those steps and conditions is called a filter, basically a hurdle you would need to get past that filters out potential civilizations arising on a planet. 

Last time we defined a number of different types of filters, from lesser to greater, the former being ones that most will pass through, coin flip odds or better, while the latter is more comparable to lottery odds or less. 

I also mentioned before that you can often group related smaller filters into one Great Filter, though you can’t always do the reverse and break up a great filter into a collection of smaller component ones. 

This series focuses on possible Great Filters and while we discussed three last time, we are only looking at one for this episode and will generally stick to that. 

Our focus for today is the famous “Rare Earth” Hypothesis, and more specifically the conditions about Earth and our solar system, which might make it nearly uniquely suited among planets to host intelligent life and technological species. 

I want to emphasize “intelligent and technologically advanced” right up front, because for the Fermi Paradox we don’t care about some barren twilight planet hosting simple lichen, not unless that lichen has developed a complex and enlightened civilization building spaceships and radio transmitters. 

So while we can look at a place like Pluto and say “Yes there’s a chance life might develop there in some deep subsurface pocket of muddy water warmed by nuclear decay or tidal heating”, we can also rule it out as a place to look for alien homeworlds. 

There’s just not enough energy flux there to allow a complex and fast ecosystem that would permit intelligence to arise. 

Brains are very expensive in terms of energy and organs demanding resources and have to be constantly of value at every step of an evolutionary progression. 

An Oak Tree doesn’t have a brain, for instance, because it would offer no advantage to its survival, not when it has no means to implement any decisions that brain makes. 

So outside of the specific case of a Boltzmann Brain or something parallel, where the brain just sort of blunders into existence fully formed, we are justified in assuming only a high-energy environment could offer enough life to generate such a predator-prey mental arms race and do so quickly enough for it to have already happened. 

Evolution takes time, but more importantly, it takes generations; and more complex critters tend to have longer generational cycles, bacteria can reproduce hourly, we do not. 

There have been an estimated 100 billion humans who have ever lived, or 10^11. 

We can estimate that maybe a billion times that many mammals have ever lived, or 10^20, most on an annual or longer generational cycle. 

Throw in insects who are far more numerous and have been around much longer, and you can go up about a billion times more, 10^29, and if we include bacteria, perhaps a trillion times that many, 10^42, have ever lived. 

Each of those organisms represents an evolutionary event, mostly a failed or meaningless one, but that gives you an idea how many of these events need to take place to generate some folks sitting around a campfire sharpening stone axes and wondering what the pretty points of light in the sky mean. 

Most of those events had nothing to do with your genetic makeup, a better designed oak leaf is unrelated to your own DNA, but growing intelligence is a reaction to the entire ecosystem evolving so it does matter. 

It’s not hard for an organism to learn to eat grass properly, they don’t need a ton of brains or sensory gear for that, they need it for responding to other animals who either want to eat the same grass or eat them. 

We’ll talk more about the brain race in the future, but for today I mention it primarily to emphasize how many overall generations and individual evolutionary events were needed to get here. 

If that’s fairly normal, then we have to consider that any planet that can support less life, or requires it to live slower, is less likely to have gotten technology by now because of fewer of those evolutionary events. 

Make the year 10% longer and critters that breed annually around the food supply of seasons evolve 10% slower, though that is probably optimistic since they would need bigger food stores to survive the longer winter and therefore support fewer of those critters to do the evolving. 

We’ll talk about this more in the future, but for now it’s important to remember that we’re not discussing where life could exist, or even where technology might eventually develop, but where it is likely to have already developed. 

After all, the Universe is fairly young still. 

We’ll start there. 

Once the universe explodes into existence it takes a long while to develop a structure where Earth-like planets can be common, and today we are going to try to assume that it almost has to be an Earth-like planet to offer a good chance for civilizations to emerge. 

So what do we know about Earth that matters? 

The first step is to ask about its basic position in time and space. 

Earth is not an old planet at all, the Universe was about 9 billion years old already when it formed. 

If we compare the entirety of time to one 24-hour day starting at midnight, Earth formed at about 4 o’clock in the afternoon, two-thirds of the way through the day. 

Life didn’t crawl up on land till an hour before midnight. 

Now you already know that it took a long while for enough heavy elements to form in dying stars to produce rocky planets like Earth, but it did not take that long. 

Earth’s composition relates to the Metallicity of our own Sun, that being all the stuff in a star besides hydrogen and helium, the only two elements that existed in any real quantity prior to stars making them. 

We often also look at this as the ratio of Iron to Hydrogen in a star, iron incidentally being the most abundant element on Earth, just beating out oxygen, which is the third most common element in the Universe. 

The relation of those two is pretty important as well, since our oxygen-rich atmosphere only came after the iron in the upper crust of the planet became saturated with more oxygen than it could sequester even with tectonic activity turning over new iron. 

Oxygen is obviously very important to high-energy mobile lifeforms, as is the oxygenic photosynthesis process that supplies all of our food and releases that oxygen. 

Oxygen that also consequently poisoned off the life that lived before then and used anoxygenic photosynthesis or other far weaker energy sources that don’t rely on sunlight. 

Likewise, oxygen is an excellent fuel, or oxidizer, and its sheer abundance everywhere in the Universe should tend to make it the preferred substance for critters to consume, we each use nearly a kilogram of it every day. 

Our sun’s metallicity, Z, is 0.0196, or meaning just under 2% of the Sun’s mass is stuff other than hydrogen and helium. 

As I said, we are also often interested in the iron-to-hydrogen ratio, partially because it matters for planet formation, but mostly because it’s a lot easier to determine both iron and hydrogen content of stars than most of the other stuff in them. 

From this we can make a good guess at the rest of elements. 

Metallicity is a bit more intuitive though, and is what I will use to discuss this. 

However, if you go hunting for more data you will see as many graphs with Fe/H on an axis as Z for Metallicity, and it helps to avoid confusion. 

So the sun is 2% metals, and so essentially were all of the early planets forming out of the nebula that became our solar system. 

That got quite hot and when the sun ignited it started adding radiation and solar wind to the mix. 

Planets lost all their helium and neon, the second and fourth most abundant elements in the modern Universe. 

They are quite light and easily blown away, and being Noble gases they’re so aristocratic and snobby they won’t even hang out with each other, let alone the peasant elements. 

Hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon are all pretty light too, but they can form heavy molecules that stuck around. 

However the over-abundance of hydrogen meant that most couldn’t find any dance partners and so they also blew away. 

Oxygen is likewise very common and will dance with almost anyone, so most of the hydrogen that didn't blow away paired up with them as water. 

So the warmer planets of the inner solar system are rocky, not so much because they started out with more of those elements than the Sun or outer gas giants, but rather because those are the main things that stuck around under the heat. 

Their absence from the thousands of exoplanets we’ve found so far doesn’t indicate rarity, it is just that it’s far easier to see big planets and those close to their sun, so we see a lot of very big and hot planets. 

It would seem a safe bet though, that you need a metallicity decently close to our own Sun’s or higher to get many large rocky planets. 

The metallicity of stars is always higher the younger they are, not because they lose that as they age, but because as the Universe ages the amount of metals increases as more and more stars go supernova so the younger newer ones tend to be higher. 

However, there are plenty of stars younger than ours with lower metallicity and somewhat older ones with higher metallicity. 

Most aren’t however, we are pretty much in the thick of the bell-curve in that regard. 

You can find a fair number which are a billion or more years older than ours with higher metallicity, but they start getting very scant at more than 8 billion years of age. 

We can, however, safely conclude that systems with lots of rocky planets with the same basic composition as our own, have been quite common since at least a billion years before our own came into existence, and perhaps a few more. 

We generally divide stars into populations 1 and 2, and really old ones are labeled population 3, based on how much metal they have. 

That’s a very broad and arbitrary categorization, so it might be that not all population 1 metal-rich stars like our sun have enough metal or that some population 2 stars do. 

Indeed we’ve found planets around fairly low metallicity stars too. 

What this establishes however, is that we can’t consider the metallicity of our own sun and its age to be more than a lesser or minor filter itself in terms of setting boundaries, though those lesser filters can stack up as we’ve discussed before. 

Ditto the fact that we often discard the inner galaxy as a place for life because of all the radiation and higher star density sterilizing planets or perturbing their orbits, but the spiral arms of our galaxy are quite heavy in the metal-rich population 1 stars so this isn’t much of a filter either. 

It should be noted, though, that the further you get from a galactic core in galaxies like our own, the less metals you tend to have. 

So we have a galactic Goldilocks zone, too close, radiation and perturbation, too far and there are not enough metals, but realistically it is hard to argue this is much more than a lesser filter. 

So, that gives us two lesser filters so far, we’ll treat both as 50/50 at the end when we total everything up, though I suspect we’re being generous for both and it’s more likely less than 50/50. 

Of course everything I just said applies only to stable spiral arms galaxies; when you look at other types, the conditions tend to be less favorable and as I’ve mentioned on this topic before, you can’t just write-off other galaxies from the Fermi Paradox. 

However, for today we will focus on our own galaxy, so we can use its total stellar population as our comparison number at the end and also bypass further complicating stuff like quasars, galactic mergers, and so on. 

Though it is also worth remembering that our own galaxy is a serious cannibal and has eaten a ton of lesser galaxies, though by and large this sort of process shouldn’t tinker too much with how habitable various individual solar systems are. 

This and other factors have to be considered, for example, a star’s orbit around a galaxy being stable and not passing through the hazardous core or too close to big dense pockets of stars. 

I will add that as another lesser filter and we’ll call that the “Safe Galactic Orbit” filter. 

A lot of stars are also binaries or in packs so dense that they would tend to destabilize stable planetary orbits, and we will make that our fourth lesser filter, again that’s probably being generous. 

Now another one that gets suggested a lot is being hit by a supernova shock wave or a dreaded gamma ray burst, but that needs some quick context. 

You need to be very close to one to get a planet sterilizing event that can kill off even deep ocean life and that won’t be too common. 

Nevertheless, if it kills off all large land life, which would take a lot less impact, you do get a substantial reset. 

Yes lots of bacteria will survive, probably even lots of insects, and certainly stuff deep in the ocean unless we got really whammied, but they will recover fairly quickly and let evolution fill up the missing niches again. 

Extinction events are hard to classify for the Fermi Paradox though, that’s because it’s hard to predict how common major or near-total ones were even in Earth’s history, let alone that of other solar systems in general. 

Coupled to that, such events can often be beneficial, clearing and leveling the Darwinian battleground as it were. 

Dinosaurs were probably already on their way out, but if that asteroid hadn’t hit, we might not be here today. 

So I am going to ball up all the various extraterrestrial extinction causes – supernovae, gamma-ray-bursts, asteroid bombardment, etc into one rather nebulous filter and that one I will make our first minor filter. 

As a reminder, lesser filters were the kind we thought lowered the odds to no worse than a coin flip, while minor was anything that most didn’t pass through but wasn’t terrible odds, no lower than 1%, and for our final calculation today I’ll treat it as 10%, again we are using the favorable values. 

Now not all Suns are the same, and while we call our sun a yellow dwarf, it is actually one of the most massive stars out there. 

It got that misnomer because in early cataloging we could only see the biggest and brightest stars, just as now we can only see the biggest and hottest exoplanets. 

Interestingly, the Sun is about as massive as a star can be and still support life. 

Stellar lifetime shortens exponentially with a rise in mass, as its cube, so a star twice our mass lives one-half-cubed, or one-eighth as long. 

So if our Sun was even 30% more massive it would be just about ready to die by now. 

To make things worse, since a star gets hotter as time goes by, it’s habitable zone will probably have shifted much more noticeably during that time rendering some planets uninhabitable that used to be habitable. 

That is expected to happen here on Earth in the next billion or so years, even if the Sun’s main-sequence normal lifetime will still have a few billions years left on the clock. 

This is not a good filter though, because only a small percentage of stars are actually massive enough to live so short a time. 

It matters only if we are assuming life is limited to other G-type stars. 

As a G2 star, our sun is fairly large even for other G-types stars, that scale goes from 0 to 9, with 0 being largest and 9 smallest. 

Of the seven classic Spectral Types, O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, only K and M are smaller than G but each of those groups has a higher population than the other five combined. 

The habitability of all those stars is therefore of great interest to us, as they are way more numerous, and we did one of earliest episodes on that topic, BUT, we actually don’t care about them for today's topic because of what I mentioned earlier about total evolutionary events. 

For a civilization to emerge it needs a decently high number of those total events. 

It is a regrettably clumsy and ham-fisted way to look at the issue and we’ll spend more time on it later in the series, but for now we have to consider that if a planet is tidally locked to a small red dwarf star, as we have decent reason to think would tend to be the case, that planet has a far smaller habitable region to support life. 

Less space, less life, therefore fewer evolutionary events. 

Again, we don’t care if they’ve got life, we care if they’ve evolved into civilizations. 

We also need to keep in mind that photosynthesis on Earth does not use all of the sun’s spectrum, and smaller stars emit even less light in that photosynthetic range. 

Less useful available energy, less life, more of the material in that life devoted to basic fuel gathering rather than other survival tasks, and so on. 

It doesn’t mean all those stars are uninhabited, there’s a lot of question marks about tidal locking, atmosphere slowing locking or being torched away, solar activity being more erratic, and so on, but they aren’t good candidates to produce civilizations and they make up 90% of the stars. 

So I will give this one Minor Filter Status too, though we will also attach to this category things that make stars erratic in their output as well, our sun is pretty stable compared to most. 

So we are at 4 lesser and 2 minor filters so far. 

How about planetary position? 

Each star has a habitable zone, we roughly classify that as any place where water is a liquid, not too hot, not too cold. 

That’s very debatable since you could have moons around gas giants that were warm enough by tidal heating for instance, but it is a decently solid filter. 

Not because such zones are rare, every star has one, and we think most stars have planets these days, so one being there isn’t too improbable. 

However we have to consider three important factors on this. 

First, what are the odds that planet is about as massive as Earth? 

Doesn’t matter if some tiny planet like Mars is there, it could never hold an atmosphere that close to the Sun for billions of years. 

Doesn’t matter if a big planet like Jupiter is there, no life is evolving on a gas giant, not to technological civilizations anyway, although maybe a large moon around one might. 

That last wouldn’t seem too probable though since no moon in our solar system is even close to being as massive as Earth. 

Ganymede is the biggest, actually larger than Mercury though less massive, and has a surface gravity that’s only 15% of Earth’s. 

So we have to consider that it needs to be a planet decently close to Earth’s own size, though how close is hard to say. 

I said three things though and the second would be that it needs to be staying inside that habitable zone, most planets don’t have circular orbits, Earth has one of the lowest orbital eccentricities, Venus lower still, while Mercury has the highest. 

Odds are pretty good that the official habitable zones are already too generous and those near the edges won’t be hospitable for life, if you add eccentricity into that it gets worse. 

And of course even if a system has a habitable zone with planets near it, there might not be one actually in it, so we’ll make that Lesser Filter 5, no planet of any sort happens to occupy the habitable zone, when the system forms. 

For #6, we’ll include the chance that the planet gets itself knocked out of orbit or captured or ejected out of the system or into the Sun. 

Orbits aren’t nearly as stable as we often think; odds are better than good that not all of the planets we started out with in our solar system are still here and probably aren’t all quite where they began. 

Indeed, it seems likely that at least one time Earth got smacked by one, and it’s also a pretty popular theory that one nailed Venus causing its peculiarly slow spin, thus having a day longer than its year. 

Systems with more planets would probably be even more vulnerable to such things, especially if they had big planets closer in. 

The mass of a planet in the habitable zone, if we have one, matters a lot. 

We do not have a good inventory of planets yet to say what percentage of them are of any certain size, but we have started finding a lot of Super-Earths out there in habitable zones or closer so we know there’s no special barrier against their existing. 

In between things like Mercury and Jupiter is a mass difference of about 1000... and you could go bigger or smaller and still have that habitable zone dominated by that planet so no others could be there. 

We can’t assume planets are evenly distributed by mass, that there’s as many planets twice the size of Earth as there are half the size or ten times the size. 

Indeed, what we do know suggests otherwise, but if we did assume that for the moment, then we have a Major Filter right there, because of possible planets -- from dwarf planet’s just big enough to dominate their orbit to super-Jovians nearly big enough to count as a star - only a tiny range of those could plausibly support the kind of life we’re interested in even if we are stretching plausibility. 

We’ll give this one Minor Filter Status, our third, though it would not be hard to argue it was a Major Filter all on it own... we just don’t know and where there is uncertainty, we will err on the side of generosity today. 

So 3 minor and 6 lesser. 

I’m going to bypass our day length and axial tilt because those are very dependent on our moon, arguably so is our crustal composition since the Moon formed when we got whacked by some other planet, or rather when two planets smacked each other to form our current one and the moon. 

For a long time we thought the Moon itself such an anomaly that it might be a great filter all by itself, but newer models say that such giant moons might not be so uncommon after all. 

Uncommon or ultra-rare, our big moon is a huge factor in all sorts of things that make our planet stable and livable, yet at the same time many of these factors just seem to better the odds for life not really exclude it for Earth-like planets without a moon, so while we should probably still list the Moon as a major Filter overall, I will keep it at Minor filter status. 

We used to be sure the Moon was a key factor, as I said, but one of the examples for that is that life began in tidal pools, and the Moon dominates those, but the sun alone causes decent tides and we also tend to tilt more to expecting life to have emerged around underwater thermal vents, so I feel we should hedge our bets and say Minor. 

Speaking of those thermal vents, our planet’s tectonic activity and molten core are hugely important both towards providing us with a protective magnetosphere, as well as ensuring plate tectonics that both give us thermal vents and help create a geological cycle that replenishes elements on the surface and ensures there is surface land that hasn’t been eroded away, making the planet all one big sea. 

Yet while such activity is vitally important, and probably less common on smaller planets for instance, we’ve already excluded those and we don’t have too much reason to think there’s a very narrow zone of these permissible that most Earth-sized planets would lack. 

These are both very big factors though. 

A planet’s magnetosphere controls whether or not it can keep an atmosphere in the long term, and the spin rate of planet effects that, while at the same time, the faster a planet spins, the stronger the erosive winds and storms trying to erode away the land. 

Too much tectonic activity could be devastating, indeed, considering how many cities were ruined by Earthquakes in the past, if those were stronger and more common folks might never settle down to build cities… and yet too little of such activity and you won’t have land masses or the geological pump that brings up new minerals and helps sequester oxygen early on. 

Too many uncertainties, so again we’ll be cautious and call each just a lesser filter, placing us at 8 lesser and 4 minor. 

There are so many others we could look at, and many we’ve shoved together into broader filters. 

There are many more still to come too, we’ve just looked at those which are characteristic of our planet’s composition and position, the core Rare Earth filters, but that was our focus for today so let’s total them up. 

Remember that we classified a Great Filter as something virtually none passed, one in a million at best and often worse. 

We also said that for our totaling today we would treat a lesser filter as 50/50 and a minor one as 1 in 10. 

Many of them we looked at today were probably way worse odds than that, but let’s see how we come out with 8 lesser filters and 4 minor ones. 

Cumulative odds can just be multiplied together, the odds of flipping a coin heads is 1 in 2, the odds of doing so twice in row, one half times one half, or 1 in 4, three times 1 in 8. 

So our 8 lesser filters are 1 in 2^8, or 1 in 256. 

Not bad, our 4 minor filters, 1 in 10, are worse, 1 in 10^4, or 1 in 10,000. 

Combined together they equal 1 in 2,560,000. 

Less than 1 in a million, so we establish a good case for the conditions on Earth to be a Great Filter. 

Incidentally if we treated those 4 minor filters as just 1%, our lower end value for minor filters, it would be 1 in 2,560,000,000, not a million. 

But, our goal was just to show that it qualified as a Great Filter, not the worst case scenario. 

Even that value though would still leave a hundred planets in our galaxy with those conditions, and our more moderate value would allow for a hundred thousand. 

But it does seriously lower the odds for civilizations to emerge and flourish. 

Some folks stop here, indeed many of the filters we used could easily be boosted to Minor Filter status, not Lesser, and in doing so would smash the odds down to a lot less than one such planet a galaxy, but for my part I tend to think we are in about the right zone with our figures, and that it’s the filters that come after this in developing intelligence and technology that help sweep the odds further down. 

There’s so much uncertainty to all these values, and the reasoning behind them, that we just can’t say much for sure. 

But this is the basis of the Rare Earth Solution to the Fermi Paradox, and as you can see, it makes a pretty good case for Earth-like planets that can foster technological civilizations to be quite uncommon and possibly so rare that you won’t find another one even in the entire galaxy. 

Next time in this series we will look at the biological side of things in more detail and see how all those factors can stack up to form yet another Great Filter, but before that we will be discussing some other topics, and in next week’s episode we’ll examine the popular science fiction concept of force fields and see if there’s any room for that to become science reality, not science fiction, and also discuss some of the fun things you could do with them if you had them.

Civilizations at the End of Time: Iron Stars
---
  
2017-07-13  
https://youtu.be/Pld8wTa16Jk  

---

We’ve occasionally talked about what it might be like to be the last sentient life left standing at the End of the Time and looking back at your once glorious civilization. 

But what if we spin the time dial even further ahead in time… set it all the way past the End of Eternity, until that last person couldn’t even remember their past civilization? 

It’s been a year since we did the first episode of the Civilizations at the End of Time series, Black Hole Farming. 

To my surprise, that episode went on to become the most watched one on the channel, so it seems like it deserves a sequel. 

It probably shouldn’t have been too surprising since the end of time and civilization is something upon which we ponder and speculate quite a lot. 

It is also the conceptual center of numerous stories both in and out of science fiction. 

The best of these, in my opinion, is the short story “The Last Question”, by the grand master of science fiction, Isaac Asimov. 

Since this episode is sponsored by Audible, and is our first occasion working with them, we’ll spend a little time discussing Asimov near the end, and try to keep it spoiler-free because you can pick up "The Last Question” by using my link Audible.com/Isaac, or click on the link in the description below. 

That gets you a FREE audio book and a 30 day free trial of Audible. 

But the problem with doing a sequel to a video about the End of Time is that there’s not really supposed to be a sequel, unless you have a time machine. 

As I said in that discussion, there are things we could do to keep life going even after the Black Hole Era, but to do that, we should first recap some of what we have already discussed last time, then introduce concepts like Boltzmann Brains, and the Margolus–Levitin Limit on quantum computing and reversible computing. 

We also need to discuss quantum tunneling, proton decay, iron stars, and the fate of the Universe itself. 

We’ll try to keep the technical aspects to a minimum, but they are there, and this is going to be a fairly long episode, so as always, it might not be a bad idea to grab a drink and snack before we start. 

To recap what we explored in the original episode, a black hole can be tapped for energy in three principal ways. 

The first and easiest is to drop mass into the thing and capture its kinetic energy as it plummets -- like attaching a rock to a string wrapped around a generator and tossing the rock off the side of building. 

The second is to use its rotational energy like a big dynamo; slowing down its spin in exchange for electricity. 

The third method is to tap into the Hawking Radiation that they are believed to emit. 

For very small black holes, there is actually a much higher amount emitted at a given time than from bigger ones. 

Any black hole gives off a large chunk of its mass energy as Hawking Radiation, but while the big ones have more overall, double the mass, double the energy, they give it off far more slowly. 

If you double the mass, you also quarter the energy it gives off for any given time period. 

The amount of power is also constantly rising, since in the absence of sufficient new material upon which to feed, the black hole’s mass shrinks, and smaller black holes give off more power. 

In an ideal scenario, you would make your own black hole with the power generation rate you wanted and just keep feeding it matter to maintain it at the same level of mass. 

You could make one that masses about a billion tons, gives off a billion watts of power, a gigawatt, and lives for about a trillion years, giving off that amount of power the whole time. 

Ideally, you could feed matter into such a black hole indefinitely, replacing whatever was burnt off. 

That’s roughly the power output of our bigger nuclear and hydroelectric plants, and you’d only need to feed it about a kilogram of matter per year to keep it going indefinitely. 

“Indefinitely,” is a theoretically incorrect term in this context, however, because the entire galaxy masses out somewhere near 10^42 kilograms, enough to feed such a black hole generator for a million, million, million, million, million, million, million years. 

Not bad, considering humanity’s basically been around for a million years, and we will start running out of natural starlight in the Universe in a few million, million years. 

Yet a naturally occurring black hole lives even longer than that, and does so by trickling its power out far more slowly. 

We discussed harnessing power from such behemoths in the original episode, by dropping matter into them or tapping their rotational energy, but this won’t let you get all of their energy. 

Whereas a smaller black hole evaporates via Hawking Radiation quite quickly, naturally occurring ones do so at such a slow rate that it could take eons to gather enough power to flip a single switch. 

Once you’ve exhausted all of its rotational energy, which is enormous, and dropped in every last bit of the spare matter you have, all that’s left is that Hawking Radiation. 

However, running an entire civilization on levels of power that you’d need sensitive equipment to even detect is probably impossible... 

...Impossible for ‘biological’ life anyway. 

Once you start abandoning neurons in favor of computer chips, the game changes a lot. 

Doing so means that now, hypothetically, you can take advantage of those longer-lived black holes. 

They give off just tiny trickles of power, but it takes a lot less energy to run a computer-based human and you would also be able to slow down the speed of consciousness. 

It doesn’t matter if it takes you a trillion years to complete a sentence when everyone else experiences time just as slowly and the outside universe is a pretty dead and boring place anyways. 

In part, that’s what we meant about these being civilizations at the end of time, because our classic view of time starts meaning less and less. 

Right now, time is a pretty constant thing for us that we all experience at more or less the same rate. 

Yet time slows near black holes, so you can move in close to them to slow things down too, and if you are also tweaking your rate of thinking down to a glacial pace, you are experiencing periods of time long enough for stars to live and die like ticks on a clock. 

This only tells us what we can do when we run out of other power sources though, how to keep going when you run out of stars. 

What we explored in the original episode however, was how something called the Landauer Limit, which demonstrates that the theoretical maximum calculations you can get out of a given amount of energy depends on the temperature. 

The colder it is, the more efficient your computers, if that is their limit; half the temperature, double the calculations per joule of energy used. 

This massively changes the dynamic, because suddenly you are not striving to survive after the stars have burned out, but intentionally hoarding your energy until after then because you can use it way more efficiently. 

As the Universe expands, it gets cooler and cooler, and right now it’s about a hundredth the temperature Earth is; meaning a computer out in the void should be able to do a hundred times the calculations for the same amount of energy as one can here on Earth. 

Quintillions of years in the future, when the whole Universe is not even a thousandth of that temperature, you get way more processing power, or thinking and living (to put it in human terms), per unit of mass or energy. 

Entire planets and planetary populations could be run in real-time on less energy than it takes to power whatever speakers you’re currently listening to me on. 

So a civilization might gather up all the matter that it can, storing virtually all of it until the temperature drops to whatever the minimum is that they can function on. 

From a practical standpoint, a given switch in a computer will need a very long time to cool back down after you use it in order to to exploit that ultra-low temp computing. 

This actually works out fine since the biggest black hole gives off power so slowly that you’d need trillions of years’ worth to power a lightbulb for an instant. 

These factors coincide well if we have very durable equipment that requires minimal maintenance, since external objective time is almost meaningless in a dark, post-stellar Universe. 

Internal subjective time would be everything, and to the participants things would seem quite normal. 

In such a scenario, the period of time after the stars burn out is no longer some dead place where at best the last remnants of civilization are barely holding out for just a little while longer. 

It could be hosting mega-civilizations that would not even notice a trillion years going by in objective time, while enjoying trillions of trillions of years of subjective time. 

You could basically have a civilization living around a black hole a few kilometers across that dwarfs a full-blown Kardashev 3 Galactic Empire in every possible respect, and that also regards the power output of a light bulb in the same way we do the entire Sun. 

Nor would each of these black holes necessarily host an entire civilization, they might opt to run smaller communities at a higher rate of subjective time, networked with other black hole communities to form a civilization. 

Time lag for communications between these is not too big a deal, since it might take light a thousand years to reach your nearest neighbor, but that might seem like normal conversational speed to you and them. 

A trillion, trillion years in the future you might be around a black hole somewhere chatting with a friend who was the same but thousands or millions of light years away, experiencing no more subjective lag between your environments then you do on the phone or in a chat room, presumably sharing some simulated environment. 

With subjective time slowed down so much, things like a galaxy spanning internet finally become possible even if you are still bound by the speed of light. 

That was what we discussed last time, as a reminder for those who saw that. 

But it gives us some questions. 

First, how can you possibly maintain your equipment for those kind of timelines with virtually no energy? 

Especially if there is proton decay. 

Second, what do you do afterwards? 

Is it all done then or can life go on? 

The answer to the second, if you can solve the first, is “Yes, kind of”. 

The biggest black holes can live almost 10^100 years. 

If you can somehow support yourself on that near infinitesimal trickle of power, you will notice it begins to rise near the end, and you will occasionally notice your neighboring civilizations around their own, smaller black holes surging up and eventually exploding. 

Near the end of life for any black hole, it will spike up to energy levels that are quite classically visible, for the last month it will be bright enough to light a whole planet, and in the end, nearly as bright as a star. 

That’s a lot of power to run one last big party off of to say good-bye, more than enough to re-simulate our modern civilization many trillions of times, but it’s also a nice chunk of energy to fuel something afterwards. 

That afterwards is our main interest today. 

Let’s discuss the maintenance issue real quick. 

We can’t build stuff that lasts more than a few years or decades nowadays, not when it comes to complex machinery, so trying to build stuff to last trillions of years with little to no maintenance sounds kind of absurd… and it certainly is in the context of our current technology, I don’t want to sugar-coat this problem. 

Yet we can potentially benefit again from slowing down time. 

Real time too, not just subjective time. 

We can slow down subjective time for thinking, by just running a computer slower, various decay processes still occur at the same rate. 

But time slows down as you get closer and closer to a black hole, and for the very largest black holes you can get quite close before being harmed by tidal forces. 

This lets you slow down the rate at which decay is occurring in chemical, mechanical, electronic, or even biological systems. 

Of course they are only going slow from an external view, in many ways a black hole is just an implosion taking place in a slowed down region of space so that it takes eons to witness. 

Again, it’s all about subjective time, but that’s all that truly matters in a Dark Universe where not much is happening. 

However, we have another big advantage from that dark and boring Universe. 

Damage and decay tend to be the result of external events, and your machinery wouldn’t experience a lot of erosion, oxidation, or decay when it exists in an empty void chilled down to a micro-Kelvin. 

You also have trillions of years to figure out how to build stuff for the long term. 

Not to mention all that time to figure out alternatives like jumping into another, younger universe, or tapping vacuum energy. 

You might just flat out learn how to violate energy conservation or tell entropy to take a hike. 

Solve any of those and you can have civilizations that last a very long time. 

Of course, one big problem with matter is that on these kind of timescales, just about everything has to be considered unstable and radioactive. 

Carbon-14, or radiocarbon, is very handy for radiocarbon dating because it only has a half life of about 6000 years. 

You wouldn’t want to build anything out of radiocarbon that you wanted to last millions of years because it will start turning into nitrogen on you. 

Many other substances, while we call them stable, still have half-lives that are long, but not infinite. 

This is made worse if proton decay occurs, but if it doesn’t, on long enough timelines, longer than even the black hole era, we do have to worry about all matter turning into iron, which we’ll get to later. 

Overall though, you just have to worry about slowly losing matter to unavoidable losses, be it collisions or evaporation or decays. 

It’s all fixable, but you need to be able to do it with virtually no energy, because you have virtually no power. 

Once again, time slows near black holes, so you might be able dance around the issue that way too. 

Now, we also have proton decay to consider. 

Under the Standard Model, protons last forever, but in some other models, they do decay somewhere in between 10^31 to 10^36 years or longer. 

Either of those are a near eternity compared to the Stellar Epoch of the Universe, but it’s shorter than any naturally occurring black hole would live, or even a small one with a dwarf planet’s mass instead of a star. 

This doesn’t change things too much if our civilization has mastered making black holes they can actually add matter to. 

They wouldn’t be able to use Hawking Radiation from bigger ones because they couldn’t exist that long without all their matter decaying, and would be limited to just using their rotational energy and artificial, smaller black holes. 

They still operate like the other black hole civilization, except they’d generally be trying to prevent black holes from forming naturally or merging. 

We may, however, be able to make further use of decaying protons, since protons are assumed to decay into pions that turns into gamma rays, a nice power source, and positrons. 

The positron is the antiparticle of the electron, and perhaps you could alter everything to run off Positronium instead. 

Positronium is a quasi atom composed of a positron and an electron orbiting each other, instead of an electron around a proton as in hydrogen. 

It is perhaps possible to build new types of molecules out of it, allowing you to continue on even with proton decay. 

In the normal model for the end of the Universe, things keep expanding forever with large clumps of matter bound together by gravity, and the rest all carried so far away they eventually redshift over the cosmological horizon. 

Best guess right now is that our own galaxy, and our nearest neighbors, will eventually merge into one big galaxy that will stay together and that’s it... that is, barring artificial intervention of sorts, which we’ll get to shortly. 

In this version of things, all matter eventually ends up in black holes, dead stars, or objects too small to naturally be either. 

We can live around those dead stars for a very long time too, but they eventually cool down into super-dense, super-cold objects with so much gravity we’d have a hard time mining them usefully. 

They will have another use for us later, however, in the formation of iron stars, but that takes a very long time even compared to the Black Hole Epoch. 

We can't be sure we have that much time though, and we have a theory called the Big Rip which might prevent us from even getting to the Black Hole Epoch, let alone the Iron Star Epoch. 

We don’t know much about what makes the Universe expand, other than that it appears to be accelerating, which is why we call the force doing this Dark Energy, we are not illuminated yet on what it is. 

You will have heard about a scenario where this accelerated expansion rips the entire universe to shreds in just 20 billion years. 

As an FYI, that period was calculated using an arbitrary round value for w, the relevant constant, of -1.5. 

We don’t know what its value is, just that it’s probably -1 or close to it, but if you plug in -1.5 you get about 20 billion years left, stick in -1 and you get infinity. 

There is no theory saying the Universe ends in 20 billion years; it was just an example in the original paper. 

If it were -2 in the example, it would be ten billion years, if it were -1.1, a hundred billion. 

But if this theory is right, and w is not exactly equal to -1, the force acting to expand the universe would eventually grow strong enough to override the gravitational force existing between all galaxies, then between all stars, then strong enough to override the gravity holding stars and planets together. 

Taken to its conclusion, it finally reaches a level powerful enough to override the electromagnetic forces binding molecules together, and eventually even nuclei themselves. 

However, the thing about quarks, and the strong nuclear force that binds them together, is that when you pull on two quarks, to rip them apart, you have to exert so much energy to do it that, that you actually end up spawning two new pairs of quarks, so you get this huge new outpouring of new matter everywhere. 

It’s a bit of a Hydra thing. 

Slice up a quark pair and get two more, that’s also one way to convert energy into matter. 

The theory gets a bit uncertain at that point since it operates under General Relativity, which is very iffy at the atomic scale, and of course our understanding of Dark Energy is not terribly precise or ironclad either. 

Right now it’s a bit of black box, we know what it does but not how it works or where it comes from, and we can't rule out that a better understanding of it might open a new energy source for us. 

See the Dark Energy episode for more discussion of it. 

Regardless of what happens when you get to the atomic unbinding stage, nothing would be around to witness it so it wouldn’t matter to you. 

If your scientists determine that it is the correct theory, you then figure out the actual timeline you have left and ration resources accordingly. 

If you’ve got 20 billion years you really have no reason to conserve anything. 

I’ve heard folks suggest you could make a very large black hole and tuck your civilization inside it for protection, but I’ve also heard the Big Rip takes out black holes too. 

I’d say a cosmologist could provide a better answer, but we have no proper theory for quantum gravity, so it’s probably a guessing game right now anyway. 

That end expansion is very fast too, so you wouldn’t duck inside a black hole to buy a little more time or anything. 

Assuming the Big Rip isn’t the case though, civilizations looking at real long term solutions, probably want to conserve matter and energy as much as they can, and probably hoard it from wherever they can. 

It stands to reason, that if you are planning to keep your civilization around as long as you can, you will start hoarding matter so that it doesn’t get burnt up uselessly in stars or fall into black holes bigger than you want or get ejected out of the galaxy. 

This is one of the reasons we say in the Dyson Dilemma that civilizations that don’t want to expand their numbers might seem to expand anyway, as they journey outwards not to colonize other solar systems, but to stockpile their matter instead. 

Like squirrels hoarding nuts because winter is coming. 

Big stars do make valuable heavy elements, but supernovae are not efficient methods for that, and odds are civilizations that want more of those would prefer to use a giant particle accelerator instead, as we discussed in last week’s Dyson Spheres episode. 

I also mentioned there that it is possible to move planets or stars. 

However, it is also possible to move galaxies. 

In all of these cases, the method isn’t high tech, just very big. 

The Great Wall or Pyramids were huge tasks, but hardly high tech. 

While technology can possibly make it much easier to do, or offer you other methods, fundamentally it’s not complicated, just an application of the maxim “if brute force isn’t working, you’re not using enough of it.” If you don’t mind waiting a billion years, you can place a ton of thin mirrors near a star and have them bounce the light in one direction, accelerating them up to quite high speeds, as explained in the Shkadov Thrusters episode. 

You can accelerate that process by using the methods we discussed in star lifting to spew out increased amounts of solar wind, like a rocket engine flame. 

Do this to a galaxy’s worth of stars and their own gravity will bring that galaxy along. 

We will discuss this more in the future, but the summary form is that you are not limited to your galaxy’s resources alone, or even to those of the dozen or so near enough not to be pulled apart from us by the expanding Universe. 

I am frequently asked how far outwards I think we could ever hope to colonize, and the answer is it depends on how fast your ships can go. 

You’ve probably heard of Hubble’s Constant, usually measured at about 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. 

I try to avoid using parsecs on the channel so it is about 20 kilometers per second per mega light year, or 2 centimeters per second per light year, whichever you find easier. 

That’s how fast something is traveling away from us, from all the space emerging from every point in between us and it, as the Universe expands. 

So a billion light years away would be 20,000 kilometers per second, which is about 7% of light speed. 

You need a ship that can go at least that fast to reach a galaxy that far, far away. 

I generally place this as the practical point of expansion, since I figure you will eventually run into someone else who would appreciate you not setting up shop in their galaxy, even if they don’t exist yet. 

Leave now on a billion-light year journey, and when you arrive, a planet that was just forming when you left might be the capital of an interstellar empire. 

And while intergalactic warfare is at least vaguely plausible in a no-FTL universe, inter-supercluster warfare really is not. 

You could also get a galaxy to move at this speed back toward you, but probably not much faster, so the million or so nearest galaxies closer than about a billion light years from us is probably all the mass available to a civilization. 

We’ll go with the rounded value of 10^48 kilograms, keep that in mind for later, but that’s more or less your upper limit, and it could be steered into a pretty compact volume not much larger than our galaxy. 

Any tighter than that and the combined mass would form a galaxy-sized black hole. 

Some of that matter, however much you hoarded, would be acting as fuel. 

Indeed, it probably almost all of it would, eventually, but we can assume a lot of it would be used for making computers and memory. 

The processing power permitted under classical computing, when temperature is your true upper limit and you’ve got solar systems worth of mass to build your computers out of, is mind-boggling, but we have some options that might let us squeeze even more calculations or simulations out of a small amount of energy. 

We talked about Quantum Computing earlier this year, and tried to dispel some of the myths about it which elevate it beyond a very powerful tool into almost magical status, and at some point we’ll need to do the same for Time Crystals, but, unsurprisingly, a lot of folks have wondered if these options let you blow past even the titanic processors allowed under classic computing, or potentially do entropy-free calculation, Reversible Computing. 

Last time, we discussed how Landauer’s Limit on conventional computing is based on temperature. 

It is a hard physical limit that tells us that no matter how much we improve computing we can’t beat that. 

Not with conventional computing at least. 

As I said in the Quantum Computing episode, we never want to regard that technology as a magic wand, and it is way too new for us to discuss it reliably. 

That’s even more true for Reversible Computing, specifically physically reversible or isentropic computing, where you could do all your calculations essentially energy free by undoing the process afterwards. 

This is usually thought to be impossible and actually where Landauer’s Principle derives from. 

But we’re not sure it actually is physically impossible. 

There are some reasons to think otherwise, and trillions of years is a long time to figure out how to do it or get close to it. 

If that turned out to be possible though, it turns out we have another limit, of a different kind, that controls the speed we can reverse calculations at. 

This derives from the Margolus–Levitin theorem that shows that even reversible computing and quantum computing are fundamentally limited to no more than 6x10^33 operations per second per joule. 

The more physics savvy of you might have just twitched. 

Yes, that was seconds per joule, not joules per second. 

It is saying that, if you can keep using the same energy to run computations constantly, that this is the maximum speed you can run them at. 

Converting that into matter, at about 10^17 joules per kilogram, and dividing by our usual assumption of about 10^16 Hz of processing to emulate a human brain, we get 6x10^34 people being simulated per kilogram of matter… which was about the same as what we got from a full-blown solar system spanning Matrioshka Brain, an MB, and which would conveniently fit in your pocket rather than an entire solar system. 

If you saw the episode on Matrioshka Brains, you might recall that it could hold more emulated minds than an entire K3 civilization could. 

As a reminder, a K3 civilization is one that hasn’t just populated every solar system in a galaxy, but also turned them all into Dyson Spheres. 

Now since this presumably does not need energy to run on, or rather doesn’t expend any, our 1 kilogram pocket MB could just sit there emulating billions of trillions of trillions of humans forever, enough to normally populate an entire supercluster of galaxies converted into Dyson swarms. 

One eternal engine of thought for one kilogram of mass-energy. 

Earlier I mentioned we could possibly get our hands on as much as a supercluster of mass, 10^48 kilograms, a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion kilograms. 

At this sort of scale numbers start feeling a bit meaningless, but you’d be talking about a potential real-time population of 10^83 people, more if you either run them slower or can get that processing figure per person down. 

That is more people than there are atoms in the Observable Universe. 

You can add on 5 more orders of magnitude if you want to assume the entire Observable Universe was converted, not just the matter in the nearest billion light years, or knock 5 or 6 off if you want to limit it to the galaxy. 

We don’t know that such a thing is possible, but that is the hard limit for that in much the same way Landauer’s Limit is way beyond what we can do now with computers. 

It represents a hard limit on what we can do conventionally. 

I get asked about reversible and quantum computing a lot after the original episode, so I wanted to address the option. 

We do have to wonder what such a computer would be used for, the obvious being to keep running simulations of people, digital consciousnesses. 

Though an alternative is to devote all that processing power to trying learn how to break the Laws of Thermodynamics and reverse entropy, a very important question for any civilization that wants to live forever, and the Last Question you’ll probably be asking, if you want to see the other side of Eternity. 

Keeping to more classic views of computing and the Universe though, we still have options for surviving the Black Hole Epoch. 

Once those all die, and basically explode (it’s always good to remember that’s how that goes down) all the Universe is a frozen, desolate, void of gas at near vacuum levels and a few leftover dead stars or planets. 

If you were some civilization that spent the last 10^100 years living around a leftover galactic core black hole, and the last trillion or so of it living around the much smaller and more energetic one it became, storing up that energy, you’d have noticed the occasional object drifting around that was just a bit warmer than the background temperature of the Universe. 

You’ll know that these used to be neutron stars or white dwarfs that long since cooled off, but haven’t cooled off completely. 

You recognize one as good old Sol, our home star, long since turned red giant, then white dwarf and, finally, black dwarf. 

Nobody ever disassembled it or shoved it into a black hole for fuel, because it was our home. 

It gave us life back at the dawn of time and we will return to it now, at the end of time, to let it give us life once more. 

The reason it is just the barest degree warmer than the Universe around is that inside, incredibly slowly even compared to black hole timelines, particles are slowly transmuting into iron and releasing a little energy when they do this. 

Iron is the last stopover point for matter. 

Heavier matter eventually decays into it and lighter matter fuses up into it. 

This happens superfast in big stars, but here, in our dead Sun, it occurs over time periods of 10^1500 years. 

And every time such a transformation occurs, a little energy is released. 

How a civilization would possibly tap such tiny amounts of power, let alone maintain their equipment while doing this, is beyond me. 

Even doing it for the Hawking Radiation of a normal solar mass black hole pushes plausibility. 

Yet, at least on paper, under known physics, it is conceivable. 

If they can somehow gain power out of this tiny, Earth-sized remnant, and operate computers off it, they can keep going, they can continue to exist on this Iron Star for timelines that look at the whole prior Universe, even the Black Hole Epoch, as so much less than an eyeblink. 

And we’re still not done yet. 

Once this white dwarf turned black dwarf slowly mutates into a pure iron star, it still will not have reached its lowest energy level. 

That Iron Star will eventually collapse into a neutron star, at an estimated timeline of 10^10^76 years, coincidentally almost the same as the 10^10^77 possible unique states for the Universe, or total alternate Universes, that we discussed in Infinite Improbability Issues. 

A very great deal of energy will be released when that collapse from Iron Star to Neutron Star occurs. 

This means even more lifetime for those there, if they have somehow survived that long. 

Alternatively, Iron Stars might turn into Black holes even sooner, a mere 10^10^26 years, and you restart yourself. 

That black hole that forms, being of less than one solar mass, will once more give off only a trickle of energy, but it would seem like a banquet feast compared to what you were used to back in the Black Hole Epoch. 

Finally though, it will end, after another near eternal golden age. 

It slowly rises in power, until it gives off its last gasps, shining nearly as brightly as the stars that disappeared so long ago, and then that is essentially it. 

If you haven’t figured out how to keep going in the face of entropy by now, it is too late, but you will get that final second Black Hole Epoch, or Neutron Star Epoch, depending on how the physics of that works out. 

And yet, it is not necessarily the end of intelligence, even if it is the end of civilization. 

If matter is required to store information, and you’ve been accumulating so much of it, you’ve probably also been discarding extra bits to keep going a while longer. 

If the Sun went out, you could stay alive a while longer by tossing your furniture and books into the fireplace, and while you might not be able to bring yourself to toss your favorite book into the fire to buy a few more minutes, all sorts of old manuals and reference books might find themselves in there. 

Odds are pretty good such civilizations would do the same, maybe trading every memory for a little more time, maybe just old tax returns and astronomical tables sacrificed to live a while longer. 

In the end, they go, sooner rather than later if they want to keep a lot, but they can keep some in reserve almost to the end, because the power levels will rise for a black hole near the end, or for the collapse of an iron star to a neutron star. 

Either way, this is when time, as any meaningful measure, has truly come to an end, Eternity has come and gone and taken with it any civilizations and their records. 

But again, not necessarily intelligence. 

We call it the Heat Death of the Universe, even though it is terribly cold, because everything is in thermal equilibrium, there is no longer any source for energy. 

Entropy and the Laws of Thermodynamics have finally closed the book on things. 

Yet inside that random chaos it is possible for occasional bits of order to emerge. 

If I take a deck of cards and put it in order, then shuffle it, it becomes disordered, more and more every time I shuffle it. 

But if I do that enough times it will return to its original state. 

It could happen at anytime, but, on average, for a 52 card deck, it should take approximately 52-factorial shuffles, or 52 times 51 times 50 times 49 etc all the way down to 1. 

In this case, if I shuffled that deck once every second, I should expect to reset it in about 10^60 years. 

This may seem an impossibly long time period, but on the timelines we have been looking at today, that’s actually rather modest. 

Were I to use only one suit of cards, just 13 cards, in order from Ace to King, that would be more like 200 years, something which you might see in your own lifetime of shuffling. 

Likewise, if I used a larger deck it would take far longer. 

Back in Ludwig Boltzmann’s day, we knew about entropy, but thought the Universe was steady state. 

In a closed system like that, no matter how big it is, just like shuffling a deck of enormous cards, eventually your particles all reset, and will reset to something close enough far sooner. 

When all is chaos and random action, even processes which normally build up entropy become effectively reversible, so long as there is a finite chance of them occurring. 

And in the Infinite Improbabilities episode, we discussed all the weird things that can happen when we begin giving incredibly tiny yet still finite odds near infinite time or space to work in. 

One of those weird things is the Boltzmann Brain, that even in a Universe reduced to total entropy, out of that chaos will emerge a random pattern of matter that is a thinking creature. 

Everything is bumping around chaotically and just happens to create a random pattern that is, for instance, a big sentient supercomputer with a nice nuclear reactor attached to it to run it until components or fuel decays. 

Perhaps even a nice habitat with plants inside it, with a person to eat them... a little Eden if you will. 

After eternity, in this frigid random soup, these minds could just keep popping up. 

We do not live in a steady state universe, ours is expanding, so we are pretty much guaranteed no total resets of entropy, but Boltzmann Brains can exist and, indeed, can come to be in other Universes where the physical constants might have values that normally preclude life, or even simple chemistry, from occurring. 

Indeed, in some universes, they’d probably be the only kind of life that could exist. 

Over an infinite period of time, anything that can happen will happen, including a stable and long-lasting Boltzmann Brain, which might sit around contemplating ways to deal with entropy. 

Such an entity would not remember us, though. 

It would not know or remember that there ever was a Universe beyond the frozen sea of chaos all around it, but it would be alive and thinking. 

And since, if one can exist, there is an even smaller chance two could exist near each other in time and space, or three or more, we do have a chance for a Civilization after the End of Time. 

… And you only need a chance... 

This is as far as we go looking into the future, so while we might do some more episodes on Civilizations at the End of Time, they’ll have to be prequels, not sequels. 

Time can’t really be said to have an end, and, in a lot of ways, we aren’t talking about the end of time, but our general fight against entropy itself. 

It’s a long, drawn out war, with a lot of battles along the way, even before the death of our own sun, which, as we’ve seen in this series, is more of a prologue than epilogue to civilization. 

I mentioned near the beginning that the episode was dedicated to Asimov and his short story “The Last Question”, which is focused on that theme and is generally voted his best short story. 

It starts off in modern times and rolls all the way on to the end of things, charting Asimov’s vision for the future of humanity. 

It’s been adapted a number of times, including a performance by Leonard Nimoy, and has also shown up in five or six Asimov short story anthologies. 

Even 60 years later, the story manages to talk about computers and the future in surprisingly accurate ways and, where it misses the boat, it highlights how new we are to this technology and how much room to improve it we have in the the very long time we have before the stars start going dark. 

As the channel approached 100,000 subscribers we had a lot of comments and jokes about how we might get a sponsor, and, as some of you might recall, I said I probably wouldn’t accept one, unless it came from someone like Maxwell House, Starbucks, or Audible. 

I am a very big audio book addict and have been since I was a kid, and I’m usually listening to one when writing or editing these episodes. 

As it turns out, Audible approached me a couple weeks back and offered a sponsorship, essentially on the grounds that we already talk about science fiction novels a lot anyway, so it was a pretty natural fit and, as a long time customer of theirs, I’m glad to welcome them on board as a sponsor. 

I’d already written this draft of this script and talked about “The Last Question” in it, so, starting off by recommending my favorite short story by my namesake, Isaac Asimov, seemed very appropriate. 

That short story is available on Audible by itself, or in the anthology “Robot Dreams”, and you can pick up a free copy today - just use my link, audible.com/isaac, or click on the link in the description below, to get a FREE audiobook and 30 day trial, That’s audible dot com slash I_S_A_A_C. 

I’m certain you will enjoy that story, but if not, you can swap it out for free for any other book at anytime, and it’s yours to keep whether you stay subscribed to Audible or not. 

Next week, we will be returning to the Fermi Paradox Great Filters Series to look at possible conditions that might make life on Earth-like planets a lot less likely than we tend to think, in Rare Earth. 

The week after that, we will take a look at the concept of Force Fields, and see if there are any realistic options for that under known science, as well as discuss some under-explored uses and applications for such technology, if you’ve got it. 

For alerts when those and other episodes come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel, and if you enjoyed this episode, hit the like button, and share it with others. 

Until next time, thanks for watching, and have a great week.

Megastructures 1.1: Dyson Spheres
---
  
2017-07-06  
https://youtu.be/HlmKejRSVd8  

---

Our galaxy is an enormous place with billions of stars and doubtless billions of potentially habitable planets. 

Yet a single Dyson Sphere contains as much living space as all of those planets combined. 

So today we are talking about Dyson Spheres, giant constructs designed to take advantage of all the light produced by a star. 

This should be fairly familiar ground for anyone who is a regular to the channel, as we do talk about them a lot. 

We’ve talked about them in terms of the Fermi Paradox, in the Dyson Dilemma. 

We’ve talked about them as the basis for what are known as Kardashev 2 civilizations in the Kardashev Scale episode. 

We’ve talked about their individual components in terms of other megastructures like rotating habitats and orbital rings. 

We’ve talked about special purposes they can be put to, like moving a star via a Shkadov Thruster, or using one to toast planets thousands of light years away in the Nicoll-Dyson Beams episode. 

But we’ve never sat down and discussed it in a dedicated fashion, and we’ll do that today. 

One peculiar aspect of Dyson Spheres is that they don’t make too many appearances in science fiction, especially Film or TV, even though they are often considered a near-inevitable path that advanced civilizations would pursue, for reasons we’ll get to shortly. 

Part of that avoidance in fiction is probably their sheer scale. 

These things are immense, and would dwarf Earth the way Earth dwarfs a small village. 

More in fact, a classic Dyson Sphere outfitted for human habitation is so large that if you randomly scattered every living human around one, they’d each have their own continent to themselves. 

On the other hand, most fictional planets tend to be shown to us as not much more than one town simply because a fully populated planet is already a thing of overwhelming scope, and a Dyson Sphere that much more so. 

They are so big that even if you only gave one-page summary atlas entry on every continent sized area of one, it would require several million books and several thousand years to read. 

We are going to try to wrap our heads around some of that immensity today, but to do that, let’s start with the basic concept. 

All life on this planet is fundamentally powered by the Sun, with only a tiny amount of our planetary energy budget deriving from geothermal energy provided by our molten core or the tidal heating the Moon generates while orbiting us. 

That sunlight provides an incredible amount of energy, approximately 174 thousand, trillion watts of power, or 174,000 Terawatts. 

Our own energy needs in terms of electricity are about a percent of a percent of that. 

We do consume a lot of energy, but it’s nothing compared to what the planet receives constantly, though of course we use a lot of that indirectly to power our biosphere and heat our homes. 

A lot of that light is wasted, bouncing back into space or hitting barren land or sea. 

Even what little actually hits photosynthetic plants goes mostly unused, and while it does help us stay warm, it could do that just as well even if we used for other productive purposes first. 

Whether you plug in a light bulb or TV or laptop or space heater, all that energy ends as heat, which is an important point to remember for later. 

A lot of energy hits Earth, and a lot is reflected away or blocked by clouds, plus any land devoted to solar power panels is land you can’t use for something else. 

So folks often discuss the idea of putting solar panels in orbit and beaming that energy down. 

That’s an ample and nigh inexhaustible supply too; but as tremendous as the amount of energy hitting our planet is the Sun itself produces over 2.2 billion times the light that hits Earth and a quadrillion times what we use to run our technology and civilization. 

You can kind of guess where this is going, except that ‘where this is going’ seems to vary from person to person. 

What fiction tends to reference is a big solid spherical shell where people live on the inside, but that is not what Freeman Dyson, for whom the object is named, actually had in mind. 

In fact, he wasn’t thinking of an object at all... and it’s also never what I’m referring to on the channel either. 

Such a construct is virtually impossible to build, especially if you don’t have some form of artificial gravity available, but there are other ways and we’ll discuss them later. 

The original Dyson Sphere, typically known as a Dyson Swarm nowadays (just to avoid any confusion), is really just a giant cloud of objects orbiting a star, thickly enough to obstruct most or all of a star’s light. 

It’s easier to think of it as a solid spherical shell when contemplating the numbers. 

Such a sphere would generally have a radius of Earth’s distance from the sun, 1.5 x 10^8 kilometers, and an area of 2.8 x 10^17 square kilometers. 

In terms of Earth, that is just over half a billion times the area, but it is actually 2.2 billion times as much area, because the Earth receives an amount of sunlight based on its cross-section to the Sun, Pi times the planet’s radius squared, but has a surface area of 4 Pi R-squared. 

Only half the planet is lit at any time and most of it is angled off from the sun, not perpendicular to its light. 

If the swarm was composed entirely of O’Neill Cylinders, large rotating habitats 4 kilometers in radius and 20 kilometers long, with an internal area of 800 square kilometers, it would contain 350 trillion of them. 

An O’Neill cylinder is about as big as we can safely build a rotating habitat with modern materials, and such a habitat might be sparsely populated, a dedicated nature preserve, or home to millions. 

Also, while their rotation mimics gravity internally, they have virtually no real external gravity. 

This means you could easily position hundreds of them right near each other bound together by cables for vacuum trains, or even long, thin pressurized corridor-habitats just thick enough to offer comfortable spin-gravity to the traffic inside. 

These habitats, along with thin mirrors and solar panels to help supply them with light and electricity, tend to be considered the default constituents of a Dyson Sphere. 

Now as I mentioned, you can connect them, and indeed likely would, more on that in a moment, but let’s assume each was on its own elliptical trajectory around the Sun. 

Now these are not planets, so they can maintain temperature easier, twisting to expose more or less surface to the sun, or maneuvering solar shades or mirrors to block light or add more, so they do not need to be on anything like a normal Earth Distance, they could be as close as Mercury or as far as Mars with no serious impediment to maintaining their function or climate. 

But if we assume for the moment they have to stick to within a 25 million kilometer zone, closer or further, than Earth’s average distance of 150 million kilometers from the Sun, the volume these habitats are inside would be about 10^25 cubic kilometers. 

Whereas each cylinder has 1600 cubic kilometers of volume, with some more space for various external attachments, and with 350 trillion of them that would be close to a quintillion cubic kilometers or 10^18, one-ten millionth of the total volume. 

These are all constantly moving, but if we took a quick snapshot of the system, on average each habitat would occupy a cube 3000 kilometers or 2000 miles to a side, with them at the center all by themselves. 

The system is essentially opaque, not because it is densely packed, but because it is so thick, much as fog or clouds are. 

Much as galaxies appear quite thick and hard to see through, even though stars are separated by distances even larger than Dyson Spheres. 

So collisions are not an issue because they are not close to each other at all. 

Folks tend to assume the various components are constantly in danger of slamming together because they are picturing something that is densely packed, but they aren’t. 

Additionally, there are three things you can do with access to that much energy. 

You can power lots of radar, lots of computers, and lots of light-beam propulsion. 

So they have no problem tracking each other, predicting trajectories, and making sure collisions don’t happen. 

They can also vaporize any debris that wanders their way. 

A fourth thing they can do is run giant clocks. 

I get asked a lot in terms of the Fermi Paradox if one would actually expect big civilizations to do a lot of omnidirectional broadcasts, and the answer is no. 

Even with access to tons of power you don’t waste it, particularly since there are only so many frequencies to broadcast on, so you do a lot of tight-beam communication, over actual wires or using lasers, and probably encrypted or compressed. 

But the one thing you would probably still broadcast in a loud and omnidirectional fashion is your positioning system. 

Everybody needs to know where they are and where everyone else is, not just your hundreds of trillions of habitats, but all your ships and smaller facilities as well. 

So you’d want to have a few channels devoted to just barking out the time and date constantly just like Earth’s GPS system does. 

This is not absolutely necessary, but it is the most logical approach, and while a Dyson can be a single mega-civilization with a unified government, or trillions of separate individual nations of one or more habitats, that’s one cooperative treaty that probably would raise little objection in being passed or enforced. 

Not that stuff would start slamming into each other if they did not, in all probability each habitat would be quite capable of tracking all of its trillions of neighbors, and at most need to coordinate with a handful of others for total vision and tracking. 

But it saves a lot of resources if everyone is coordinating on an agreed upon system of what to do if two habitats are on an intersecting trajectory. 

This also answers the regular question of who would build such a thing, considering the time and resources needed, because you just build new components in open orbits as needed or wanted over time. 

You might build one over a decade or over the span of a million years, depending on your needs and capabilities, but you do have some reasons to build it faster than your population grows, more on that in a bit. 

As I said, they could be all scattered out, but generally probably will not be. 

A given orbital path, be it a circle or ellipse, can be thought of as a solid ring a habitat moves along. 

You can put many other habitats on that same ring, and travel between those on that ring becomes incredibly easy, indeed you can make a solid ring too. 

Those familiar with Larry Niven’s Ringworld probably know that as a partial-Dyson, and also know it’s inherently unstable and has to spin so fast that no known material could handle the strain. 

If you did happen to have such a super-material, you could enclose a star by just making several of them, each cocked at a different angle. 

However, those rings have to spin fast, and are unstable, because they are trying to simulate gravity via centrifugal force. 

The bigger an object is in terms of radius, the more quickly it must spin, and the more force it must endure to produce the same amount of spin-gravity. 

But you can just run a wire right around a planet or star in a big loop and it just orbits, that’s not super-stable, but it’s decently stable and easily corrected. 

Indeed, that’s the basis of the Orbital Ring we discussed last week, and as I mentioned at the time, you could super-size those to run around stars, not just planets. 

We have a type of Megastructure called a Rung World, which is like a Ring World but looks more like a ladder wrapped around in a circle, in this case around the sun. 

The individual rungs of the ladder are rotating habitats, each connected in that circle by either a cable or even a full blown one-loop Topopolis, a kind of super-long thin rotating habitat we’ve discussed in passing before. 

Such a Rungworld might be a series of a million O’Neill Cylinders connected by a pair of cables, one used for clockwise movement between rungs, the other counterclockwise perhaps. 

Or it might be even more upscaled, if you have bulk graphene manufacture, and be two Topopolises connected by thousands of McKendree Cylinders acting as rungs. 

It depends on your level of technology. 

Obviously, if you can bulk produce high-quality graphene, it lets you make much bigger habitats; and carbon -- what graphene is made of -- is a lot more plentiful than iron or titanium, the two things we usually envision making rotating habitats from. 

And whereas an O’Neill cylinder is basically a decently sized island, populated by hundreds of thousands, a McKendree cylinder is a continent-class megastructure that could comfortably house a billion people. 

They do not need to be connected, but this allows for easy and cheap travel, as well as dedicated transmission lines for power and high-bandwidth communications among other things. 

These, rather than the cloud format, are probably your more logical ‘basic subdivision’ of a Dyson Sphere. 

In the general swarm your neighbors might be changing a lot, here however, your neighbors remain in the same position on that ring. 

That would give you a lot more throw-weight in local disagreements too, it takes several million O’Neill Cylinder Rungworlds to enclose a star, or several thousand McKendree Rungworlds, but even for the smaller one, it is probably better to be one of millions of larger entities than one of a few hundred trillion lone habitats. 

I usually refer to these entities as Ladder States, I’m only guessing by assuming these might ever exist, but whether or not they do, it makes it easier to contemplate the internal workings of a Dyson Sphere. 

As I said, the scale of these things boggles the mind, so anything that makes them easier to wrap your mind around helps. 

Now one hardly has to jam-pack these things with people, but keeping to modern human densities we’d expect the average O’Neill Ladder State to have a population of around a trillion, and a McKendree Ladder State to be more like 100 trillion to a quadrillion. 

Don’t think of these as local super-powers either, compared to a full Dyson sphere, even a McKendree Ladder State is essentially a micro-nation. 

Next to each ring or ladder state would be two more, one a little closer and one a little further from the Sun, cocked at an angle, probably a small one too, so they didn’t have much relative motion to their neighbors when intersecting them. 

Each subsequent ring is tilted a little more and you wrap around to enclose a star. 

The individual rungs could be nearly touching their neighbors or could be spaced out with solar panels and smaller facilities in between. 

Now the question always becomes where do you get the material for all of this, and by default the assumption is that you disassemble the planets to do it, but you don’t actually have to, there are other ways to get the necessary material, as we’ll discuss in a few minutes. 

Those planets also can cause a lot of orbital perturbations in your Dyson Swarm, but those can also be managed. 

There are basically two ways you can start a Dyson off, and both could occur simultaneously. 

The first is to begin near Earth, basically building a cloud of habitats around the planet, the ‘Planet Cloud’ I’ve discussed before, and begin extending that out from Earth as a first ring. 

Earth is pretty massive so you’ve got issues with it pulling elements on the ring toward itself, but this is manageable. 

Indeed, if you’ve got bulk graphene production, and orbital rings and space towers, you can actually include Earth as a rung itself and use active support to push nearer rungs away to neutralize gravitational attraction. 

Subsequent rings might spawn from other planets like Mars or Venus, as they were terraformed, or just near Earth, again at an angle. 

These rings can be pretty wide too. 

The further you get from the actual line of orbit, the more the material is pulled toward a different orbit. 

But that can be a pretty big distance even before conventional materials can’t handle the strain, and materials like carbon nanotubes or active support members widen that a lot more. 

Nor do the rungs need to be tilted perpendicular to the sun, they could parallel sunlight or be cocked onto the orbital path and you can get away with structures that are more three dimensional than just a ladder wrapped in a circle. 

Your other starting point is near the Sun. 

Mercury is not classically terraformable, we can para-terraform it, but it is usually considered a far better candidate for raw materials. 

To create an entire sphere of mirrors and solar panels around the Sun requires not even a percent of Mercury’s mass, hopefully less since ideally a power-focused early Dyson would actually be composed of power statites, not power satellites, and those have to be quite thin. 

A Statite, which is short for Static Satellite, is a type of simple active-support structure. 

It is a very thin object light enough to float over the Sun. 

It is pushed away by solar radiation equal but opposite to the pull of gravity. 

Essentially like floating a sheet of paper over an air vent, or a heavy version of a solar sail. 

Since both the outward force of the sun’s light and the pull of gravity decrease with square of distance from the Sun, a statite functions the same at any distance from the Sun, and each star has a specific density a statite must have to float. 

Too light and it blows away, too heavy and it falls into the star. 

Interestingly, the bigger stars permit heavier statites because while they have more gravity than smaller stars, they also produce vastly more light. 

A star twice as massive has twice the gravitational force, but will be at least ten times as bright. 

Also, statites can make use of solar wind to increase the mass they can carry, and one can combine normal orbital methods with these to produce something I call a Lagite, or lagging satellite, one that orbits slower than normal by combining the solar push with normal orbital mechanics, allowing decently heavier objects to orbit at a desired speed rather than the natural one. 

The exact mass density will vary from star to star, but for ours it is 0.78 grams per square meter, thicker and it falls down, lighter and it flies away. 

Built at Earth’s distance, a shell of statites around the whole Sun would mass 2.2 x 10^20 kilograms, which sounds like a lot but Earth itself is 27,000 times as massive. 

Nor does it need to be that big, it’s just mirrors so you could build it much closer to the sun, smaller shell, less mass. 

Now such panels would not just be thin mirrors, you want to be able to expand or contract them a little, or turn them at angles, as the Sun does not produce exactly the same light all the time, so they’d probably be thin films with some wires, a small computer, and counterbalance or gyro, so that you can adjust their size, position, and attitude. 

This makes them all able to maneuver too, or tilt briefly out of the way to let sunlight pass through to hit Earth for instance, as it passed behind one. 

This setup is preferable to a single massive thin film, though that is one way to make a classic single piece Dyson Spherical Shell. 

So we now have a tons of power collectors around the Sun, without having to totally disassemble even Mercury. 

This brings up the question of “what do you do with all that power?” Which is different than “what do you do with all that space?” I consider the answer to the latter, “what do you do with two billion times the living area of Earth?” to be rather obvious. 

All that power though is another animal. 

You can’t beam it back to Earth, it would blow the planet up, and indeed we did an episode discussing weaponizing a Dyson Sphere, a construct known as a Nicoll-Dyson Beam. 

So you have a huge amount of power, what do you use it for? 

We have a lot of options. 

If you’ve managed to design solid gamma ray lasers, GRASERS, you ought to be able to create small artificial black holes by firing tons of them at the same spot, something known as a Kugelblitz black hole, which make amazing batteries able to hold energy for trillions of years or more, or power starships capable of moving at a decent fraction of light speed, or powering space stations and habitats far from the Sun. 

That’s pretty high-tech, but does seem permissible under known physics if anyone can figure out a way to reflect gamma rays the way we reflect normal light. 

You can also use all that energy to power miniaturized Nicoll-Dyson Beams to push even very large ships to interstellar velocities or around your own solar system, as we discussed in the Interstellar Highways episode. 

Either way, the creation of such a power-only Dyson, even just a partial one gathering less than a percent of a percent of the Sun’s light, makes you an interstellar civilization, no new technology required. 

We can also use that power to run a Star Lifting process, we did a whole episode on that, but to quickly recap, the Sun contains more matter by far than everything in the solar system combined, and that includes heavier materials like carbon and iron. 

There are thousands of Earth’s worth of such materials in the Sun, and they are all over the Sun, not just buried in the core. 

Extracting those is quite the Herculean endeavor, but is not super high-tech, and the Sun itself powers the extraction process. 

See that episode for details, but that is one way to get the material you need for a more robust Dyson, without disassembling planets. 

You only have to extract from planets, asteroids, and moons what you need to get started. 

The other option is to make the heavier elements out of lighter ones. 

We have been researching fusion for some time now and we talk a lot about how much of a game changer practical commercial fusion would be for our civilization. 

But it doesn’t render a Dyson Sphere redundant, nor do you need it to make one or to transmute materials. 

When you fuse lighter elements, like hydrogen or helium, into heavier ones like carbon or oxygen, you release a lot of energy. 

Our problem isn’t doing this, fusion is actually quite simple, it is doing it without needing something as big as a star and breaking even. 

Right now we have to pour more energy into matter than we get out of it if we want to fuse lighter elements into heavier elements. 

Such a civilization might just have fusion reactors robust enough to not only fuse deuterium, but also go as far up the chain as iron and get a massive surplus of energy out of it. 

If they can’t do that, then they can opt to use that huge surplus of power from their thin early Dyson to power huge particle accelerators that run at a deficit but produce heavier elements. 

Again, not high tech, just massive. 

So by this technique or by starlifting you can get the necessary heavier elements to build a bigger, thicker Dyson. 

Indeed, any star, even one with no planets locally, just maybe a few rocks to start the process, can be made into an optimum Dyson. 

The material needed for any Dyson is related to the total luminosity or power of the star it surrounds, twice as bright, twice the material to enclose it. 

If you are plucking matter from a sun and it’s not enough for your purposes, you just keep transmuting more hydrogen and helium into heavier elements, drawn from that sun, and its brightness begins to go down, decreasing the amount of material you need for full enclosure, until you hit the optimum balance. 

You can even arrange to leave planets in orbit around it unaffected by having your various power collectors or habitats tilt out of the way when they’d block it, or have some mirrors rotate to focus more light on it, keeping that planet to its normal daylight levels. 

So you could go build one around an alien system where intelligent critters are just thinking about how handy fire is, and when they developed real technology, you could just offer them the Dyson as a gift and effective back rent. 

You’ve already gotten million of years of use out of it, and if you did have the ability to make Kugelblitz black holes, you’d probably just build a small power collector Dyson to store that energy up and carry it home. 

You can also use this technique to take very large stars and lower their mass until they won’t go Supernova, thus killing off any nearby life, and walk away from that with several million planets worth of heavy matter for construction elsewhere as a reward for your good deeds. 

It’s much more efficient getting heavy elements this way too, rather than the essentially tiny amount that normally forms planets. 

A Supernova scatters matter out in every direction, with much of it remaining behind, trapped in the neutron star or black hole remnant. 

Of what remains, and reaches proto-solar systems forming, only a small fraction will end as a rocky planet with more of it buried inside gas giants and even more inside the new sun. 

In which case you have to star lift it out, which is hardly easy. 

See the Star Lifting episode for more details on that and other applications of that technology. 

Now I am generally of the opinion that any given Dyson will be a multi-task device, but there are a few types that are purpose built, a couple of which we’ve discussed in more detail elsewhere. 

The first is an obvious one, massive collections of rotating habitats for living area, or non-rotating ones if you’ve either adapted to zero-gravity or invented artificial gravity. 

If the latter, you can actually build a classic Dyson Shell, and use seriously upscaled orbital rings to keep it rigid. 

You’d probably include solar panels nearer in to power those active support rings keeping it rigid and maneuver thrusters to keep it from meandering off. 

Thus allowing you to have night time too, since again the shell, by default, experiences constant noontime light. 

It also has no gravity. 

No spherical shell -- no matter how massive -- generates any net gravity inside it, not at the middle, not at the edges, that’s just how the symmetry of spherical shells works. 

So everything would fall into the sun if you don’t have some sort of artificial gravity. 

In Niven’s Ringworld we get this by taking a slice, a thick ring of a Dyson, and spinning it very fast. 

This doesn’t work with a Sphere though; since besides needing impossibly strong materials, the poles will still experience no gravity and only at the equator would you have full gravity. 

That’s actually okay if you just want a partial Dyson and don’t mind gravity being weaker at some places and stronger near the equator, you can still float a huge statite power collector over both poles. 

If you really want a rigid Dyson you can walk around, but had no artificial gravity, you would make such a sphere, spin it enough for a little gravity, and then have tons of rotating habitats connected to the skin which each spun, so it looked like a big spiky ball. 

We will talk another time about how to make super-large spinning habitats like Ringworlds using active support. 

But that’s purpose #1, replicating Earth. 

You could devote a planet’s worth of space just to single biomes serving as nature preserves, have a million Earths worth of such nature preserves, and still use only a thousandth of your available space. 

You also can focus more on human living area, by using the sunlight for more optimized plant growth via hydroponics and have folks live in more urban or suburban garden setups, akin to those discussed in the Arcologies and Ecumenopolis episodes. 

This dual mix is probably more likely, nature preserve, suburban sprawls, and urban areas with some parks and lots of hydroponics. 

You can also genetically engineer life from the ground up to live in a vacuum environment and just let it set up its own Dyson swarm. 

Although genetic engineering might be a stretch, since you might have to start from the ground up, not even using DNA or carbon as your basis. 

I’m not sure how practical that is, but I’ve always found the notion rather fascinating and may discuss it more if I ever do an episode on space-based life, or life designed specifically to live in space. 

Emphasis on design because it’s very unlikely to ever evolve on its own. 

Of course you can also use a lot of that energy to run totally artificial life and giant computers, and one focused entirely on that is called a Matrioshka Brain, see that episode. 

You can also go the big laser option, the Nicoll-Dyson Beam, or the big transmutation version, where you are trying to extract all the mass you can from a star and turn it into heavier elements. 

This has no official name so I just call it a Star Mine or Dyson Mine, and its cousin, the one that just stores power into miniature black holes, a ‘kugelblitzer’ or Kugelblitz Dyson. 

You can also tune one in its entirety to act as a giant transmitter, a Stellar Beacon, converting all that energy into ultra-powerful signals you could pick up galaxies away. 

You might use a few stars for doing this, as a sort of Galactic Positioning System, if you had an interstellar civilization, since a galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, so you have a few to spare. 

Lastly, you can use them to move stars, a version known as a Shkadov Thruster. 

That has its own episode too, but in short form you build a half-dyson, typically of statites, the Dyson Bubble, and cause the sunlight to emit all in one direction, providing thrust in the opposite direction. 

The Star provides the thrust and holds onto the satellites, including natural ones like planets, with its own gravity. 

This along with Star Lifting, are good ways to prevent big stars blowing up near your civilization, either by mining them down in mass or moving them to a safe distance. 

By default a Dyson Sphere would be all of these at once, but there are advantages to specializing in one specific ability. 

Any Dyson Sphere can move itself by reflecting its light asymmetrically or star lifting matter off the sun to spray in one direction as a big rocket engine. 

Any of them can power rotating habitats for people or nature preserves, any of them can generate huge beams that can move spaceships around locally or to interstellar distances, or upscale them further to blow planets apart light years away. 

Any can run vast networks of computers or transmutation farms or power storage depots or interstellar highways. 

I would tend to assume you would do all of these simultaneously. 

An early Dyson is a thin one being used mostly for power and heavy matter creation and extraction, as time goes on it replaces power collection with habitats, unless you go all digital in which case those habitats are enormous processors and databanks. 

The Matrioshka Brain, which also has its own episode, is the classic example of this computer-focused Dyson taken to the extreme. 

Or at least the extreme using classic computing and just one star, we’ll discuss something using reversible computing next week. 

All of these concepts work around using a star as the central fuel source for some sort of engine or system, which is why these are also often called Stellar Engines. 

But even if you have better methods of power generation than a star, you still extract that matter and energy to fuel those better methods instead, be it controlled fusion or raw matter to energy conversion. 

You also still make the swarm because you want to be fairly close to other people or entities to minimize travel time on matter and information, and that’s as close as you can be without getting too hot. 

That’s a big note, Dyson's do not absorb energy from a star, they temporarily absorb it, use it, and radiate it away as heat, or light in lower frequencies like infrared. 

If you didn’t you would fry everyone inside, and the only way to avoid that is to be able to break the laws of thermodynamics, which also renders a Dyson unnecessary anyway. 

A Dyson is just as bright as the original star, only it will appear physically larger and more diffuse, glowing in the infrared range instead of the visual range of light. 

They also cannot be mistaken for any natural object. 

They look identical to some gas giants in the outer reaches of a solar system, but ‘identical’ in the same way a grapefruit looks like a star; they are roughly the same shape and color. 

Nobody with the technology to see either would ever mistake the one for the other, nor be fooled even momentarily by any method I have ever heard suggested for concealing a Dyson that did not require technologies not permitted under known science. 

This is not a Fermi Paradox episode, but Dyson's were inextricably linked to the Fermi Paradox right from the get go; so they tend to always make people wonder about it. 

I’m sure folks will ask about it in the comments, and by all means go ahead, you should be trying to think up loopholes, but please make sure to check the other comments first. 

Odds are I will have already answered the question and it gets a bit repetitive explaining how they could never be made to look like cosmic background radiation and are not a candidate for dark matter. 

Ditto how civilizations might stop growing, and not need one, or miniaturize and not need one, we covered all that in the Dyson Dilemma episode and its remake in more detail anyway. 

I always advise people to resort to common sense instead though. 

You generally only go out of you way to hide out of fear, and so you only hide a Dyson from something that is bigger or stronger than one, and since any Dyson civilization, a Kardashev 2 civilization, is quite capable of monitoring every single star in a galaxy, those contemplating building one know that anyone who already had one or better already knows where they live. 

On top of that, building a Dyson sphere isn’t exactly covert. 

It is kind of like trying to build a deep hidden bunker next to a town while using heavy machinery and explosives for excavation. 

Bigger, older civilizations will know you are there, and they will see you building it. 

So you can build one of these. 

More technology helps but as soon as you can begin profitably doing any mining or construction in space, you have the technology to make one. 

They’re not high-tech anymore than a city is, but like a city, more technology is better, and you can do a lot of R&amp;D when a mere millionth of your population is 10 trillion people, and a millionth is about what we use for any minor sub-discipline of the sciences, like how many folks specifically study dolphins full time. 

You can see the Kardashev Scale episode for more exploration of the sheer scale of a civilization that large, and what it can do even without super-technologies. 

They could basically beat the snot out of any classic galactic empire of millions of planets, since they have a billion planet’s worth of space back home. 

Just one of those Ladder States, even an O’neill Cylinder variety, keeps around the kind of resources and population that matches most fictional interstellar empires. 

But I personally doubt they’d tend to be monolithic, more likely hundreds of various coalitions ranging from fairly centralized ones to loose coalitions with self-defense and trade treaties. 

Possibly even totally independent entities that cooperate with their neighbors no more than agreeing not to shoot them, or block their light, or ram into them. 

Your guess is as good as mine. 

Fundamentally though, this is what we expect all technological civilizations to tend to converge towards, barring any radical changes in our understanding of physics. 

You’d probably have tons of smaller conglomerations of structures far out in deep space too, and interstellar travel is an automatic ability of a Dyson civilization so they’d probably have colonies nearby and be sending more out all the time. 

We’d also expect each colony to eventually do the same; again, no real need for cooperation, even a single O’Neill cylinder could probably manufacture a colony ark ship with just the kind of technologies available to them that we consider on the radar for the next century or so. 

We have reexamined material I’ve discussed in other episodes pertaining to Dysons, but I’ve tried to keep away from those in detail, so those other episodes I’ve been mentioning will answer a lot of questions you might have on these things if you haven’t seen them yet, but I think we can stop here for today. 

Hopefully by now you have a clearer image on what these things are and why so many of us tend to just take their future existence almost for granted. 

There’s so many reasons to build one, the capability appears to be there, and I’ve never heard a good reason not to build one. 

Even if your population plateaus off way short of what you’d need to fill one of these up, you still have reason to build one. 

Just collect and store matter and energy to preserve your civilization far longer than the default maximum of about 4 billion years before the Sun starts dying. 

I can imagine a civilization that decides to be zero-growth even when it doesn’t need to be, but I’d still expect them to try to extend their possible existence out longer. 

Next week we will be looking at that concept, in the long-awaited sequel to Civilizations at the End of Time, where we will look beyond the Black Hole based civilizations we looked at there and explore continuing on past the Dark Black Hole Era with options such as reversible computing, Boltzmann brains, and Iron Stars.

Orbital Rings

Orbital Rings represent ones of the best ways to get people off a planet, they also happen to be handy if you want to build a planet too. 

So today’s topic, Orbital Rings, is the culmination of this series, especially the concepts we have discussed in the last two episodes, Launch Loops and Space Towers. 

You don’t have to have seen those first, but I spent more time explaining the basic concept of Active Support in those. 

The Orbital Ring has so many applications I didn’t want to spend much time repeating the basic physical concepts in favor of exploring those. 

I’ve talked in passing about the Orbital Ring before, indeed we covered it briefly in one of the oldest episodes on the channel, and I regret being brief there because we bypassed so many of the uses these things have. 

This series has been mainly focused on getting into space cheaper and safer, and we have discussed some systems that are so much cheaper that they can be used to get more people up into space at prices that make it affordable for an average person to take a vacation up in space. 

The Orbital Ring goes far beyond permitting more scientific research or expensive vacations though, it is a system that genuinely allows people to commute to space for work in the morning and still come home for dinner, and spend no more for a ticket to orbit than you would for a train or plane ticket to a neighboring city. 

We’ve discussed the concept of active support and dynamic structures before, and in a good deal of detail in the last couple episodes of this series, so I will keep the review this time brief. 

Normally materials provide passive support, the forces which bind molecules together or keep them apart keep a material from ripping apart under tension or smashing together under compression. 

Some materials are stronger than others. 

It’s very easy to rip apart tissue paper, and far harder to tear apart Kevlar. 

But even super-materials like carbon nanotubes and graphene have their limits, and we have yet to mass produce them. 

We have an alternative way to hold stuff up though, we can push on it. 

That’s what keeps a sheet of paper hovering over an air vent or a helicopter hovering in the air. 

In the last episode we looked at keeping things in place by bouncing materials upward inside them, allowing super tall structures, but the Orbital Ring uses a different method more akin to that which we saw in the Lofstrom Loop, but still a bit different. 

When I place something into a stable circular orbit, it has a speed based on the mass of the object it is orbiting and the distance it is orbiting at. 

That’s around 8 kilometers, or 5 miles per second for the area of space just above our atmosphere. 

It actually drops as you get further away, just 3 kilometers a second when you get out to geostationary distances, slow enough that you orbit at the same speed the Earth turns on its axis, so that you stay above the same point. 

Further out, at the Moon, the speed is about 1 kilometer per second, and drops the further you go until you are no longer bound to Earth gravitationally. 

We haven’t been much interested in this series with space beyond Low Orbit, let alone beyond Geostationary, but we are today, so keep that in mind. 

It’s the speed that matters, not the angle, you can orbit Earth around the equator or from pole to pole at the same speed. 

But each orbital path is a unique thing and any object on that same path, with that same speed, won’t seem to move relative to anything else on that path. 

Which means if I’m in orbit of earth in a space suit, and let go of a flashlight I was holding onto, it will seem to just sit there next to me, unless I gave it a little shove in which case it would drift away. 

So I could put several objects in that same orbital path and they’d sit there together unmoving, relative to each other, they’d still be zipping around the Earth at high speed, but then so are you and everything in your home, zipping around the planet, and on the planet around the Sun and around the Galactic Core too. 

Everything is moving but it is a relative motion. 

If I were standing on one of those objects I could lay a bridge down to the next and walk over just fine, though since we are in freefall, I’d basically float not walk. 

I could extend this all the way around the orbital path as a big ring. 

This orbiting ring would travel around just fine, but isn’t much use to us as is. 

On that same note, if I had a perfectly rigid material, I could construct a ring out of it around the Earth and it would just hang there, even without orbiting, because all the gravity on it would cancel out. 

This would be quite useful since it would be stationary to the ground, if unstable. 

Also we have no perfectly rigid material so it would sag down to the planet. 

The one orbiting would not, since it experiences no gravity, or rather its inertia or centrifugal force cancels that gravity out. 

It’s also technically unstable, but we can fix that and in a way that makes it more useful too, we’ll get to that shortly. 

So far so good though, I could make a nice metal hoop around the planet, and if it were spinning at orbital velocity it would stay in place. 

Now imagine for the moment we stuck a bunch of magnets on this metal hoop, actually, since it is a big piece of metal we probably wouldn’t need to put any magnets in it, just run an electric current through it, but let’s keep it conceptually simple for now. 

The ring has a bunch of magnets on it. 

Now I build a big space tower next to it like the ones we discussed last episode, and I reach out and put a magnet over some spot on the spinning hoop. 

The hoop is spinning around very fast, whereas I am stationary to the Earth, so if I touched it that hoop would slice through me like a circular saw. 

But it won’t be touching that magnet, the magnets on the hoop will push back against it. 

That’s not terribly stable, but if I took a bracelet with magnets on it and opened it up and clapped it around the orbiting ring, it would just hover there. 

If I put some more on they’d hover there too, and I could put some platform there and stand on it. 

This would be different than before though, because before all those objects were in orbit too, these are just hanging right over the Earth, the ring is orbiting but they aren’t. 

So when I stand on my platform I feel gravity, almost as much as on Earth. 

I could take this bracelet and extend it around the ring to make a second ring around my orbiting ring and it would not be moving relative to Earth, I could walk around the entire thing just like I was on the Earth only high up, no air and gravity is a bit weaker. 

I could even build an airtight house up there. 

As I added weight though, I’d notice the orbiting ring was beginning to sag a bit. 

See, that ring has just enough momentum to stay in place, in orbit, on its own. 

Now I’m adding mass that isn’t moving, has no momentum, and the system, the orbiting part plus the stationary part, needs to have enough momentum to stay in orbit. 

I could go ahead and get my stationary parts up to orbital speed, fixing the problem, but that kind of defeats the purpose. 

Instead I can add more momentum to the ring, speed it up a bit beyond normal orbital velocity. 

Now the whole system has just the right momentum to stay in orbit, even though the orbiting ring has a bit too much and the stationary part not enough. 

This is the basic concept, I take a hoop of metal, a millimeter thick or kilometer thick, and spin it around the planet at orbital speed. 

If I run some current through it to make it a magnet, or am using a ferromagnetic material like iron or nickel, I can now float things over it, by spinning the ring a little faster. 

The circumference of Earth is just over 40 million meters, so if I made such a hoop out of standard thin wire, say 25 grams a meter, that hoop would weigh a million kilograms. 

Way too much for a single rocket to lift up, but you can bring it up in segments and solder it together, it’s just wire. 

Indeed we can fly up next to it and add more wire, more strands, since if we’re in orbit it just seems to be hanging there, so we can add to it as we want. 

We can also spin it faster to let us add more weight suspended above or around it. 

Now a spinning ring that we start spinning faster than orbital speed is going to have more centrifugal force added to it, and if we get enough of that it will rip the ring apart. 

But for the moment, we can have a spinning ring inside a stationary pipe that’s magnetically kept afloat from touching it. 

That ring is over 40,000 kilometers long, the rough circumference of the Earth, (a space elevator is about the same length) and unlike a space elevator this is just wire—plain, regular old wire. 

Nothing special about it. 

Nothing special about the conduit around it either, except that it's got magnets on it and we can make those electromagnets so that we can run power through them and use that to speed the ring inside up or slow it down if we need to add or subtract weight from the whole thing. 

We can hang some solar panels off to the side, attached to the conduit, to provide the power for that. 

We now have a solid ring in space, not seeming to move relative to the ground below, with a power source that can let us add weight to it. 

Now the outside isn’t moving relative to the surface of the earth, so we could have this at pretty much any altitude we wanted, one of these would work just over the ground, but we will say it’s about 80 kilometers up, same as the Lofstrom Loop. 

We could drop a rope down from there and someone could climb up from the ground. 

Now a regular rope couldn’t handle that and no one could climb that, but we have plenty of fairly mundane substances that do have a breaking limit of more than 80 kilometers. 

We’re not sure if stuff like graphene can handle going up tens of thousands of kilometers, but we’ve got plenty that can handles tens or hundreds of kilometers. 

This includes those that can handle having current run through them, or are strong enough to let us bolt some wire to them at least. 

So we drop a cable down to Earth with a wire in it, and some elevator with an electric motor grabs that cable and its power cord and uses that to pull itself up to the ring. 

Power can be supplied by some other solar panels up on the ring, or down on the planet. 

Even without superconductors, we can run an electric cable 80 kilometers without losing too much power. 

Which conveniently means we can run power from all those solar panels on the ring, where there are no cloudy days, down to Earth too. 

But never mind that for now. 

This is the basic Orbital Ring. 

It can be scaled up, you can make thicker rings or add more rings right next to it though in practice you’d want to have every other one spinning backwards, in retrograde orbit. 

They wobble too, so rather than running cables straight down, you’d often want to angle them, like guy wires, but that’s better than okay, because they don’t all have to run out at the same angles so you could have wires stretching a few hundred kilometers off to connect straight to cities, and those can be quite solid wires you could run cable cars up, or scaled up enough, entire trains. 

They can just move at normal speeds too, like any train or tram, not causing sonic booms or threatening to blow up cities if they fall off. 

You could build wide platforms up there with domes and people could walk around them just like on Earth, since there is gravity. 

You could hang structures from them too, like the Analemma Tower, now suspended from a cable only 80 kilometers long, not tens of thousands. 

Indeed, so long as you keep a vacuum in that conduit, you could hang the ring just over mountain height. 

You could put massive solar farms, or regular farms, up there and bring that power or food down to Earth. 

You can bring all the mass you want up from Earth for no more cost than the production and maintenance costs of the cable car and solar panels powering it. 

Nor does that inner spinning element need to necessarily be a wire under lots of strain if you spin it up too fast, you could use big particle accelerators. 

But this brings up another important point, what you do once up there? 

Truth be told, you don’t need any other applications. 

An Orbital Ring of this type lets you zip around the planet and up to orbital heights and down to other spots quite cheaply, but you are just at orbital height, not orbital speeds. 

Step off the ring and you will fall down. 

Though you will just fall down, not ‘re-enter’, so if you have a pressure suit, oxygen mask, and a parachute, you could survive. 

I imagine ring-diving would be a popular sport. 

Why are these good for space though? 

Recall that when we discussed mass drivers I said the track needed to be mostly straight because at orbital speeds your turning radius is huge, unless you want to be pancaked by centrifugal force when you turn. 

Mass Drivers and Lofstrom Loops had to be thousands of kilometers long just to allow 3 gee acceleration to normal orbital speed, they need to be much longer if you only want to do one-gee, normal Earth gravity. 

But an orbital ring offers us a couple of unique advantages. 

First off, it goes around the entire planet, so that is your turning radius if you are trying to build up speed to launch away from Earth. 

Totally non-coincidentally, the turning radius for an object at that altitude for 1 gee of acceleration is exactly orbital speed, that’s why you are in free fall when orbiting. 

Now centrifugal turning force acts outward, while gravity pulls inward, so a ring around the planet has those two forces in opposite directions. 

That means if we strap a vehicle to the ring and start speeding it up, running around in circles, the force of gravity is cancelling out that centrifugal force. 

Indeed, if we were pulling two gees of acceleration, we could stand on the ceiling of our vehicle, or just flip it over, and feel like normal gravity, only upside down. 

We could build up to over 11 kilometers a second like that, the escape velocity of Earth. 

8 kilometers a second will get you into orbit, but it takes 11 to escape out past the moon. 

Those ground based systems like mass drivers and launch loops usually aim for 3 gees as pretty safe for most people, with gravity canceling out 1 of that we could do 4 on the ring, and be doing 16 kilometers a second when we release the ring, at whatever point we want, it is a circular track after all so we can do loops, and fly off at 16 km/s, a decent speed for interplanetary travel even if you don’t have rockets to help, which you would since you can bring all the fuel you want up to that ring. 

Most of the solar system is reasonably close to inline with our own equator, so you are fairly close to the right direction north or south when you let go of an orbital ring around the equator, but these rings don’t have to be around the equator, they can be at whatever angle. 

You can have another one at a different angle just above or below your own and take an elevator to it, or to another one even further up. 

So you can take off from Earth even faster if you don’t mind doing more gees, and freight could handle a lot more than passengers, and you can also take off from a ring further up. 

As you get further from Earth, you lose a bit of that gravity advantage canceling things out, but you gain more turning radius and you are further up in the gravity well and won’t lose as much speed leaving it. 

You can build as many rings as you please at any angle or height you want, and so long as the space between two rings isn’t so high that a cable between them would need to be super-strong, you just take the elevator to the next ring up. 

Out at geostationary, 42,000 kilometers from the center of Earth, there’s not much gravity left, but 1 gee of acceleration will get you 20 kilometers per second of speed, and 4 gees would get you 40 kilometers a second, that’s the escape velocity from the solar system, and that is 3.5 million kilometers a day, not a bad interplanetary speed even if you are only using fuel to slow down. 

This doesn’t include the Earth’s own orbital speed around the Sun either, of about 30 kilometers a second, which is quite a nice boost since everything further from the Sun is moving slower. 

You don’t have to stop there either, you could build these rings all the way out to the moon and beyond, and you could fly off from those at 60 or 120 kilometers a second, for 1 and 4 gee respectively, having never burned a drop of fuel, sailing out at 14 million kilometers a day, a speed that will get you to Mars at its average distance from us in 10 days. 

You can slow down with these too, in the same way. 

You’re not touching the ring when speeding up, you are using electromagnetic propulsion to avoid friction, and you don’t need to touch it to slow down either. 

Indeed, you could just have something running around on the ring at that speed shoot a tether out to harpoon an incoming ship and slow it and you down the same way you sped up, so long as the tether is decently strong. 

The exterior shell of a ring doesn’t have to be stationary either. 

You could forego the sheath or even have the sheath spin and the inner wire staying stationary. 

A ring like that right next to a stationary ring might have some advantages for moving ships, too; you match speeds with your train and jump on over. 

Those cables in the atmosphere connecting the ring, or the bottom ring, to the Earth, would tend to be pretty numerous since any town who could afford one within a couple hundred kilometers of a ring would probably want one, you really do not have to worry about wind or lightning in these things but you can just detach them or reel them in during bad storms, the rings only need a little a force to keep them from wobbling so even a few cables is enough and you’d have hundreds if not thousands connecting to each ring, so reeling some in during storms is no big deal. 

I imagine by now you can start seeing why I always refer to Orbital Rings like a whole different level of space launch technology, and we aren’t done with the cool advantages yet. 

But so far, we’ve mostly been talking about small ones, or just their use alone, or with other rings. 

Before we scale up and talk hybrids, let’s talk safety and cost. 

As to safety, for the smaller ones, that inner ring is spinning faster than orbital speeds so if it gets damaged and flies out, probably shredding part of the ring in the process, it will fly out not down, and those bits which don’t will burn up in reentry. 

The stationary part will just fall, but as with previous systems we can attach explosive charges to break it into smaller bits and let parachutes slow those down. 

That option is totally out the window for the bigger ones we will get to in a moment, but those are much sturdier since they’d have tons of rings that supported them, not just one. 

As an example of hybrid tech though, while we can place another ring right below and at an angle to a ring, so that it might fall to rest on its neighbor, we can also use the Atlas Pillars from last episode to run straight up beneath the Ring like normal support pylons. 

Though they need not run up straight either. 

Of course you could bypass the internal spinning ring or particles with these, just one big suspension bridge running around the planet or just part way, or even at angles, but the ring is better and the Atlas Pillars just allow a nice addition of capacity and safety. 

As to cost, that’s another story. 

Once the first ring is in place you can use it to bring all the rest up quite cheaply, but that first ring probably needs to be fairly sturdy and mass at least several thousand tons, so it essentially the same price range as bringing up a basic space elevator, same concept too, you get a simple small one up and use it to bring more mass up. 

More expensive than a space elevator though, since those assume super-strong and super-light materials, the orbital ring is just copper or iron. 

Cheap but expensive to get into space. 

This is one of the reasons mining and industrializing the Moon, with its huge quantities of raw materials and negligible gravity and atmosphere, is very attractive to us. 

It is just as useful, indeed arguably more so, even with an Orbital Ring making freight costs up from Earth cheaper, but it makes it far easier to build that first Orbital Ring, especially if you want it to be a decently large and handy one. 

I would be a lot more confident bootstrapping more rings from a first Orbital Ring a meter or more thick massing a couple tons per meter of length than a hair thin wire, and at a circumference of 40 million meters, such a ring would mass in around a hundred megatons. 

More mass than everything we’ve lifted to orbit combined, but better to start that way and so better to use the earlier and more modern systems we’ve discussed to get Moon and Asteroids first. 

When colonizing the West Coast, you start with the Oregon Trail, not a massive 3 lane Interstate Freeway, after all. 

So this is definitely not your next step in making space cheap, nothing offers cheaper costs per kilogram launched, but it takes a lot to set up and its real advantage is throughput, not cost per item launched. 

Only the Space Elevator even gets in the ballpark with the Orbital Ring on that score, and that does require materials we don’t really have. 

The orbital ring on the other hand, while quite a feat of engineering in every respect, relies only on modern tech, though a power source like fusion and access to room temperature superconductors make it a lot better. 

You don’t just build one either, you build a bunch at different angles around the planet, with cables running off to any place that wants one. 

The orbital ring network makes a nice launch point for interplanetary travel, but it’s even more phenomenal for intra-planetary travel, you take a cable from your town to orbit, at whatever speed local law permits, arriving in less than an hour even if it's a wide angle, long cable and limited to subsonic speeds, and from there race around to your exit ramp at hypersonic velocities. 

If those rings are big enough and those cables sturdy enough, it's not just passengers traveling anywhere on the globe in a couple hours, its bulk freight by the megaton doing it too. 

Scaled up, one of these ring networks can handle billions of people and billions of tons of cargo moving to and from space every day. 

And you can really scale these up too. 

That guy wire going to the ring could instead be a big highway with a dome tunnel over it you could drive your car up. 

Those rings don’t have to be meters wide but could be kilometers, and if they are low enough in the atmosphere to gain some protection from meteors and space trash, which you are at 80 kilometers up, you could just dome over places and walk around with regular old air, sunlight, and gravity. 

You wouldn’t have to stop your car drive when you arrived either, or your walk. 

People ask sometimes about being able to connect a space elevator straight from the moon to Earth, and you can’t even with a super strong material because the moon is tidally locked to Earth but not the other way around. 

You can do that with Pluto and Charon for instance, since they are both locked to each other and always show the same face. 

With an Orbital Ring you actually can do this. 

Orbital Rings don’t have to be perfect circles for one thing, but that’s not what I mean. 

You’ve got a stationary ring around the Earth, just above the atmosphere or way out at geostationary or even further. 

One you’re up at geo though, the strength of gravity is so low you don’t need strong materials for thousand kilometer long tethers anymore, so you could easily build one up from that ring out to the moon’s orbit. 

We could put a ring there, too; but more importantly we could have an elevator come off the Moon and stretching all the way to that ring at geostationary. 

That ring’s sheath doesn’t need to be moving at normal geostationary speed, nor does the tether to the moon have to stay fixed. 

You don’t even need fancy magnetic connections either. 

The moon only goes 1 kilometer a second, we can actually make traditional mechanical connections that can handle such things. 

So yes, with an orbital ring network, a big one but not a high tech one, you could grab a train from your hometown wherever on Earth and step out of it on the Moon somewhere. 

I imagine you’d just take a ship from the first ring instead, or one of the higher ones closer to geostationary, those already offer launch speeds fast enough to let you make that trip in under a day, the 4 gee shot off the geostationary one would get you there in three hours, but you could actually ‘walk’ from Earth to the Moon with this kind of network, though you’d need magnetic boots once you got far from Earth’s gravity well. 

Though you could also make the connection between rings be hollow spinning tubes with spin-gravity too. 

You can also scale this up to go between planets, a bit silly but possible. 

I remember some years back before I started the channel and used to play with more extreme forms of megastructures… not the ones we’ve covered on the channel, those are all basic ones, even the solar system sized ones… I tried coming up with a way to walk, swim, sail, or fly between planets and orbital rings and dynamic structures do actually let you do crazy stuff like that. 

More down to Earth, literally, they do let you wake up in the morning at home and commute to space for work. 

And you can make a lot of living space in low orbit too. 

There’s a game setting called Warhammer 40k, or 40,000, set in the year 40,000. 

Many of you are probably already familiar with it and it features Earth, called Terra in that, as a galactic capital home to trillions, an example of an Ecumenopolis, which we’ve discussed before. 

In that there’s something mentioned called an ‘orbital plate’, which is described as a small continent floating over the planet, and they’ve got several. 

No real details are given about them or how they hang out there, they do have anti-gravity in that series though so probably that, but orbital rings let you do stuff like that. 

Indeed, you could stick a bunch of them, all wide and at different angles and slightly different height, up over a planet to totally enclose it, lay down some mesh and some dirt and water and air and you’ve got a new planetary surface. 

You can do something like that around a gas giant like Saturn and produce what is called a Supramundane Planet, or Shellworld, you could do several concentric shells around Earth and produce what we call a Matrioshka Shellworld, both of which are discussed in the episode Shellworlds from a couple years back. 

I was going to say that with Orbital Rings the Sky’s the Limit as to what you can do, but that’s not really a good saying considering the Sky is specifically not the limit with them. 

If you’ve got enough power and can use it without too much waste heat being produced, basically if you’ve got good superconductors and fusion, you can build some truly monstrous stuff. 

Particularly since the Atlas Pillar variation we discussed last time let’s you make straight lines not just curves, and orbital rings don’t have to be circles, and you can change these things dimensions, that’s part of why we call them dynamic structures. 

I think by now you can see why I saved Orbital Rings for last, and why I’ve spent the whole series talking about how much more awesome they are than the other concepts for getting stuff into space cheaper and safer. 

Now I’m not formally closing out the Upward Bound Series, we may revisit it more in the future, we’ve got tons of concepts we haven’t covered yet and others we could cover in more detail that just shared an episode with a few other related concepts. 

However, this ends the series for now and the main sequence of it. 

We have looked at space elevators and skyhooks and mass drivers, we’ve talked about ways to improve rockets by making them reusable or giving them better power sources like atomic ones or metallic hydrogen. 

We’ve looked at thousand kilometer long floating launching loops and runways suspended from towers so tall they don’t just scrape the sky but rise over it. 

Now, finally, we see the orbital ring. 

I don’t know what technologies we will see in between modern rocketry and this concept, but barring a big game changer like anti-gravity or wormholes we can open from planet to planet like in Stargate, I think this one is the final product of the effort to get people off the ground and up to the heavens. 

Even things like cheap compact fusion we could make space planes with doesn’t really rival this in terms of volume, because those will produce so much thrust and heat that you could never use millions of them a day on the planet. 

This system doesn’t just get you into space cheap, it gets your whole civilization up there cheap and lets you truly engage in bulk trade and transport, and that’s always been the real goal, not to get a few astronauts to Mars, but to make it so cheap and easy that going to the Moon is like flying to another country and going to another planet takes as much time and money as an ocean cruise. 

  So that’s the series wrap up on Upward Bound, Getting into Space. 

If those giant megastructures like the Shellworlds caught your interest, I’d suggest trying the Megastructures playlist, though you can skip the first three episodes since those are just quick overviews of what we covered in more detail in this series. 

Those are older episodes, so the graphics and audio quality are a lot lower, but the meat and potatoes are still there. 

If you’re interested in some of the civilization aspects of folks who could build orbital rings, try the Advanced Civilizations series, starting with Arcologies. 

If you want continue on past leaving this planet, try the Life in a Space Colony series.

Fermi Paradox Great Filters: Space and Time
---
  
2017-06-22  
https://youtu.be/ZlgyxQJHHcY  

---

Our galaxy consists of hundreds of billions of stars and trillions of planets. 

There’s something deeply disturbing about the idea that we might be the only ones living in it. 

So today we return to the Fermi Paradox series for the first in a short series of episodes discussing all the possible factors which might contribute to making technological civilizations like our own extraordinarily uncommon. 

We have looked at, and will discuss more in the future, some possible ways in which we might be surrounded by advanced civilizations and just not be aware of it. 

We can never safely discount the possibility that they might drop by for a visit, if indeed they have not already done so. 

However, the Occam’s Razor approach to the Fermi Paradox, the seeming contradiction between the immensity of the Universe, and the apparent absence of any other advanced civilization than our own, is that there just aren’t any close enough for us to detect. 

That’s really not a big problem in and of itself. 

After all, we can’t even see most of the equipment we left on our own Moon half a century ago, let alone buildings on other planets around other stars, and we certainly haven’t built anything on other planets yet. 

No man has ever traveled further than our own Moon, and except for those twelve and some hundreds who have traveled a couple hundred kilometers over the planet to low orbit, nobody has yet left our own homeworld. 

We don’t broadcast our signals very loudly and indeed they have gotten quieter as we’ve gotten more advanced, since efficiency encourages us to make them ever quieter and harder to recognize as a signal. 

We’d have problems hearing our own transmission with our own detectors much further away than our immediate neighboring star systems. 

Taken at face value then, it’s not much of a Paradox. 

So long as technological civilizations aren’t so common that virtually every star hosts one, there could be a billion of them in our galaxy alone. 

But this is not the actual Fermi Paradox and never has been, people get lost in that a bit. 

The paradox arises from conversations and speculation beginning around the mid-20th century, as we started getting an idea of how truly old and huge the Universe is, and also with the growing recognition that there was actually the possibility of reaching other planets and living on them. 

It is the awareness of this possible expansion that creates the Paradox. 

If you believe we won’t colonize our own solar system, let alone other ones, then there’s no real paradox. 

The Fermi Paradox is more properly known as the Fermi-Hart Paradox because it was Michael Hart’s conjecture back in 1975 that fully manifested the real paradox. 

We had landed on the Moon and were discussing the creation of bases and colonies on other planets. 

The first tentative interstellar ships were on the drawing table. 

Looking at that, he pointed out that we should expect our civilization to generally seek to expand and make use of places with no life on them as new homes for humans and their furry, feathered, scaly and other cousins. 

We do seem to want to do this and it does appear possible under known science which is steadily improving. 

The basic nature of biology seems to imply that other non terrestrial civilizations should tend to feel the same way. 

Any critters who have successfully clawed their way up Darwin’s Ladder ought to be strongly inclined to want to spread out and reproduce; this should hold for any natural alien biology as well. 

This is the paradox, and it gets far worse when you come to realize that colonizing other planets is advantageous and doable, but far less so than constructing vast swarms of artificial habitats to take advantage of all the sun’s light that is not hitting planets, which is very nearly all of it. 

Earth gets only a billionth of the light the Sun makes. 

Access to such power levels makes interstellar travel viable even without improved technology, as we’ve discussed elsewhere, and continuous improvements in computers and robotics make that travel, or the construction of such swarms, often called Dyson Swarms, far easier too. 

Now up until the day we actually have a colony in another solar system that builds its own colony ship to send folks further out, or have vast swarms of habitats whose combined living area grossly exceeds that of Earth’s, it is an entirely valid objection to say we can’t be sure if such expansion waves are possible from a practical standpoint. 

We’ve had the technology to land people on Mars since we went to the Moon, or to establish a base on the Moon, yet we’ve done neither, so capability doesn’t imply practicality. 

However, on this channel, I’ve spent dozens of episodes talking about getting off of Earth, constructing habitats, terraforming planets, and building interstellar starships. 

We’ve always vigorously confined ourselves to known science when doing this, barring a few looks at concepts like warp drives or wormholes. 

If you’re a channel regular, you probably feel pretty confident that interstellar travel is within reach, and that we can overcome those challenges to settle our own system and even our whole galaxy. 

So to restate our problem, if we can see a clear path to soon achieving interstellar travel as a species… a species that has evolved in a relatively short period of time on the cosmic time-scale, and if there is similar life out there in the galaxy, then our galaxy should be saturated with other evolved species who have already done so… so where the heck are they? 

Nor does the paradox end at the galaxy’s edge, and later this summer we’ll look at intergalactic colonization, and show that it is viable under known science as well, and we never know when some new Einstein might emerge to show us easier and faster means of space travel. 

The point is if we can do it, so could other civilizations, and even if some were disinclined, or blew themselves up before doing it, the galaxy ought to be settled a thousand times over by now if such civilizations are even slightly common. 

If just one planet per billion ever spawned civilizations with the capability and desire to settle the galaxy, and if just one of those did it even a few millions years before now, the galaxy should be as untamed and wild as New York or London. 

And you can’t miss such civilizations. 

You don’t need to see their homeworld, you don’t need to hear their radio, they’re just all over the place and there’s dozens of ways they’d be detectable, same as trying to detect intelligence in a major metropolis. 

Trying to hide all those blisteringly obvious signs of civilization would seem both impossible and pointless, you don’t hide civilizations you advertise them. 

Inside that framework of ideas folks have come up with tons of possible explanations for why such civilizations might not expand and build, or might hide, or might evolve in some way as to not wish to expand. 

Some seem a bit ludicrous on the surface, others are more sound but still seem fatally flawed. 

We went through a ton of both types back in the Fermi Paradox Compendium and we’ll give each one a more thorough going over in the future. 

But getting back to the topic for today, and this sub-series as well... since the reasoning on a lot of those solutions tends to break down, a lot of folks figure that civilizations just aren’t too common at all. 

Maybe planets that can host life, especially complex life, are far rarer than we think. 

The Rare Earth hypothesis. 

Maybe they’re decently common but the pathway to higher intelligence is a lot less likely than we think, with many hurdles filtering out evolutionary improvements along the road to sentience and sapience, or diverting them down different evolutionary paths. 

Maybe one of these filters is so strong, and so unlikely to be passed through, that virtually no one does. 

This has become known as the Great Filter Hypothesis. 

Now this intellectual camp on the Fermi Paradox is a big and diverse one, with many different suggestions for what causes technological civilizations to be rare, but that’s the shared view. 

The solution to the Fermi Paradox is that we don’t see alien civilizations because there are none, or they are so far away that we can’t see them yet... but not because they aren’t visible. 

You could see a galaxy sprawling Kardashev 3 civilization even billions of light years away, but the light from them wouldn’t have reached us yet. 

There may be no civilizations within a billion light years of us, but if one did arise 900 million light years away 800 million years ago, we couldn’t see it yet, even if it had turned entire stars into giant broadcast systems to say hello. 

There are many filters, some stronger than others, and it is hard to evaluate their relative strengths as we don’t know enough yet. 

However I generally classify them into 4 groups. 

Lesser Filters, those we’d be inclined to think would be passed through by most, given enough time. 

Minor Filters, those which most wouldn’t pass but we’d expect at least a &nbsp;small percentage to squeak through. 

Major Filters are ones which very few pass through but given the scale of the galaxy and the universe, you’d still expect a decent number of them overall. 

And lastly Great Filters, those which are lottery-odds at best, one in a million or less kinds of filters. 

This is the kind of filter that singlehandedly would shift civilizations from being so common you could hear each other's radio transmissions easily to so rare there might only be a handful galaxy, or less. 

Now most filters can be broken into many smaller ones. 

Earth might be quite rare but there’s a lot of ways it might be rare, none of which by themselves is terribly improbable, yet they might stack up to be such a Great Filter when assessed together. 

We showed an example of that in the aforementioned Compendium episode, arbitrarily assigning 50/50 coin flip odds to each of 50 proposed filters, and seeing how that stacked up to a probability so low that you’d have to search thousands of galaxies and quadrillions of stars to find another civilization. 

But those were not the only proposed filters by any means, and while many of them are demonstrably stronger than 50%, others might not be filters at all, but simply delaying factors. 

In this episode and the rest of this short series, we will be examining general categories of these filters in detail. 

Most discussions of this begin with the Rare Earth filters, but there are a few Great Filters that folks tend to bypass along the way, and we’ll be looking at some of those today. 

Some of you might be nodding your heads now and thinking of things like supernovae and gamma ray bursts, or the conditions and time spans necessary for heavy elements to collect, and indeed you are right to do so, but we can go back even further. 

For us to examine all the reasons why civilizations might be rare in this universe, we should not skip the rarity of our Universe itself, nor the importance of time when regarding it. 

So that will be our focus for today. 

Later in the series we’ll talk about the filters to get to intelligent life, of which we have many examples besides humans, and from there we will discuss all of the hurdles and filters you must navigate in going from high animal intelligence to launching rockets into space. 

These are all big topics which might need further sub-division as we go but for now those will be our primary great filters, and each will get its own episode. 

But today we are looking at 3 which are not given much attention, largely because the Fermi Paradox has been phrased rather poorly. 

A big problem in many examinations of the Fermi Paradox, and what creates holes in various arguments concerning it, is that it tends to focus on our galaxy alone. 

The Universe does not end there, and not only might we detect civilizations further away than in our galaxy, we might have an easier time in doing this if they colonize other galaxies. 

This does not even require faster than light travel, though most folks tend to think we will achieve that one day. 

Personally I do not, both because known science doesn’t permit it except under some dubious scenarios that are mathematically valid but probably not physically valid, and because it tends to only exacerbate the problems in the Fermi Paradox. 

If faster than light (FTL) travel is possible, then you need to account for alien critters from civilizations that emerged over a billion light years away but more recently than a billion years ago. 

Indeed what we often consider the Universe, better known as the Observable Universe, are those parts that light has had time to reach us from and which are not traveling away from us faster than light. 

If you have FTL, you have to consider running into civilizations that do too and which originated in areas beyond our ability to see. 

And while we can’t be sure, the common thought is that our Universe is much larger than the observable parts, possibly a little bigger, possibly vastly bigger or even infinite. 

Part of the reason I don’t expect us to ever discover a means of traveling faster than light is because of the Fermi Paradox. 

A billion light years already seems a huge volume to not find other civilizations in, but it’s only about a millionth of the Observable Universe and the entire Universe might be much bigger, and even potentially infinite. 

If the latter is the case, an infinite universe implies infinite civilizations, even if they are vastly far apart. 

You can review the various reasons for that in the Infinite Improbability Issues episode, which are equally valid for an infinite or super-large universe as well as alternate timelines. 

Surely if FTL were possible some of those would have swung by here. 

But I just mentioned timelines and alternate universes and that’s more of the problem. 

If time travel is possible for instance, and if you have FTL travel, you should have time travel, fundamentally they’re the same thing. 

We have to worry not just about civilizations that might have popped up recently but are too far away to see yet, but also ones that haven’t even existed yet. 

The joke about what year time travel gets invented is ‘all of them’, and the ‘aliens’ you meet might even be folks from Earth far in the future. 

We have this same problem with alternate dimensions and realities, if they exist and you can travel to them, then that is presumably a two way street, and folks should be showing up from them as well. 

There are very solid scientific reasons why traveling through time, traveling to other realities, or traveling faster than light should be impossible, but I consider the strongest evidence against them to be that we haven’t run into any folks with this technology. 

We can reason that some aliens might be very hesitant to show off such technology to a primitive species, for whatever reason, but it’s quite a stretch to assume every single member of every species that exists in the entire universe, or its entire future history, or in other Universes, all feels that way. 

Nor is that in conflict with the idea that no one seems to be doing sub-light speed interstellar travel either, since for the latter I only need to establish that no one is doing it in our relatively small chunk of time and space, not the sheer immensity of the entirety of all time and space or even in other possible realities. 

Yet this does give us our first Great Filter too, and it’s called the Fine Tuned Universe. 

You’ve probably heard of it before in discussion of the Anthropic Principle. 

We’ve discussed that principle before, and have done episodes on two of its more common examples, the Doomsday Argument and the Simulation Hypothesis. 

But I intentionally avoided the Fine Tuned Universe consideration because it wasn’t pertinent at the time and tends to make folks get off onto heated theological discussions and attack each other, which I try to discourage here. 

Let me explain it quickly and simply though. 

The fundamental structure of our world and our universe is based on various physical constants, the most obvious being gravity which is strangely weaker than the other three known forces. 

Were it as strong as they, you wouldn’t be able to put enough atoms in one place to make even single celled organisms without their undergoing gravitational collapse into tiny black holes. 

So presumably any universe where gravity was that strong could not host life, though we’ll beat on that notion later this summer when we visit the concept of a Boltzmann Brain. 

Gravity is just one such example, we have a number of physical factors and dimensionless physical constants, that if they differed significantly from what they do in this Universe, would seem to prevent life from being possible. 

Indeed even very tiny alterations to these could make life impossible and if something has a value of 1,234,576, and can have any value up to a billion, but only 1,234,566, 67, and 68 permit life, you’re really lucky to live in a place where it has that value. 

In fact the odds against it are… well… astronomical. 

That is what causes the big theological arguments and why it is called Fine Tuning. 

One camp argues that it is so insanely improbable that those constants can’t possibly be random and if they aren’t random then some Intelligent Designer must have set them up that way. 

The other camp says that it can be random, if we simply assume a ridiculously large number of other realities with different values in which life doesn’t exist… and thus has no need to worry about how improbable their existence is. 

Yet I’ve never personally considered either argument particularly compelling. 

I could propose nearly exact copies of Earth with minor variations in gravity or pressure or composition and how these variations would prevent complex life from emerging, and indeed we’ll be discussing how such minor variations might impact the development of complex life later in this series. 

Those variations will include versions of Earth having less mass, different compositions, etc. 

A person living a few hundred years back would have been entirely justified in wondering if near exact copies of Earth, just with weaker gravity or thinner air, might exist. 

We now know though that these are not independent variables. 

If you want stronger gravity you need a more massive planet, or one that is denser. 

The surface gravity of Earth is that specific, seemingly arbitrary value of 9.807 meters per second squared for a reason and can’t just be 9.806 or 8, let alone 9,807 meters per second. 

If you head up from sea level a bit, climb up a mountain, gravity drops in a clear and predictable fashion. 

The pressure of 101,325 Pascals could vary from less than a Pascal to billions of them, but there is a reason why it is what it is and it is directly linked to the surface gravity, change one and you change the other. 

As we’ll see later in the series, there is more to atmospheric pressure than just that, but then none of those factors are random in their effect either. 

So I don’t like the Fine Tuning arguments just taking for a given that all of these physical constants have values pulled out of a hat, be it random or by divine fiat. 

It may be so, but it is entirely possible these things are connected. 

A man standing on a bunch of hexagonal cobblestones might be justified in wondering if that’s a natural phenomena and find himself absorbed in investigating how it could be so, until someone comes by and asks him to please stop poking at the bricks in her garden path. 

But in neither scenario, natural or artificial, would he be correct in simply assuming that the pattern was completely random. 

It could be that such a pattern might emerge somewhere in a vast enough field of stones, but we know from places like the Giant’s Causeway that such things can be the result of complex geological processes making them much more likely. 

We also know that humans like to build paths, generally out of clean geometric shapes that fit together and are of dimensions appropriate to our own bodies, width, and footspan. 

Neither is actually random. 

Yet those values could be random, or from a set that’s still quite large and in which very few combinations permit life, so we see this as our first Great Filter. 

Projected numbers vary on this wildly, and again we have no idea how random those constants are, if at all, but in most contemplations of this concept the improbabilities of being in one that can support life are so huge that they can only be meaningfully expressed in exponential notation. 

So it’s a pretty monumental Great Filter. 

You have to live in a Universe where life is possible in order to contemplate how likely it is to encounter aliens to chat with. 

There may be innumerable ones where the parameters don’t permit it, or make it far less common than in ours, or even far more common. 

We’ll get to that more in the Boltzmann Brain episode but a Universe truly fine-tuned for life should be one in which every drop of matter is being utilized towards that purpose almost from the get go, and ours is clearly not. 

That said, it actually used to be. 

The Universe is about 14 billion years old, but back when it was only 14 million years old, it was much closer together and about the temperature of warm bathwater. 

This was a short period, only a few millions years, perhaps decently longer if we assume life popped up then and was able to evolve enough to survive in a few places where local phenomena like gravitational heating kept things warm until stars emerged. 

Indeed it might have adapted enough to the increasing cold to survive, much as we often consider comets as possible sources for life, under the Panspermia hypothesis, as an alternative to shoreline tidal pools or deep sea thermal vents. 

I don’t favor Panspermia myself, but we don’t know how life started on Earth yet, and comets remain a viable scenario. 

We don’t know what conditions are required for Earth-style carbon based life, let alone all the options. 

So we want to be very careful as we move forward in the series from our geocentric perspective on life not to rule out that it might emerge from a wide variety of environments and elemental compositions besides carbon and liquid water. 

We will also see however, that when it comes to truly complex life, this situation is reversed, and there do not appear to be many environments that would allow technological civilizations to arise and flourish. 

It is that sort of advanced, intelligent life that the Fermi Paradox is interested in, not more basic forms of life which are incapable of space-travel or communicating with us. 

Simple life might be incredibly rare too, or so common it has developed multiple times in our own solar system, but you need a lot of biodiversity to spawn intelligence, excluding the Boltzmann Brain scenario, and for that you need a lot of energy, time, and pretty ideal conditions. 

We’ll get more into those as this series progresses, but that’s our second Great Filter. 

Earth is the only plausible place in our solar system to host truly complex life sophisticated enough to build spaceships. 

We might find extinct or even extant microorganisms elsewhere in the solar system. 

It might emerge wherever an appropriate chemical soup exists that is churned around by some energy source, but there’s no place with big animals and plants around that we can see. 

Even in a place like Europa, where you might feasibly have hidden marine life beneath the ice, it wouldn’t seem terribly realistic to expect to find civilizations. 

But even if life is that common, Earth composes about a millionth of the solar system’s mass, most of which is in the Sun or in the Gas Giants, neither of which seem hospitable places for life. 

All the other big moons and rocky planets combined still only account for a tiny fraction of the available mass in our solar system and most have no plausible energy source abundant enough to allow civilizations to have arisen there. 

Additionally, only a thin skin around the Earth, just the first several meters out of several million meters of rock and magma on the way to the center, actually hosts life. 

There are several trillion tons of matter on this planet that is incorporated into living tissues but the planet is around a billion times that in total mass, and the solar system a million times more massive than that. 

So in our solar system only about a quadrillionth of the matter is alive. 

Only a small portion of the matter in this universe is going to have the right composition, right density, and right amount of energy flux, an essential triad, to have any chance at all of being alive and a far smaller percentage of that will be positioned to be intelligent. 

Only one quadrillionth of &nbsp;our solar system’s matter is alive and not even a thousandth of that is actually contained within humans. 

A billion billionth, just a quintillionth, of this solar system is made of humans, not a bad Great Filter considering that’s in the ballpark of how many stars are in the part of the Universe we can plausibly hope to see recently enough in time for civilization to have arisen and be detectable. 

That takes us to our third and final great filter for today, which is Time, though perhaps it's unfair to call it a Great Filter. 

As I mentioned a moment ago the Universe used to be the temperature of warm bathwater, and life might have evolved all over back then, but the big hindrance to doing so was the lack of heavy elements. 

In astronomy and cosmology we usually refer to all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as metals, and for the most part only hydrogen and helium were around right after the big bang. 

Some heavier elements in trace amounts were around even then, but large quantities of them didn’t begin appearing till stars formed and died. 

The biggest stars live the shortest time, and make the heaviest elements, so those started appearing on the scene quite early in the game, about a hundred million years in, and the biggest stars are often shorter-lived than that. 

Yet it takes a while to accumulate a lot of these, and as we’ll see next time there’s a lot of factors that would have made the early universe inhospitable too, even in those lucky few places that might have gotten enough metals for a decent planet to form. 

But this is where we see time as a Great Filter and also see an important Fermi Paradox concept that people miss a lot. 

This Universe is still quite young at 14 billion years old, check back in 14 trillion years and it will still be quite ripe with stars, though appear far less massive and far bigger. 

Just one over-sized galaxy composed of the handful of our nearest neighboring galaxies merged together, an island of stars surrounded by an ocean of night trillions of light years across. 

Universal expansion will steal away virtually every galaxy we can see now, even as time lets light from further and further away reach us. 

Check back in 14 quadrillion years and it will all be dark, lit only occasionally by the collision of dead stars with each other or leftover planets. 

We’ve discussed how life might continue on &nbsp;during that time and beyond, indeed even flourish, but it won’t be naturally occurring anymore. 

No new planets spawning new civilizations. 

For the next several trillion years there will be stars and planets forming continuously, and barring artificial intervention life should be popping up a lot more often for most of that time. 

Our biggest constant filter is time not because some filters are impassable, but rather because they each take time to pass and you only have so much of it. 

Anything which delays development could make civilizations not emerge until their star dies, but more importantly, the Universe is young, and most of the stars in it are much younger. 

Most of them will live far longer than our Sun, which is actually on the heavy and short-lived side of normal, so some planet around a sun that will live 20 billion years might not host civilizations yet, but it’s still got a lot of time to get that done. 

The Rare Earth and Great Filter camps generally do not think life is all that rare, but as we’ll see in the series, the focus is more that advanced life like ourselves is pretty rare so far. 

Given more time, given more metals in the universe, we expect to see many more places host life and more of that develop intelligence. 

Check back in ten billion years and the galaxy might be boiling over in life-bearing planets with intelligent critters roaming around them. 

If we checked back in ten million years, we’d actually tend to expect life everywhere too, but originating from Earth, with us colonizing outwards. 

This is our last point for today, and it is what I call the Time Elapse Argument or (TEA). 

It comes up a lot in contemplating whether or not some peculiar phenomena is natural or indicates artificiality. 

We expect that as the universe gets older we would see more artificial aspects. 

More civilization arising and expanding and manipulating matter and energy. 

It follows from that then that a younger Universe would show less signs of all of the above. 

And since when we look far away in space we are also looking far back in time, you would expect anything which is artificial in nature to be less common the further away you look. 

So anytime we see some phenomena that folks think might indicate intelligence, our quickest way to check is to see if distant parts of the Universe have less of them. 

Ring galaxies for instance were often looked at as signs of an emerging Kardashev 3 civilization. 

The problem is they don’t appear any less common as you look further into the past... 

at least not until you look so far back that galaxy formation itself was still pretty rudimentary. 

Quasars, on the other hand, were more common in the past, with most galaxies having settled down since then, and so are clearly not a sign of life. 

Now some folks will point to the Supervoids, those huge areas of space absent of virtually all galaxies, and say that could be artificial. 

This is flawed logic for a number of reasons. 

The voids are indeed bigger now than they used to be, but they’re no bigger than the rate of expansion of the Universe would suggest. 

More importantly, they were there &nbsp;from the beginning expanding along with everything else and seem to do that in every direction we look. 

We wouldn’t expect civilizations springing up all over the universe to be expanding in the same ways, at the same rates, or from the same starting points. 

Especially ones predating any realistic timeline for the development of Earth-like planets. 

A void expanding around an emerging civilization as it begins converting stars into engines should have a starting point of at least a few billion years after the galaxies began forming, not right from the very outset. 

It also ought to give off huge amounts of Infrared radiation and exhibit measurable gravity in excess of the apparent matter present in them, which the voids do not. 

They should actually be devoid of visible stars entirely, which the voids also are not. 

There’s tons of stars and galaxies in those voids, just way less than in other places. 

But that’s the Time Elapse Argument in a nutshell, and it’s one that is important to keep in mind while contemplating the Fermi Paradox, along with Exclusivity and statistics in general. 

You might have gotten a rocky planet forming around a yellow sun as early as a couple hundred million years into the universe, possibly even seeded with life by comets made up of frozen ice from the Bathwater Epoch, but these ought to be very uncommon and the Fermi Paradox is all a statistics game. 

On the same note, we can easily talk about civilizations that might be very different than ours in behavior. 

They may not be interested in expansion, or may be going out of their way to hide, However we are operating on the assumption that intelligent life that manifest technological civilizations will tend to favor that kind of behavior for the same reasons we do. 

Evolution should favor growth-inclined species, and a taste for exploration and challenges ought to come with the curiosity you’d expect to be a prerequisite for developing technology. 

There may be exceptions to this, but they ought not be too common, and in this context we only care if the reverse is true, that such behavior is exceedingly rare. 

If expansion across a galaxy is possible and practical, than the desire to do it has to manifest much less often than the number of civilizations capable of it in a galaxy. 

If there is less than one such civ per galaxy, no problem, but if you’re talking thousands or millions, it gets a bit ridiculous to assume they all can but none choose too, so you either have to assume they can’t, because they don’t exist, or they can’t because it isn’t practical, or you have to assume that they don’t want to for some reason. 

As mentioned, we have talked about some reasons not to before and will do so again in the future, and of course we talk about the practicality of interstellar colonization all the time here. 

But our focus for the rest of this series on Great Filters of the Fermi Paradox will center around why they might just be incredibly rare, and we’ll pick that up in the next episode of the series by focusing on the Rare Earth Hypothesis, but also discussing whether an Earth-like environment is really necessary for life and why places with life but unlike Earth might not be able to evolve more sophisticated life as well. 

Next week we will be looking at ways to get a permanent foothold off of Earth, and closing out the Upward Bound Series by looking at Orbital Rings, massive structures that don’t just give you a foothold in space but rather a nice comfortable highway to the stars.

Upward Bound: Space Towers
---
  
2017-06-15  
https://youtu.be/5QLOAQmZbZs  

---

When it comes to dreaming up giant buildings and projects, we often say “The Sky’s the limit”, as we’ll see today, the sky is most certainly not the limit. 

So today we will be looking at Space Towers, Space Fountains, and Buoyancy-assisted launches. 

These are always popular concepts, and today we will see they have some advantages, but a lot of their popularity comes from a misconception about space and orbits. 

We tend to use ‘up in orbit’ as synonymous with being in space, but they are not the same thing. 

Just flying straight up in the air a couple hundred kilometers is not being in orbit and won’t keep you up there. 

You could jump up and wave at everyone on the International Space Station but only for an instant before you fell back down, and you’d only see them as a blur as they sped by at about 8 kilometers per second. 

They are in orbit, and you, unfortunately, are not. 

So simply building a giant tower up into space doesn’t get you into orbit, and launching from up high, from on top of a mountain or an airplane, does help, but not a lot. 

That said, it has a lot of other advantages that shouldn’t be ignored. 

For instance, there is a reason why we build cellphone and radio towers very high, it gives them a far larger coverage area, and up above the clouds you can also use solar power a lot more reliably. 

Before we get into the notion of active support structures, I thought we’d spend some time on buoyant structures instead. 

People often wonder about using blimps to lift spaceships up. 

Now as we have discussed before, it does help to be higher up when launching, but it mostly doesn’t help much. 

The advantage of the Launch Loop we discussed last episode isn’t that it lets you take off at high altitudes, but rather that it lets you accelerate against something while at high altitudes and speeds. 

Towing a rocket up on an airplane or blimp then releasing it for launch does have some advantages, so does launching from the top of a mountain, but they’re not usually substantial enough to justify the hassle. 

Partially that’s because buoyancy is limited, not by the total mass and density of the lifting gas and the object it is lifting, but the environment around it. 

A helium balloon filled on the Moon will fall to the ground for the same reason a ship can float on the ocean but will fall and smash if you push it off the side of a building. 

It’s all about relative density, that’s why a steel ship which is mostly full of air can float on water, even though steel is much denser than water, and why even a solid block of steel can float on mercury, the substance, not the planet, since mercury is denser than steel. 

Now the higher up you go the thinner the atmosphere gets. 

But it never actually reaches zero. 

So imagine for the moment if instead of suspending a rocket from a balloon you instead suspend a section of platform. 

You could have a maglev track down the middle and solar panels and batteries be attached to the sides. 

If you then lined up another balloon and another platform, and so on in series, until you had a long track, you would essentially have a mass driver, something we discussed earlier in the series. 

We also discussed, in the mass driver’s episode, how those have big long vacuum tunnels the vehicle races down and how we need the top to exit high in the atmosphere where the air is thin. 

You could hold up that end with balloons. 

We’ve gotten those as high as 50 kilometers, and could probably do higher with some modern materials, but they were not holding up any weight. 

Now a balloon loosely follows the Square-Cube Law, make it twice as wide and it has eight times the lifting force, two-cubed, but only four times the surface area, two-squared. 

If you didn’t need to make the balloon’s surface material thicker to make it bigger, you could make a balloon quite huge. 

A normal rubber balloon’s size is based on the external pressure pushing it to contract, plus the force of that rubber pulling itself to contract, minus the internal pressure of your lifting gas, trying to stretch it. 

We can increase that pressure by heating that gas, or by adding more gas particles, like when you inflate one, but we need it to float so adding more gas isn’t ideal. 

A rigid hollow structure that is airtight could have no lifting gas in it, be a vacuum, like the tubes from the mass drivers. 

Indeed they do have a buoyant force lifting them it is just assumed to be a lot smaller than the sheer weight of all those magnets and air tight walls. 

But if we imagined some very strong airtight material, that was strong and airtight even when only the thickness of aluminum foil, we could build some truly monstrous floating objects, even at high altitudes. 

Indeed at higher altitudes you don’t need the material as strong, since the air pressure outside pushing on it goes down. 

A hollow steel sphere a millimeter thick and 100 meters across, empty of all air, would mass in at a quarter of a million kilograms. 

That’s a volume of just over half a million cubic meters, or 630,000 kilograms of air at normal pressure and temperature. 

That would give you about 380,000 kilograms of lifting mass. 

However, even if it were lifting nothing at all, it would stop rising and float in place when air got down from about 1.2 kilograms a cubic meter to about half a kilogram a cubic meter. 

That would happen at about 8 or 9 kilometers up, which is high but not much higher than mountains, indeed that’s how tall Mount Everest is. 

If we doubled that sphere, 100 meter radius instead of diameter, but could keep the same thickness of steel on the outside, we’d need 4 times the steel to cover it, since it has 4 times the surface area, and we would mass in around a million kilograms, but the volume went up eight-fold, so it will now stop floating up when the density of air around it reaches about half what the previous one did, about 14 kilometers up. 

Now as I mentioned, we’ve gotten balloons a lot higher, up to 50 kilometers, that was simply a quick math example of it, but we can imagine materials strong enough to let us build and float vacuum spheres of quite impressive size quite high in the sky, and suspend the end of a mass driver from them or even an entire mass driver that started up in the sky. 

Also using active support, which we’ll get to in a moment, we can make some very rigid spheres that might be able to float on places like Jupiter or Saturn, where we can’t rely on hydrogen or helium as lifting gas since that is what their atmospheres are made of. 

Our biggest problem making vacuum balloons is that you have to build rather sturdy, and thus heavy, to avoid the outside atmosphere crushing them like an empty beer can. 

But as we will see in a moment when we get into active support, we can make some impressively strong and light objects that way which could allow very strong but light containers. 

Especially circular or spherical ones, as we’ll see with the Orbital Ring next week. 

But a buoyant object doesn’t need to be a sphere, and indeed people have looked into making buoyant towers. 

One whose insides or walls contained either a lifting gas or vacuum. 

Ignoring that wind can cause serious problems for these, you can build some very tall towers. 

They don’t need to be connected to the ground either, you can have floating buildings, you just need to watch your weight. 

Floating condominiums probably would not look kindly on you buying a grandfather piano or two-tons steel safes. 

At the tops of such structures we can launch, but more importantly a vehicle can either run up the side of it picking up speed without burning fuel, or run along a track laid down like a bridge between several towers. 

However there are some real limitations on this, not least being that while you can go wider and get taller, you really have to worry about the wind, and this just isn’t a great approach for moving lots of mass quickly. 

When buoyancy isn’t an option, we still have Active Support available. 

We’ve talked about this before and in detail last episode, but let me review it briefly. 

In active support, unlike passive support, we are constantly pushing on something. 

The simple example would be a piece of paper floating in the air above an air vent, or holding something aloft on a stream of water from a fountain. 

We usually mean something magnetic though, since we can accelerate something electromagnetically, like a small iron ball bearing, and have it slow down or deflect from something magnetic above it without touching it and doing any damage or losing energy to friction. 

Needless to say this would work way better if you have superconductors, especially cheap mass produced warm temperature superconductors. 

From a physics and engineering standpoint, this is easy enough, but it can get quite energy expensive, and of course if you shut off the juice, things fall down. 

Your simplest active support structure, often called a dynamic structure, is basically a levitating pad, a simple form of Space Fountain. 

Tons of small mass drivers down on the ground firing pellets up at the bottom of some pad which are magnetically deflected down or away, imparting their momentum to the pad and keeping it up. 

This works better if there is a long vacuum cylinder up the whole way which has no air resistance inside it, and can also keep the pellets on course, but it isn’t absolutely necessary. 

Without those walls, you can also just raise your pad when you are using it and slow down the matter stream to let it descend gently when not, or just use parachutes and shut it off. 

We usually call this a space fountain. 

It also isn’t hard to rig this up to use that stream to generate electricity up on that pad. 

Same as before, with the floating pads we can lay down a track between them and shoot things down those up to orbital speeds. 

This isn’t as nice as a Launch Loop because it’s not a neat closed system, and so it uses a lot of energy. 

We might not care if we invented fusion and we can also make them more neat and closed systems. 

Beyond just getting into space cheaper, active support is very important for building things that are simply very large. 

The basis for a lot of the megastructures we’ve discussed and very tall buildings, is something I call an Atlas Pillar. 

In its simplest form, this is just a contained space fountain acting as a support pillar, and since we usually think of using these on things like Matrioshka Shell worlds, which is basically where you build a series of relatively thin shells around a planet, each essentially the surface of a new planet, each held up by pillars like these, I call them Atlas Pillars in reference to the Titan of Greek Mythology who held up the sky. 

That image of a single stream of matter holding things up bothers people as flimsy, but it is just a simplification of the concept. 

It wouldn’t be one long hollow cylinder, it might be composed of hundreds or thousands of individual segments stacked next to and on top of each other, themselves working in tandem with other pillars for lots of redundancy. 

A warm temperature superconductor could actually form a closed system, accelerating the particles or rotor up and draining that momentum on the way down to power accelerating it back up again. 

This is a lot like a perpetual motion machine, but those usually supply energy too, this is just 99-100% efficiently recycling it. 

Of course it would doubtless either need maintenance or have a working life after which it needed replacement. 

One using normal superconductors will need coolant supplied constantly, and one not using superconductors will be radiating a lot heat lost in the process and need a steady supply of power. 

Needless to say it’s a good idea to build in batteries and coolant tanks as backups. 

They can break and be sabotaged, but so can any pillar or support, thus, you build for redundancy. 

If you want to build a long runway in space like the Lofstrom Loop, but held up by these instead, and you need one pillar able to hold up a hundred tons every 2 kilometers, you build each pillar to hold 200 tons and put them every kilometer. 

That sort of thing. 

Since you now have a support structure that can handle ridiculous forces, you can build some very tall buildings, things that dwarf modern skyscrapers, or even go up past the sky so they are scraping the stars not the sky. 

These Starscrapers are also cheaper to build in one key respect. 

The most expensive thing about skyscrapers is doing all that construction high up in the air, building from the bottom up. 

You actually can build active support structures from the top down, you start on the ground, build a level, levitate it up, build the next level, levitate those up, and so on. 

It's sort of like those new buildings that we can make with large 3D printers, only backwards, the building just rises up as you go, and hypothetically you could keep adding more height to the thing as it grows. 

I remember a couple months back some architect proposed something called the Analemma Tower, one hanging down from a space elevator to just off the ground. 

It would be hard to forget, over a dozen people messaged me the article and the mods on the channels Facebook Group had to keep deleting redundant postings. 

Very popular, beautiful artwork too, but from an engineering perspective it’s terribly flawed. 

You’re hanging a giant building from the end of a space elevator, tens of thousands of kilometers long, instead of rooting it to the ground a few kilometers below. 

Not an entirely new concept either, I usually have heard these referred to as chandelier cities. 

Of course, if you want a moving city you probably do want to go the hanging route, or just make it buoyant, but if you specifically want a city with no visible connection to the ground for some reason, even though it presumably needs connections for transport of people and supplies, you would just use some thin atlas pillars. 

Remember the rotor for the Lofstrom Loop, the thin metal wire that provided all the support to it, is only 5 centimeters wide, wrist-width, and hollow. 

You can’t see that unless you are pretty close and we can make things harder to see. 

Paint it blue or white, or give it a changing color surface to do the whole chameleon effect. 

You’d want a lot of these and they’d need wider feet to support the ‘legs’, but you could have it ‘walk’ like Baba Yaga’s hut. 

Floating or walking cites always seems a really popular notion, like humanoid battlemechs, everyone likes them but they’ve got no real practical purpose. 

But not everything has to, we wouldn’t have art if it did. 

You could have a building suspended along a space elevator, tethered to the ground or not, but you can have more weight higher up anyway so you might as well build a very long and tall building on the whole length rather than just the end. 

Of course, you can build these starscrapers arbitrarily high which gives us an alternative to a classic space elevator. 

A Space Elevator is tens of thousands of kilometers long, with only the last hundred or so kilometers in the atmosphere, but there’s a lot of concerns where wind and sabotage are concerned there, so you might prefer a more robust space tower rising up above the atmosphere which connects to a space elevator at its top. 

Again though, there are not many limits on how tall an active support structure can be, so you can remove the space elevator and its tensile strength issues entirely from the equation. 

An Active Support Space Elevator can be of any height, and doesn’t require precision manufacture of super-materials like graphene. 

It works anywhere, even on Super-Earths with far more gravity than here. 

You can build them wide enough to run trains up and include multiple redundant active support structures. 

Once you get over the atmosphere you can get rid of all the weight of making the fountain airtight to make it a vacuum too, and like the space elevator as you get further from Earth gravity weakens too, both of which make higher sections easier to build and support. 

Another neat application of Space Towers is with Skyhooks. 

We’ve discussed before how on airless places like the moon a rotating skyhook could swing right down and snatch something off the ground. 

That doesn’t work on Earth because you’ve got kilometers of air the hooks need to swing down through at hypersonic velocities, burning up huge amounts of energy even if the hook doesn’t disintegrate. 

At the top of a space tower though, one rising up just above the atmosphere, you could have a cargo pad suitable for direct pickup with either the rotating skyhook or cardiorotovator design we discussed in that episode. 

We also discussed buoyancy earlier on, and the notion of holding up a launch track using these dynamic structures as support pylons, but we can use active support for buoyancy too. 

Those vacuum balloons I mentioned earlier can be constructed a lot thinner and lighter by using active support to make the skin around them stronger. 

We picture active support as pretty big, but recall that the active support element from the Launch Loop was just a wire 5 centimeters wide and hollow, and that’s intended to be strong enough to support a 5 ton ship and stretch thousands of kilometers. 

You can use that exact same principle, scaled down, say a wire a few millimeters wide and hollow, to craft a series of rings tilted at angles to each other to form a spherical shell for instance, and we will actually discuss using a scaled up version of that concept to create artificial planets briefly next episode. 

But this allows much larger and safer buoyant structures for Earth and for places like Venus or Jupiter. 

Safety is a pretty big concern with an active-support structure, since if you turn off the energy the thing falls down. 

Now in the past we’ve mentioned that you can put explosive bolts on large objects to break it into smaller segments, then let parachutes gently carry them down, and that works here as well, but with a couple notes. 

First, if you go that route you also need to give everything a lateral shove too, otherwise your segments start smacking into each other and higher segments landing on top of lower ones. 

Though space towers do not have to go straight up either, you can build at angles just fine. 

Indeed you might build such structure like the vertices of a pyramid instead of a tower or as large skinny upside-down U. 

We also often think of these as considerably more massive objects too, not wispy structures like a space elevator or launch loop, these are buildings, so the parachute approach gets a bit trickier. 

This is why I wanted to discuss the second point, which is that it’s nonsense to regard active support as somehow more fragile than passive support. 

I’ve already said you’d use multiple redundant atlas pillars in any construct, but I suspect many folks think “Oh, well, someone could still shut the power off for all of those”. 

And they could, they could also go blow up all the support pillars on a conventional bridge or skyscraper. 

People get cautious about safety on any new technology, which is a good thing, but there is such a thing as being overly cautious and active support is just as safe as passive support. 

More so, since it allows stronger structures. 

As to cost, that’s really hard to estimate. 

On the one hand you get a huge cost savings on vertical structures since you can build each level low and push it up then work on the next, which makes it cheaper than traditional tall building methods. 

On the other hand, you do have to provide a constant power flow and quite a lot. 

If you’ve got cheap superconductors, especially room temperature ones, this isn’t a big deal. 

Nor if we’ve got very cheap electricity from fusion. 

Having both would make this approach viable enough I’d expect to see it incorporated into regular architecture. 

This has nothing to do with launch costs though. 

It is the nature of an active support structure that you always have access to energy when on the thing, unlike a space elevator where you either need to beam in power or add a lot of weight running thousands of kilometers of wire, usually very wide wire too. 

So for launching we have no need to carry onboard fuel, the vehicle climbing the tower has all the energy it needs and something to push off, eliminating the need for propellant. 

This allows very low launch costs compared to most systems we’ve looked at, dollars per kilograms, not thousands or hundreds, but then you’ve got to factor in the cost to keep it up there. 

Space Towers are not really our most attractive launch system, in terms of active support the Launch Loop from last episode or the Orbital Ring from the next are more attractive, but they can be quite advantageous and are far better, if you’ve got the energy, than most modern options. 

Though they are useful for defense purposes, where spilling a lot of matter into low orbit, that will then fall down, can be handy. 

It’s one way to clear space garbage from orbit for instance, since whatever you spray up with a space fountain will fall down as will anything that wanders into it. 

But their real value lies in how they can be used for construction of very large objects. 

So while I don’t expect them to play much of a role in getting into space, I actually expect us to see them used a lot more in the future than any other system we have looked at. 

Active support isn’t absolutely necessary for technologically advanced civilizations but it forms the keystone, in a very literal way, to building a lot of the truly impressive structures of the future that we can only dream of now. 

We will also see they are quite valuable, though not absolutely necessary, additions to concept of the Orbital Ring, a truly huge launch structure that wraps around an entire planet, and our topic for next week. 

These structures allows the lifting of massive amounts of cargo into orbit, and at dirt cheap prices, but can also be used to help us go beyond orbit into interplanetary space as well.

Tips from Kardashev 2 Engineers, part 2
---
  
2017-06-08  
https://youtu.be/_S1d_tIDcEk  

---

For those of you just joining us, this is part two of of a collaborative episode with Fraser Cain of Universe Today. 

If you haven’t already seen part one, you should head over and start there first. 

Today we are looking at Kardashev-2 Construction methods, and to make things even better, Fraser and I have been joined by artists Kevin Gill and Sergio Botero who are going to show you some visions of what some of these projects might look like. 

No with no further ado, let’s return to Tips from Type 2 engineers, already in progress. 

In our last episode, we set up shades to block the light from reaching our planets. 

And we did the same with dangerous radiation streaming from the Sun. 

We set up a concentrated magnetic shield at the Mars-Sun L1 Lagrange point, which catches and redirects high energy particles. 

This protects a world from the Sun, but it doesn’t prevent harmful cosmic rays, which can come from any part of the sky. 

  Our own planet Earth has a robust magnetosphere, and it’s the main reason we have air to breath and don’t absorb dangerous radiation from the Sun and space. 

Places like Mars don’t. 

For this purpose, we created artificial magnetospheres. 

We considered trying to get Mars’ core spinning fast and hot so that rapid spinning molten ferromagnetic materials would generate a protective magnetosphere. 

But that was too much effort. 

We didn’t actually care what generated the magnetic field, we just wanted the magnetic field. 

In the end we deployed a constellation of electromagnetic satellites around every world exposed to space. 

These satellites could do double duty, harvesting solar radiation and generating an artificial magnetosphere. 

Cosmic rays and radioactive particles from the Sun were captured and redirected safely away from the world, allowing us to roam freely on the surface. 

Once we had made acquired the resources of every world in the Solar System, we began our next great engineering effort. 

To move and dismantle the worlds themselves. 

To create the optimal configuration that gave us the most living space and the most usable energy. 

We began the construction of our Dyson swarm. 

Moving planets is almost impossible. 

But not completely impossible. 

How do you get all that energy to move a world without melting it? 

The orbital energy of Earth around the Sun is approximately 30 million, trillion, trillion joules. 

That’s equal to all the energy the Sun puts out over a few months. 

Of course, the Sun is slowly warming up, and while estimates vary, it’s generally accepted that in about a billion years it will have warmed up enough that Earth would be uninhabitable. 

Moving the Earth was inevitable. 

To move the Earth outward to counteract the increased solar luminosity, we needed to add orbital energy. 

A lot of energy. 

In Part 1 we discussed using gravity tractors and gravitational slingshots to slowly and steadily move objects around the Solar System. 

This technique works at the largest scales too. 

A gravity tractor could slowly and steadily move an entire planet if you had enough time and fuel. 

Because we already had mastery of all the asteroids in the Solar System, we put them into orbits that swept past worlds. 

Each gravitational slingshot gave or stole orbital momentum from the world, pushing it closer or farther from the Sun. 

We also used orbital mirrors to bounce sunlight from the Sun. 

With enough of them, deflecting their light in the same general directional while maintaining an orbit around the planet, we could move worlds without touching them or heating them up from the light beams. 

With enough satellites to keep the net gravitational force on the planet homogenous, we didn’t have to worry about tidal heating, allowing us to move a planet far faster. 

In the future, we’ll use a king-size version of this to move the entire Solar System, using the star as the power source, called a Shkadov Thruster. 

We will push the Sun and every star we control into a constellation that matches our needs. 

But that’s a problem our Type III civilization engineers will have to worry about. 

We always needed ice. 

For water, for fuel and for air. 

And the outer Solar System had all the ice we could ever need. 

We brought comets and other icy bodies in from the outer Solar System to bring water to the planets we’re terraforming - Mars, Venus, and the large moons of the Solar System. 

Pushing ice is a tricky process, but the comet itself is the source of fuel, either liquid hydrogen and oxygen as the propellants or using the hydrogen for a fusion torch drive. 

However we have an alternative trick we can use. 

We just talked about using energy beams, focused sunlight, lasers, or microwave beams to push objects outward from the sun. 

You can also move inward by reflecting the beam off at an angle, removing orbital momentum. 

This lowers their orbit into the Solar System. 

By setting up energy collectors on comets, we could beam power out them, and use that energy to melt atoms into gas and accelerate them away with a magnetic field, just like an ion drive. 

This let us take high-strength lasers and microwave beams powered from the inner Solar System and use it to tractor comets inward. 

The propellant melted off the comets could carry away far more momentum than the energy beam added, though at the cost of losing some of your mass in the process. 

One by one we identified the icy bodies in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud, installed an ice engine, and pulled them inward, to the places we needed that water the most. 

The day to day energy for our civilization comes from the Sun. 

Solar collectors power the machines, computers and systems that make day-to-day life spanning the Solar System possible. 

Just as the ancient Earth civilizations used hydrocarbons as a store of fuel, we depend on hydrogen. 

We use it for our rocket fuel, to manufacture drinking water, and most importantly, for our fusion reactors. 

We always need more hydrogen. 

Fortunately, the Solar System has provided us with vast repositories of hydrogen: the giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all made up of at least 80% hydrogen. 

But harvesting the planets for their hydrogen isn’t without its challenges. 

For starters, the gravity on the surface of Jupiter is nearly 25 m/s2, which is nearly three times the surface gravity of Earth. 

On top of that, Jupiter’s magnetosphere produces intense radiation fields through its entire system. 

You can’t spend much time near Jupiter without receiving a lethal radiation dose. 

We deploy huge robotic scoopers to swoop down into Jupiter’s gravity well, skim across the upper cloud tops, funneling in as much hydrogen as they can. 

On board compressors liquefy the hydrogen, or refine it into the more energy dense metallic hydrogen. 

The fuel is then distributed across the Solar System through the interplanetary transport network. 

For Uranus and Neptune, where the gravity well is less extreme, we have permanent mining stations which float in the cloud tops, harvesting raw materials for return back to space. 

These factories are a huge improvement over the more expensive scoop ships. 

Smaller cargo ships ferry the deuterium, helium-3 and hydrogen up to orbit, for an energy hungry Solar System. 

In order to construct our Dyson Swarm, we will eventually need to dismantle almost all the planets and moons in the Solar System to provide the raw materials to house countless people. 

This process has begun, and we we have a number of options. 

For some worlds, we plan to just keep mining and refining them with robotic factories until they are gone, but this can be quite time consuming and often we would rather do our refining and manufacturing elsewhere. 

Instead, we have set up very large mass drivers running around the object to launch material directly towards its desired destination. 

To avoid building up angular momentum inside the shrinking mass of the planetoid, we run these giant cannons in both directions. 

This prevents it spinning so fast that it tears itself apart. 

There’s very little gravity holding these objects together after all. 

For the smaller objects that’s actually just fine. 

When we want to disassemble a smaller asteroid or moon into rock and dirt for the inside of a cylinder habitat, we construct a cylindrical shell around the asteroid, and spray material from the asteroid onto the cylinder, giving it some spin and artificial gravity to hold the material up, or rather down to its surface. 

We spin the asteroid faster and faster until it flies apart, transferring its material and its angular momentum to the cylinder. 

With larger asteroids we send a series of cylinders past them in a chain, painting their interiors with the material we will turn into dirt later on, until we run out of asteroid. 

For full blown minor planets and moons, which are much more massive but still fairly low in gravity and lacking an atmosphere, we pump matter up tubes to high above the planetoid to fill freighters, get compacted into cannon balls to be launched elsewhere, or simply pumped into rotating habitats being built nearby. 

Mercury is already half consumed. 

In a few more generations, it will be a distant memory. 

Perhaps our greatest accomplishment is the work underway at Jupiter and Saturn. 

We are now in the process of dismantling these worlds to harvest their resources. 

The largest machines humanity has ever built, fusion candles, have been deployed into the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. 

These enormous machines scoop up raw hydrogen from Jupiter to run their fusion reactors. 

One side of the fusion candle fires downward, keeping the machine aloft. 

The other end blasts out into space, spewing material that can be harvested from orbit. 

Not only that, but these candles provide thrust, pushing Jupiter and Saturn slowly but steadily into safer, more useful orbits for our civilization. 

As we use up the hydrogen, their mass will decrease. 

Uranus and Neptune will follow slowly, from farther out in the Solar System. 

Eventually, eons into the future, we will have dismantled them down to their cores. 

There is more than a dozen times the mass of the Earth in rock and metal down at the core of Jupiter. 

More raw materials than any other place in the Solar System. 

The long awaited construction of our fully operational Dyson swarm will finally begin. 

We’ll miss the presence of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System, and remember them fondly, but humanity needs room to stretch its legs. 

Of course, as huge as the gas giants are compared to Earth, the Sun is far bigger, and contains not just hydrogen and helium but thousands of planets worth of heavier elements, which are spread around the sun, not just concentrated deep down. 

Trying to scoop matter off a star is much harder than out of gas giant, though conveniently, we can take advantage of all that energy the Sun is giving off to power our extraction. 

The material on the Sun is also ionized, so it reacts strongly to magnetic forces, and the Sun generates a massively powerful magnetic field too. 

In fact, our Sun ejects about a billion kilograms of matter a second as solar wind. 

We have a few ways to increase this flow and harvest it. 

The first is called Thermal Driven Outflow. 

We hover mirrors over the surface, reflecting and concentrating light down on spots on the Sun’s surface to heat it up and increase the mass being ejected. 

This kicks up an eruption much like a solar flare, feeding more solar wind. 

We then place a large ring of satellites around the Sun’s equator, connected to each other by a stream of ionized particles generating a huge current, themselves running that stream off solar power. 

This ring creates a powerful magnetic field pushing outward toward the Sun’s poles, and sending the super-heated matter in that direction. 

Hovering over the poles further out, we have a giant ring sucking up sunlight and generating a huge toroidal magnetic field. 

All the matter we stir up on the sun and off the poles is sucked through that and slowed down for collection. 

It’s a lot like the VASIMR Drive, using a magnetic nozzle, so that nothing has to touch the ultra hot plasma. 

Giant Plasma Thrusters essentially acting as the pump to gather the matter, it stays in place using the momentum it’s stealing from the particles it is slowing down, again it’s a giant plasma thruster. 

We will eventually build far more of these rings around the Sun, spaced up and down from the equator, and intermittently shut off the power beam holding them aloft. 

As all the satellites in that ring drop, building up speed, we switch the power for the beam back on and their plummet stops and they push back up to their original position. 

We do this with all the rings, in sequence, pushing much larger waves of matter toward the poles than the Thermal Driven Outflow method provides, and we call this option the Huff-n-Puff Method. 

And there you have it, our tips and techniques to harvest all the resources from the Solar System. 

To push and pull worlds, to heat them up, cool them down and use their raw materials to house humanity’s growing, ever expanding population. 

As we nearly achieve our Type II civilization status, and control all the energy from our Sun and all the resources of the Solar System, we set our sights on a new goal: doing the same thing for the entire Milky Way Galaxy. 

Perhaps in a few million years, we’ll create another guide for you, to help you make this transition as efficiently as possible. 

Good luck!

SFIA 100k Subscribers Special
---
  
2017-06-28  
https://youtu.be/UUMrT6QaSKc  

---

It seems like just yesterday we were celebrating hitting 10,000 subscribers, today we’ve reached 100,000 and there’s plenty of room to go. 

So today is a special episode celebrating the 100,000th subscriber to the channel and I have no idea what day this will air, though it’s Memorial Day as I write this. 

It’s customary to make a special 100k episode on Youtube because it’s a more than symbolic benchmark. 

Typically after you get past 10,000 subscribers Youtube formally contacts you to offer some advice and options, you’re on their radar in a formal sense, but at 100,000 you get the Silver Creator play button award as a thanks from them, and I gather they give you a gift card too. 

I’d considered celebrating 100,000 subscribers with a video discussing the year 100,000 AD, but the custom is to thank the viewers and talk a bit about your channel and yourself, so we’ll save that for another day. 

I’m not a big one on biography but I’ll do a little of that today, and of course while I do want to thank my viewers, and the patrons who fund this channel, I also wanted to thank a few other channels who’ve helped me learn the ropes and a lot of the artists and musicians whose work seriously enhances the quality of these episodes compared to the early days. 

Those early days and the channel’s origins are a bit peculiar. 

Mostly because I never meant there to be one. 

Some folks who have noticed that I started labeling videos this year by season and episode order, 2017 being season 3, making 2015 season 1, might note that the oldest episode is actually from 2014 and the channel has existed since 2012. 

For official purposes I consider that episode the ‘pilot’ or episode 0, but the handful of subscribers from the very beginning might remember I used to have other videos up there. 

That’s because I just had a regular old account I used sometimes to upload home videos or presentations to for storage. 

At one point I wanted to try Powerpoint’s built in tool for letting you record narrations and export a slideshow as a video, as an experiment for some other projects I was doing. 

I was a member of scifi worldbuilding group at the time, an author friend of mine suggested it to me as a fun place to bounce ideas around. 

I have a notorious dislike for scifi’s habit of always setting everything on planets and often advocated more space stations and megastructures as settings, so I decided to do my practice run on that topic and upload it to youtube to post it to that group. 

I could just link it instead of re-typing my arguments. 

Some months later I did the same thing for another group I was involved in on the Fermi Paradox. 

Thus was the channel born. 

Well not quite, it was some months before I deleted older home videos and almost a year before I decided to do regular episodes, and just over a year ago that I switched over to the regular weekly schedule. 

This though is one of the reasons why the episodes are visual imagery with me talking over them. 

The second reason being that my favorite online show, SF Debris hosted by Chuck Sonnenburg, is him reviewing scifi films and shows with just clips of the shows he talks over top of. 

I liked this format as I’d found a lot of the other review shows a bit distracting with the host showing up on screen and often doing skits, which wasn’t my cup of tea. 

The third reason is that I started rendering the episodes in 1080p HD, and my webcam is lower resolution than that, just one I use for playing Dungeons and Dragons with some friends in another state. 

In fact I developed most of my video production skills doing fun little videos for that gaming group. 

Reason 4 is that shooting video at decent quality takes a lot of skill and a lot of takes, and even just recording the audio for these can take a couple hours. 

If you visit some of sibling channels where they do a live presenter in front of camera for 5-20 minutes, take my word for it, there’s was a lot more setup time and recording time than 5-20 minutes. 

I was little surprised some folks thought I was a recluse, same as folks often figure I use a pseudonym for the channel. 

Originally there were a bunch of home videos with me in them and my pictures been in several episodes starting from the second one. 

I’ve even filmed a short channel update video for the Facebook Group, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, of me just talking into the aforementioned webcam. 

I don’t use photos of me on the channel much either, the one most probably know is a photoshop of the command and control center I use for episodes set on the spaceship unity, from the life in a space colony trilogy. 

That’s actually quite old, from 2006, but was the only picture of me in uniform sitting down that I could find. 

It’s from my tent in Tel Afar Iraq, which was my home and workshop for the first half of the 14 months I spent in Iraq. 

We used to play a fair amount of D&amp;D down there in our tiny amounts of free time too, it doesn’t require electricity which is handy, and I actually still play with one of my brethren from then, my best friend, who runs the group in another state I mentioned. 

He’s also one of my sounding boards for the channel, I’ve been bouncing these ideas off him for well over a decade. 

I’ve mentioned it on the channel a time or too but I served with the US Army from 2003 to 2010. 

I’d been intending to go back to college and finish my doctorate afterwards but I lost my taste for academia by then. 

Actually I lost it maybe a year into grad school but I figured it might come back after I went and saw more of the world. 

I love my field, and I do enjoy teaching, but only to crowds who are interested, and the idea of spending my life on a campus just lost its appeal. 

You have to love what you’re doing or you generally won’t do it well, and while it’s a good idea to press on into the storm for a while to see if things change, if they don’t its best to make changes. 

That was a big change for me because becoming a scientist had been something I was set on since I was a little kid. 

My parents were both physics majors when they met and got married, probably not too surprising since my full name is Isaac Albert Arthur, though I am also named after Isaac Asimov and my family always has an Alan or Chester in the name somewhere, so the ‘Al’ in Albert did double duty I suppose. 

Most of the men in my family have been in the military too, so that wasn’t surprising either. 

I count both as very positive experiences overall and had and have many good friends and mentors from both of those periods of my life. 

Anyway I was raised by mother and my Grandfather, Alan Arthur, both of whom were geeks, as is my older sister, so it’s no surprise I had a big interest in science and science fiction. 

I started school young, left it in favor of homeschooling at 10, skipped a couple grades, tried high school briefly and dropped out when I was 12. 

And yes I am a genuine high school dropout complete with GED, I basically stayed home by myself and read all day till I was 16. 

When I did finally get to college I had some excellent professors, and also found out how handy study groups were. 

Fundamentally all learning is self-taught, especially when you get past the basics, but it does help to have mentors and companions for that journey. 

If you’re curious I graduated with a bachelor’s in Physics from Kent State University in 2001, when I was 20. 

I was top of my class so I got offered a generous teaching and research stipend to stick around for grad school which I did for a few years, studying under Theorist Mike Lee. 

I was originally planning to go into Nuclear and Particle Physics, indeed my college ring, the only bit of jewelry I ever wear besides my dogtags, has a big Bohr-style atom on it with that in mind, as the jeweler didn’t have a mushroom cloud available. 

But I ended up studying Biophysics, with a focus on Mitochondria and molecular motors. 

Probably a mistake as I absolutely hated it, but the genome project was just wrapping up then and my advisor and I both thought it sounded interesting. 

Indeed it is, but it wasn’t my sup of tea. 

In any event one day I called up a recruiter and a week later I was a Fort Sill in Oklahoma, and a few months later I was stationed to Giessen, Germany, just a little ways north of Frankfurt. 

Giessen is a beautiful town and I highly recommend it should you be in the area, though Ohio is and always has been the place I call home and there’s no place I’d rather be. 

After the military I went home to Ohio and after twiddling my thumbs for a bit I went into local governance and politics, I do a lot analysis and advising. 

Though my official position is Board Member on the Board of Elections, by appointment of the Secretary of State, and I’m in my second term of office. 

I consider it quite an honor too, I received unanimous bipartisan approval for my reappointment and am to the best of my knowledge the youngest to hold the office in the state. 

I’m also firmly committed to keeping the channel apolitical, and I find war stories to be morbid affairs at best, so I typically avoid mentioning either on the channel. 

I’d probably have bypassed it entirely if it weren’t Memorial Day, which puts absent friends to mind. 

If that’s your cup of tea, my first sergeant published his memoirs after he retired last year, and I show up in there a few times. 

It’s fairly graphic and violent as you might expect from someone who served in ground combat in every US conflict since Grenada, but it’s not gratuitous, and there is no person on this planet I respect more than him, which says a lot since I’ve had no shortage of admirable people in my life and many of them from that unit. 

Those were exciting times but I have, thankfully, led a pretty boring life in recent years. 

I also can’t remember ever being happier in life, and this channel is a big part of that. 

What else is there? 

We do talk scifi on the channel a lot and folks do ask who my favorite writers are or for reading recommendations, but I once decided to test Facebook’s reading recommendation ability by pumping in several hundred novels I’ve read and rating them 1-5 stars, and my facebook page is public, so I just send curious folks there. 

It’s not complete and I don’t update it much, but it lists a ton of them and films and shows too. 

These days I listen to audiobooks more than read, my favorite narrator is John Lee. 

My favorite musician incidentally is Sting, which I will use to segue back to discussing the channel. 

I use a lot of graphics and music from Public Domain and Creative Commons sources, NASA is unsurprisingly one of those but Pixabay is another, and I did want to thank every artist who contributes their work there for others to use, and the same for the Free Music Archive. 

These days I use a lot of graphics and music contributed to the channel by their artists and composers, but I wanted to give a shout out to the folks who donate their work for general use by all. 

It really is amazing getting to work directly with those artists and musicians these days though and I hope you will check out their other work, and for the music get to listen to them at full volume for a change. 

I do always include every song used in an episode in chronological order in the credits at the end, something which a lot of folks miss. 

“Who did that song?” is probably the second most commonly asked question on the channel, right after “What is that accent?” And yeah I do tend to find my speech impediment amusing, if you can’t laugh at yourself life will get pretty boring pretty quick. 

Anyway I get complimented on it more often than the reverse, I don’t think I ever got insulted about it till the channel, and this is the internet after all so a thick skin is a necessity. 

It gets brought up a lot in older videos because I didn’t want folks distracted wondering about it while watching the material, these day I just use the Elmer Fudd Grpahic. 

Speaking of Graphics, I wanted to thank Jakub Grygier who started doing the cover art, the thumbnails, for the channel about a year ago. 

For the longest time it was just him and me working on the channel, and Luis handling the website, with occasional help from some others. 

A couple months ago I also put out the call for volunteers to help with the graphics and script editing, and we’re always looking for more volunteers helping on the graphics. 

It’s been wonderful having folks helping out with that, and they do get named in the credits at the end of episodes. 

But all the mods and admins from the facebook group, the reddit group, or the youtube comments section do not, all of whom volunteer tons of time to managing those. 

It also doesn’t include all the folks who have translated the subtitles for this channel into other languages. 

So I wanted to take a moment to thank all of them too. 

I also to want to thank a few of the channels who have provided me a lot help and advice this last year. 

Joe Scott from Answers with Joe, who got into the game around the same time I did and who I did my first collaboration episode with. 

Fraser Cain of Universe Today, whose publication I’ve been reading for a long time and who is my main source for astronomy updates over the years along with Paul Gilster of Centuari Dreams. 

And last but hardly least, Cody don Reeder of Cody’s Lab, who gave me a lot of great advice on running a channel, which is not surprising for someone who has over a million subscribers. 

He’s also recommended my channel to his audience more than once and that’s quite an honor. 

He mentioned at the time someone doing that for him once and believing in paying it forward, and I try to espouse the same attitude when contacted by other channels just getting started. 

Though I think if I had to give one single piece of advice to aspiring creators, it would be always to respect your audience. 

Don’t ever dumb your material down or hype it up. 

No video should be needlessly long, and every artist has to find their right style, for some that is short and intense, but don’t feel constrained to the common wisdom that you need to go short and simple. 

As this channel proves, there is a big niche for in-depth discussion of concepts. 

I know everyone says their audience is the best, and I suspect most sincerely believe that too, I know I do and it’s probably a point against me that I tend to be terribly smug about my audience. 

It ranges from folks with no formal education to professors, but they, you, all seem to share that passion for knowledge that makes discussing these topics so rewarding. 

I remember teaching, and have a lot friends who do it for a living, so I know how draining it can be trying to stoke the fires of curiosity in a class, but I won’t deny that it’s a bit thrilling to go out every Thursday morning and share these topics with a crowd who already enjoys it and is also big enough to fill a stadium. 

Pretty intimidating at times too, though I’d still recommend giving it a try to anyone with some expertise on a topic who wants to share that with others. 

It’s a fascinating emerging industry, only time will tell how well it will prosper and change, but it’s neat to be involved in. 

It wouldn’t be possible without places like Youtube providing a forum and Patreon allowing a safe and easy way for folks to crowd-source these things. 

I mostly eschew ads on the channel, there are some features only available to creators on Youtube who monetize their videos so I do some and it does bring in some revenue, but funding for the channel mostly comes through Patreon and my patrons there. 

There are over 400 of them these days, and many of them value their privacy, so I won’t display all of them now, but beyond my own personal gratitude for their generosity I think they deserve a round of applause for helping to keep this channel going, and while I hope some of you will join their number, I’d also encourage you to donate to other channels you like and places like the Free Music Archive and Pixabay and the various artists, composers, and creators who donate their time and labors for others to use. 

I’m not one for knocking the big networks and studios, but I think we benefit a lot from independent small groups and individuals getting involved in these enterprises and this simple donation and crowd-sourcing method that’s been emerging makes that much easier. 

It’s really an amazing aspect of the world we live in today that such resources are available. 

Folks occasionally challenge my general optimism about the future and point to bleaker aspects of human nature as examples, stuff like that is just one of many examples I keep in mind that keeps me upbeat about humanity. 

We are race of thinkers and dreamers, hopers and builders, and I never need to look further than the comments section on my channel for a reminder of that. 

I think on that note we’ll close out for today. 

It’s been a long march to 100,000 subscribers, and will be a longer one to a million if we ever get there, but even if I never get another subscriber I will count myself lucky for this experience and am grateful to all of you for tuning in every week. 

As always, thanks for watching, and have a great week!

Launch Loops

---

Hanging a 2000 kilometer long railroad in the sky, suspended 80 kilometers in the air, might seem rather fanciful, but as we will see today, it turns out to be a pretty cheap and practical option for space travel. 

Whenever we see a rocket launch, it is going straight upwards, which often seems a bit confusing since the velocity needed to orbit the Earth is side-to-side, not upward. 

Of course rockets do need to get up a ways, so that they don’t crash into a mountain or anything. 

After rockets rise a bit and clear most of the atmosphere they fall over on their side in a gravity turn and accelerate laterally instead. 

On places like the Moon, where there’s virtually no atmosphere, rockets don’t need to take off straight up, they can go straight down a runway. 

With no air to generate lift they will stick to that runway until their speed reaches orbital velocities. 

That is after all what orbital velocity is, the speed necessary to move sideways faster than gravity pulls you down, so the curvature of the planet, the horizon, slopes away as fast as you fall down toward it. 

Now it would be nice to have a runway on Earth up above the atmosphere so you could do the same, but this still has limited advantages. 

The nice thing about a runway is that it gives you something to push off, instead of tossing matter out the back of your spaceship to do your pushing. 

You still need energy to do that pushing, so a very good runway would provide you that energy too. 

The conceptually simplest approach is an electric motor spinning wheels that are running over the top of a long heavy gauge wire that is conducting electricity. 

The vehicle has a metal brush on the bottom that brushes along that wire permitting the electricity to flow from it to the electric motor. 

Such a magical runway, up above the atmosphere, would allow you to drive an electric car up to orbital speeds and right into orbit. 

Now our topic for today, the launch loop, is a little more sophisticated than this, but the basic concept is the same... suspend a runway in the upper atmosphere that provides a spaceship something to push against and the energy to do that pushing, so that it doesn’t need onboard fuel. 

Not very complicated conceptually, but this runway does need to be thousands of kilometers long and a hundred kilometers above the ground, something which is more easily said than done. 

So is transferring power to that vehicle, or pushing against that runway, when the vehicle is moving thousands of meters a second. 

You can’t exactly rely on rubber wheels or metal brushes at those speeds, the friction would vaporize them in an instant. 

We get around the contact issue by avoiding it, and use magnetic levitation, just as with MagLev Bullet Trains. 

But our solution to height is something called Active Support, and it’s going to form the basis for today’s launch system as well as the ones we’ll be discussing in the next two episodes of this series. 

In this respect, they essentially form a connected trilogy and will finish off the main portion of this series. 

I won’t say close it out, because we’ll probably come back, but these three episodes cover the big ticket items that form the basis for a truly high-capacity launch system. 

We will be looking at the simplest forms, ones that we could build now for fairly reasonable prices and use for relatively normal launches, and also the scaled up versions capable of lifting megatons of freight and passengers into space which include all three systems working in tandem as a hybrid form. 

Now every episode in this series is supposed to be essentially self-contained, so I will discuss active support in each, but this episode will feature the more detailed explanation and I recommend watching them in the following order: Launch Loops, then Space Towers, then Orbital Rings. 

Active support is our method for overcoming the limits nature imposes on compressive or tensile strength. 

We discussed those earlier in the series, but the short form is that while it is possible to build giant pylons to hold a runway or railroad track aloft a hundred kilometers, it's not particularly practical. 

And we definitely do want that runway or railroad track. 

Fundamentally, every system we’ve discussed has either involved making rockets more powerful or cheaper, or getting around the rocket equation by letting us supply energy to a ship, and provide something for it to push off or with, without having to carry that energy and propellant along. 

Let’s start by reminding ourselves what passive support is. 

Most structures are passively supported by their various load-bearing members. 

Weight rests on them and compresses them, and so long as you don’t put too much weight on them, all is well. 

How much is too much depends on the material and its compressive strength. 

You can also go the reverse way and pull on things, placing them under tension, like suspending yourself from a rope. 

Too much weight on that rope, too much tension, and it will break. 

How much is too much depends on the material and its tensile strength. 

Very long or tall things have to carry not only the weight of whatever you want to hold up, or hang up, but also their own weight pushing on lower levels or pulling on higher ones. 

As we discussed in the Space Elevator episode, we can increase this distance by either lowering gravity, like building on the Moon or Mars, or by tapering the load-bearing element, making it wider at the bottom for compressive strength or wider at the top for tensile. 

No matter what though, you begin to hit practical limits. 

These materials are relying on the binding forces either holding molecules together or keeping them apart. 

We often discuss super materials capable of stretching thousands of kilometers into the air, like carbon nanotubes, but even then it would require pushing those boundaries quite a bit to allow us to make a space elevator, let alone what we want, which is more extreme. 

Not just holding a smaller tower or spaceship up, but holding up an entire city, or even hanging a planet or black hole over a city. 

Active Support does let us do such things. 

So what is Active Support? 

Exactly what it sounds like, you are actively pushing upwards on something to keep it from falling. 

What keeps a rocket from falling down when it’s a hundred meters above the pad? 

A big stream of superheated propellant shooting out the back, countering gravity’s pull. 

We have as many ways to provide active support as we have ways of pushing on things, but the key trick is doing it in as close-looped a way as possible. 

Short of a perpetual motion machine you can't close it completely, and you will need to add energy, which seems to be a turnoff for many folks, but keep in mind that every structure requires energy and resources to maintain. 

Incidentally that closed-loop part is why today’s structure is called a launch ‘loop’. 

Let’s begin with the simplest active support system we can make. 

A fan or heating vent pointed upward with a sheet of paper floating on it. 

That is active support. 

Shut off the air and the paper falls. 

You could also do this with a firehose, aimed upward to push on the bottom of a plastic plate. 

If the stream of water is perfectly aimed and the water pressure maintained, it can hold the plate aloft indefinitely. 

If we felt like making that plate out of bullet-proof armor, you could actively support it by having a squad of soldiers firing machine guns at it from below. 

Basically this is how the Space Towers work, which we will discuss in the next episode. 

We often call these dynamic structures, in part because we can actually change their height. 

The launch loop is one such dynamic structure, which takes a slightly different approach to active support. 

Simply put, we turn on the support and a giant runway lifts up from the ocean. 

There are actually a few types of Launch Loops but the best known version, which itself has a few variations, is the one we usually call the Lofstrom Loop, proposed by Keith Lofstrom way back in 1981. 

He has improved upon the design and explanation since then and I will include his 2009 write up on it in the episode description. 

He’s quite detailed but keeps to pretty simple language and it explains it well, so I will use his example of the concept. 

Imagine a stream of water from a hose pointed at an angle into the sky. 

The Stream forms a parabolic arc, each particle is rising and falling on a ballistic trajectory, forming a parabola controlled by the speed and angle the water comes out at. 

Much as an artillery shell’s ballistic track can exceed the height of any building we’ve ever made, this stream of water, if fast enough, could form a big arc kilometers high, and since we are constantly adding more water this arch will remain. 

You could keep things up at the top of it by letting water bounce off the bottom of them. 

Of course anything you had up there would move in the direction the water was going, but we could make a second stream of water running backwards, forming a second arch pushing the opposite way, and we could put a plate on top of both so it didn’t drift either way. 

Now if we had a big basin at either end, we could catch the water falling from one stream and pump it back up in the other stream. 

Now you are probably thinking of a few problems with this concept. 

First the water isn’t going to stay in a nice neat stream and land in that basin, second that plate might not drift forward or back but it will probably spin, and third, it takes a lot of energy to shoot water. 

We can fix these though, and we won’t be using water for the loop anyway, but imagine we wrapped a thin hose around the stream to keep the water in, and now that plate up top is resting on the two hoses and so not spinning. 

We could also make the water go in a circuit, conserving power. 

You still need to supply power, it’s not a perpetual motion machine, but we can save a lot of energy that way. 

Also, we can slowly turn the pressure down, then off, and lower the hoses to the ground when not in use. 

That’s saves a lot of power too, and illustrates another reason why we call it a dynamic structure, since we can change its shape as well as adjust the elevation. 

You might be wondering how this qualifies as a flat runway or track, since it is clearly a parabola, not a straight line. 

But keep in mind that a track a couple thousand kilometers long and staying at the same altitude above Earth is not a straight line either, anymore than Earth is flat. 

If we are firing artillery shells or water streams in parabolas, by shooting them faster and faster, you eventually reach a speed where it turns into a circle instead, since it is actually now in orbit. 

This is exactly how early, pre-rocketry designs for spaceflight worked, build a cannon so big that it no longer shooting parabolic trajectories, since the range is so large you can no longer treat the Earth as flat. 

That’s the concept, and we would make very big hoses and lay down a platform over them with a way to transfer power to the spaceship we are launching, an electrified track for instance. 

Now the actual Lofstrom Loop doesn’t use water, though it is typically over an ocean since that’s a nice safe empty place to build one. 

Instead it uses a stream of iron running down a vacuum tube. 

This can be a series of connected metal balls or links, like a big bike chain, of magnetically sensitive material. 

However Lofstrom’s loop is simply one long hollow wire, or hollow iron cylinder, called the rotor. 

It is only 5 centimeters wide, and with the walls .25 centimeters thick, and presumably several thousand kilometers long. 

That is very flexible by the way, it is not a rigid iron rod, just a metal wire that’s rather thick and hollow. 

You will use whatever the engineers decide is most practical, a big particle accelerator works too, basically though it’s a stream of matter running around inside a vacuum tube, never touching the sides, pushed away by magnetics, so there is no friction. 

It just keeps looping around, though you doubtless lose some energy, and with superconducting magnets you would lose even less. 

Lofstrom’s loop is 2000 kilometers long and 80 kilometers high, it also masses several kilograms per meter giving the whole loop a mass of several thousand tons, the rotor alone comes in at about 16,000. 

Which is actually quite light for something as long as an interstate highway. 

Needless to say you can scale it up but it's big enough for a 5000 kilogram vehicle in this design. 

Lofstrom works through virtually every conceivable detail and scenario in his paper, which again is attached in the episode description, down to the power requirements and individual components for this size of loop, so I’ll stick with that for specifics. 

Again it can be scaled up, and I’d assume loosely linearly, double launch mass, double loop mass, and power and financial costs. 

More on those in a bit. 

So why 2000 kilometers long and 80 kilometers high? 

For the former, that’s just how long you need to accelerate at 3 gees to reach orbital velocity, same as the mass drivers we discussed before and you can make it longer if you want to accelerate slower or make it shorter if you can handle more acceleration. 

Like the mass driver this can be combined with a sky hook to let you go shorter on the track. 

Why 80 kilometers? 

There is a good reason but it can be lower or higher. 

So low in fact you could use this as a bridge between islands. 

However, 80 kilometers is high enough to be over most of the atmosphere and avoid serious drag effects on the vehicle, but still low enough that many meteors will be vaporized before hitting the Loop, and probably more importantly there are no stable orbits for space trash to follow and collide with your Loop. 

There’s not much air there to drag on our spaceship, but it's still enough to cause a fast decay for anything orbiting at that height. 

The launch vehicle itself rides on top of magnets and is just like a maglev bullet train, but with no air to interfere, or at least very little. 

It takes momentum from the rotor, which needs to be replaced, but needs no on board fuel. 

This would be a space plane design, and carry only what fuel it needed for maneuvering in orbit or going higher, though a longer loop could launch you into higher orbits. 

You would land conventionally, using aerobraking like the shuttle did. 

It is possible to land on such a loop too, where aerobraking isn’t an option, but one has no reason to build such a system where that’s the case. 

Unlike a lot of our other systems, the Launch Loop is mostly only useful for Earth. 

It serves no purpose on the Moon, where there is no atmosphere to be above, and you would only be elevating your track to avoid local geography... crater walls, hills, and other possible obstructions. 

That low gravity and low altitude allows normal supports to lift your track. 

The launch loop is only necessary where you have an atmosphere. 

One place it would be very handy is Venus. 

You can for instance float a mass driver in Venus’s very thick atmosphere, but not only do you still need a wide thick vacuum tube, not a small one just big enough for the 5 centimeter wide rotor, but you also can only float stuff using buoyancy as high as your lifting gas permits. 

Here on Earth we’ve gotten balloons 50 kilometers high but that is not 80 kilometers and they were nothing but balloon. 

We weren’t hanging heavy masses on them either. 

However with a Launch Loop on Venus you can put the lower part of the structure down where even normal air is a good lifting gas and let the active support lift the higher portions up to where the atmosphere is too thin for buoyancy alone. 

You can use this trick with gas giants too, but it requires some extra effort, they tend to be quite thin and composed of hydrogen and helium, our two preferred lifting gases, so you have to use things like vacuum balloons, which we’ll discuss next episode, or more active support structures like the Orbital Ring. 

So how safe is the loop? 

More or less the same safety factor as a mass driver, but that rotor, the big long metal wire running around the loop, is carrying a ton of energy. 

Actually its carrying about a megaton of energy, in terms of explosive yield. 

So essentially there’s a decent sized nuke’s worth of juice running around that loop, but even if the thing blew apart, that energy is 80 kilometers up and spread over 2000 kilometers, and it not radioactive. 

For that matter the rotor is traveling at orbital velocities, so a lot of it would fly up into orbit or even beyond, since the default speed of the rotor exceeds Earth’s escape velocity. 

The track itself would just fall, and we could use explosives to break it into chunks and let parachutes bring it down. 

Having the rotor slice its way out of the conduit is going to severely damage it too, so breaking it up with explosive bolts isn’t a big deal since you will be needing to replace lots of conduit anyway. 

Also, it’s a good idea to design it to float on water as well. 

That’s for a critical failure, you can also lower it by just shutting off the power, it will actually take quite some time to descend that way. 

It’s usually assumed to run on a few hundred megawatts, replacing lost power, and it takes days to raise or lower that way, though you can add more power to raise it faster. 

You normally wouldn’t build these near cities though, and oceans are considered preferable to land. 

This lets you put it down near the equator and it can float on the surface while you’re doing repairs or replacing a segment. 

A scaled up version could include a lot more redundancies, additional loops and so on, but it would also have more energy in it so you might hesitate to put it near a city as well. 

But these can be any length or angle you want, so you could actually run it between two cities and have a very fast bullet train between them. 

They also normally have tethers coming off the sides to help stabilize it like guy wires. 

A very scaled up version of this could actually use those tethers as entry ramps from other places, if you were building over land. 

These are the sorts of things you would need to plan for, and Lofstrom goes into just about every safety factor and concern I can think of in his paper so I will refer you to that, again linked in the episode description. 

There are quite a few though, it is a bit of engineering nightmare with only our current technology, but it does appear doable. 

As to cost, here’s the fun bit. 

Again Lofstrom was very detailed with this, down to tables for individual parts, and he gives an estimate including research costs to build the loop of just 2 billion dollars, and an average launch cost of $3 per kilogram. 

It actually beats the space elevator. 

He also only uses components and technology we already have, and again we don’t need mass produced carbon nanotubes like for the space elevator. 

All of which sounds excellent but it does have some problems. 

First off, being that long and relatively flimsy, you do have to worry about weather a lot more, especially down at the loops and inclines running up. 

It also runs very hot, though that issue is eliminated if you have superconductors in play, and the price to run it would drop a bit too. 

You are stealing your launch energy from the rotor and have to put that back, and if you want to be running constant launches you need two big power plants at either side of it. 

Personally, I love the Launch Loop, especially when combined with skyhooks so that you can lower the track length and energies involved. 

Fundamentally it is a lot like the mass driver but you get to skip on the big expensive vacuum tunnel as wide as your ship in favor of one about as wide as your wrist and avoid the issue of trying to hold the tunnel high up in the air. 

Of course holding much heavier objects like that tunnel stationary at high altitudes would be handy too, and we will be examining those methods in our next episode, “Space Towers.” We will look at using Active Support for that as well and also take some time to discuss buoyancy options like balloons or even towers made of buoyant segments. 

After that we will finally move onto the Orbital Ring and explain a lot of the hybrid options we can use with that to create the kind of massive orbital infrastructure a civilization needs if it wants to be moving millions of people and millions of tons of cargo back and forth from Earth to orbit on a daily basis.

From oracles to fortune tellers, humanity has been trying to predict the future for as long as we’ve been around. But Stock market and election predictions show that even modern techniques often aren’t much better than just looking at tea leaves or crystal balls. 

So today’s topic is predicting the future, with a special focus on the concept called Psychohistory which originated in Isaac Asimov’s classic Foundation Series. There is a reason why The Foundation tops just about every list of best sci-fi novels and series; it’s a great story with a fascinating concept, but odds are a lot of you haven’t read it yet, so I will try to avoid spoilers where possible. 

We’ll get to psychohistory, and why it differs from other predictive options, in just a moment. First, let me emphasize that to forecast the future with 100% accuracy is not possible, even if we ignore random factors percolating up from the quantum scale. 

We proved this just a couple weeks back in the Infinite Improbability Issues Episode. 

Even in a truly mechanistic, predetermined Universe, you could not keep track&nbsp;of every particle’s interaction with a computer smaller than the Universe itself. 

Even if you could, both your observations of those particles as well as the energies and interactions of that super-computer would alter that system, throwing off your calculations. 

To accurately model a system, it needs to obey certain parameters that permit it to be modeled by something smaller and simpler than itself. Solar Systems are a great example because planets are huge objects that are very hard to impact in a meaningful fashion. We can predict where planets will be centuries in advance with very high accuracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, minor perturbations in the system do begin to stack up, making accurate prediction increasingly difficult the further ahead in time you try to predict. Every time you add another variable to the system, the number of possible perturbations increases as well, creating a snowball effect over time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can make reliable predictions about planets, even though they are huge, and contain complex, unpredictable systems like weather and civilizations, because these systems don’t spill over to solar scale. A hurricane on Earth doesn’t matter much in terms of Earth’s gravitational pull on Jupiter, nor does it matter who wins Best Pie at this year’s county fair in Jefferson, Ohio… “much” being a key-word of course. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hurricane for instance, represents a non-homogenous distribution of Earth’s mass, and while the effect is small on Earth’s gravity, the force exerted by Earth on Mars or Jupiter changes slightly depending on which side of the planet the storm happens to be on. 

Now you’ve probably heard of the Butterfly Effect, the general notion that even something as small as the beating of a butterfly’s wings could alter the course of a hurricane when given enough time for that effect to ripple and avalanche. If that is true, then it is pretty easy to demonstrate that the Universe, even in the absence of intelligence, cannot be predicted indefinitely far into the future. 

Which is to say, even if you could build a computer capable of handling all the calculations necessary to track every particle, and do so without altering the system, quantum events will boil up to the macroscopic scale and via the Butterfly Effect, alter everything, even the disposition of galaxies, given enough time. 

Adding intelligence and free will into the equation simultaneously eases and exacerbates the problem. As an intelligent agent, I can be quite unpredictable, but I can also force events to happen as I desire them to. If a stone rolls downhill following an unpredictable trajectory into a river causing it to change its course, I can walk over and remove it. I can also add some more stones to shift the river back on course. As we’ve discussed elsewhere on the channel, it is possible for us to move rivers, mountains, and even whole planets, solar systems, and entire galaxies. 

Now, regardless of whether or not one believes in the concept of free will, we know from an observational standpoint that individuals are often highly unpredictable in their specific actions, but perhaps a little less so in a statistical sense. 

You cannot usefully predict when a person will decide to stand up to go to the fridge and get a drink or what drink they will get... however, one might be able to proactively influence that decision. If I am talking to someone and mention being thirsty or make noises indicating that my throat is dry, they are very likely to ask if I would like a drink and also likely get one for themselves too. I could also influence which beverage they might select, if I ask for coffee they are more likely to get themselves a cup of coffee too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt I need to demonstrate to anyone today that human action is at the very least pretty hard to predict, under many circumstances, or that we can easily have our actions and decisions influenced. I probably also don’t need to convince you that as unpredictable as human actions might be individually, moment by moment, they do tend to average out a bit. I have no idea what I will have for lunch tomorrow, or what you will have, but we could look at restaurant sales and grocery store sales as a whole, and make some fairly accurate predictions as to how many people will eat cheeseburgers tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also generally speaking, the bigger our sample, the more accurate we will become. I might say you have a 10% chance of eating a cheeseburger tomorrow, but the level of uncertainty on that is quite large; if, on the other hand, I pick a small city of 100,000 people and estimate 10,000 of them will eat a cheeseburger, and 10,310 do, I will have been pretty accurate. In a nation of 100 million, where I predicted 10 million would eat a cheeseburger tomorrow, I might expect a deviation of as little as 3000, just 3 percent of a percent, which is pretty darn accurate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sample size expands, my accuracy increases, to the point that for things like the behavior of gas samples composed of trillions of trillions of individual and unpredictable molecules, I can predict some aspects of that sample’s behavior with incredible accuracy. I will actually be more accurate the bigger the sample, in direct contradiction to the notion that larger things containing more particles should be harder to predict than smaller ones. The complexity of a system for modeling it, as we see with planets in the solar system, does not correlate much with actual size. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many systems, as they scale up in complexity, can begin to exhibit emergent properties that make them easier to model too. In much the same way any collection of atoms can be modeled under quantum mechanics but is easier to model under Newtonian Mechanics, or chemical or biological or even psychological principles and laws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we can draw a few conclusions at this point. First, that while we may debate whether or not free will actually exists, and also whether or not we could predict someone’s behavior with a sufficiently large computer; from a practical standpoint individual behavior is not predictable with any degree of precision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that while individuals are unpredictable, they do generally tend to have many of the same motivations and actions and these actions can be externally influenced. If I offer someone a cheeseburger, they are more likely to eat a cheeseburger in the next few minutes than otherwise. 

Third, that although individual behavior is largely unpredictable, people in groups do behave somewhat more predictably, therefore we can apply statistics to large numbers of them and get useful results. The larger the sample, the more accurate those results will be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basis for Asimov’s Psychohistory. Here is the reasonably spoiler-free explanation: In the far future there exists a galaxy-wide empire that’s been around for thousands of years. It contains millions of planets populated by humans, and no intelligent aliens have been encountered anywhere in the galaxy in all of that time. For the most part technology and innovation have plateaued and come to a halt under the assumption that everything worth discovering has been discovered already. Indeed they are beginning to lose some technology. 

Entering upon this scene is a mathematician named Hari Seldon who invents a new science called Psychohistory that can predict the future course of human history. The success of this new science, its failures, and the efforts made to keep those predictions on track or to derail them, is what most of the series is about. I will avoid discussing that further in deference to your future reading enjoyment. However since Seldon’s first big prediction is revealed in the first short story and is also displayed on the dustjackets of many editions, I won’t feel guilty about exposing it… &nbsp;Seldon predicts that the Galactic Empire is going to fall, and indeed it does so with a lot of parallels to the old Roman Empire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sets up a Foundation for a new and better empire to build itself around in the aftermath of the Empire’s collapse. The Foundation is essentially a bunch of scholars sent off to a distant corner of the galaxy to build and maintain a huge Encyclopedia of all human knowledge, the Encyclopedia Galactica. Seldon can predict future events at the galactic scale with high accuracy, and can throw in a few things which if done just right and given enough time to build up momentum, will nudge the course of future events into a different and more desirable direction. He also gives us two axioms on which Psychohistory rests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that the population whose behavior was modeled should be sufficiently large; the smaller the sample, the less accurate the results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that the population should remain in ignorance of the results of the application of psychohistorical analyses. 

Which is to say, people can know Psychohistory exists and works, but they cannot be allowed to see a specific prediction or it’s very likely to change the outcome. 

As an example, if I told you it was predicted that you would be killed at work tomorrow, you’d probably call in sick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in the series we are given a third underlying axiom of Psychohistory, one considered too obvious for explicit mention, which is that Human Beings are the only sentient intelligence in the Galaxy, and from events in the book we can conclude that any intelligence, even a human, that deviates enough from normal human behavior can cause disruptions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth implied axiom is mentioned, but is steered away from since it is a bit of a plot hole. That is the notion of new technology altering the dynamics a lot. We talked at the end of last year about Black Swan Events, things which seriously disrupt society that are unpredictable in foresight but often seem obvious in hindsight. At the time I said that technology often tends to be a Black Swan. I’m sure Asimov agreed with this view, since he does bring it up, but dwelling on it massacres the basic concept of psychohistory. You can’t predict the impact of any new technology before it’s been invented since if you knew its characteristics well enough to predict them that accurately, in terms of their effect on civilization, you would probably know how to make the device already. As Richard Feynman once said, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” That’s a serious problem in the story, since the Foundation is constantly inventing new technology in the series. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asimov also indicates that the further down the road you try to look, the hazier it is and the more likely things are to diverge, and may need to be nudged back on course. In the series, Seldon shows up occasionally as pre-recorded holograms to do just that, and takes some other steps to keep the plan on track, but I won’t go into too much detail here, as that would spoil the story. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that’s the basic concept, and it is a decently solid one. As discussed, we can’t predict individual behavior, but we can see trends in human behavior which are probably subject to much more accurate modeling and prediction than we can currently manage. 

So while the option to develop psychohistory might exist, we have to toss in some caveats on how well it might be expected to function. 

First, we have no particular reason to believe history and human events have any inertia to them that tends to put us back on course. Indeed, most examples of inevitability we have tend to revolve around technological advances; such as us discovering how to farm cereal crops, and kingdoms arising in floodplains as a result. 

Such things are Black Swans, obvious in hindsight but unpredictable in advance. So we have the Butterfly Effect to contend with. While minor perturbations to the system will often smooth out over time, they also can amplify over time to cause major course changes. So no predictive method should allow us to predict events arbitrarily far off in the future, and in the short term, technology is constantly improving and improving technology produces changes that you can’t predict in advance since you don’t understand that technology before you invent it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though to add a caveat to that caveat, the longer humanity is around, the more likely civilization will increase in size, giving the system more inertia that is harder to perturb, and the more likely we will slow down or cease our technological progress. 

We have a tendency to say there’s always something new to be discovered, but odds are this is not so and that major scientific and technological improvements will eventually slow down or halt altogether at some point in the future. The notion that the Universe and its mysteries are infinite and unending, while possibly true, is honestly more jingoism and mysticism than scientific. I doubt we have to worry about running out of new scientific discoveries any time soon, but we probably will eventually, and a society that has done so ought to be more predictable without new technology constantly altering the dynamics. 

So that is caveat one, any psychohistorical model is going to be less accurate the further ahead it tries to predict, especially in an environment where major black swans like new technology can occur. 

Caveat two is that since it will rely on human behavior, the introduction of inhuman behavior will tend to disrupt things. This could be aliens, artificial intelligence, or even transhumans like cyborgs or genetically modified people. Though such models could probably be expanded to handle them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also the introduction of a new group, like aliens, might not make the model need to be twice as big, to account for their behavior, but potentially exponentially larger to handle all the strange interactions between the two groups. However, the unspoken psychohistorical axiom about aliens disrupting the plan has to be taken with a grain of salt, since we can assume any civilization or species is going to have behaviors and trends which can be predicted, given sufficient information to tweak the model to their behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caveat three is that people will want to change the outcomes. This is why the second axiom in the story is that folks can be aware of the existence of psychohistory but not its predictions. In the story, nobody can reproduce the science afterwards. A more realistic perspective is that if someone created such a science tomorrow, by year’s end everyone would have access to the concept and be working to improve it, either to make better predictions or foresee bad outcomes and warn folks. 

If everyone has access to those models, their predictive power will be limited, since people can see undesired outcomes coming and try to avoid them. Though we can also say that being able to predict events and outcomes, and everyone having access to those predictions, can have some good results too. Accurate weather forecasting, which sometimes seems like an oxymoron, is generally beneficial. So is letting folks on both sides of an argument see that most pathways in a conflict will turn out bad and that the other side can see the paths that are good for you but bad for them too, and move to cut those options out. 

For good or ill, we would expect these predictions to not remain secret, which would tend to alter the likelihood of them occurring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand there are such things as self-fulfilling prophecies. If everyone thinks an outcome is inevitable, they may think resistance is futile. So if someone tells you that Country X has some massive plan that makes them the inevitable founders of a great new empire, you are probably going to avoid going against them as an enemy and they will generally enter into any conflict with a lot more confidence. This can help tremendously,&nbsp;provided they avoid overconfidence. 

It is also possible to thwart such predictions by using random means to make decisions, much as we did a couple weeks back with a Quantum Random Number Generator. So if enough folks don’t like such predictive methods being used, they do have a way to counteract them. 

I wanted to take some time to discuss Chaos Theory today, but I haven’t been able to think of any way to explain that in a clear and simplified way beyond the basics. Chaotic systems are ones that are very sensitive to initial conditions and behavior can change wildly based on minor shifts to those initial conditions. A ball rolling down a smooth incline is not particularly chaotic, starting it a little higher or lower on that slope won’t change the results too much, it will just be a little faster or slower at the bottom. A chaotic system on the other hand varies wildly in its behavior with even minor changes to those starting conditions. Chaotic systems are a lot more sensitive to minor perturbations, and thus we’d say they are way more sensitive to the Butterfly Effect. Now a chaotic system is not a random one, it just tends to look random on initial inspection, it’s actually called Deterministic Chaos but tends to just be shortened to Chaos Theory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coin flip or dice roll is not truly random, but the final results, heads or tails or one to six, are incredibly sensitive to the initial starting conditions. Chaotic systems don’t have to be very complicated either, nor are complex systems necessarily chaotic, a set of hundreds of gears working together is pretty predictable though not simple, whereas a double pendulum, a pendulum with a second pendulum hanging from the end, is quite simple but chaotic. 

What’s relevant here is not that human civilization is probably a chaotic system, or that such systems are easy to perturb and hence sensitive to the butterfly effect, but rather that when you poke a chaotic system, even a minor deviation in that poke can get wildly different results. Push a switch and one of three things happens, you either push it hard enough to trigger the switch, not hard enough and nothing happens, or you push it so hard that you smash the switch and break it. By and large there’s a specific range of force that will flip that switch, too low, no effect, too high, broken switch. This is not a chaotic system. You can’t turn your lights on with a feather or a sledgehammer, but minor variations in the force used have no major impact on the system or outcome. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, push a person or a group of people and minor variations in the force could have a huge impact on the outcome. Getting 100,000 people to take an action that will alter the future in a desired way might work, and maybe 95,000 is just good enough and 105,000 is actually better. But it might be that even a deviation of ten or twelve folks more or less than 100,000 will fail to produce the desired result. That could be an example of a chaotic system. Just a few more people and they overestimate their strength and pursue more aggressive policies that fail, a few less people and they try for more violent tactics that also fail, but go even a bit less than that and perhaps the preferred outcome does happen, because they spend a bit more effort on tweaking their message to attract new recruits and supporters. 

We all tend to know on an intuitive level that trying to convince someone or sway their opinion can be a very delicate process, there’s no single exact right phrasing and tone to get the job done, but rather a range of them. 

Any suggestion can fail if just a little misaimed, too subtle, or not subtle enough. You can even cause a negative backlash, reinforcing a behavior or attitude you meant to discourage. 

Hence we tend to calibrate and nudge as we go along. We also know that there can be a lot of unintended consequences; push someone to exhibit one behavior and you might encourage another or suppress one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it can affect other people. The obvious case would be encouraging someone to change their career. It can shift or disrupt the lives of their family or coworkers, but&nbsp;the affects can also transmit a long way further out. If you’ve ever played the game six degrees of separation, or sometimes Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, you can usually connect just about anyone to anyone else with six or less people in-between. I wouldn’t be surprised if at some point someone made a facebook app that could track the closest line between you and someone else by Mutual Friends. But that connection is one of those things Butterfly Effects and Unintended Consequences can radiate down. 

The key point today about a chaotic system, which humanity probably qualifies as, is that it is especially sensitive to minor perturbations as with the Butterfly Effect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A result of that is that each additional effect that is sensitive to minor perturbation is increasingly likely to derail predictions as time and perturbations accumulate. Putting it in the mathematical terms, let’s assume I have a thousand year-long plan that has a crucial moment or major decision about once a century that can destroy the plan if the wrong action is taken. 

Each decision is pretty likely to be the right one, we’ll say about 90% chance per decision to keep the math easy, we have to successfully throw the dice each time. Not bad odds the first time, 90%, but the second time is also 90% and there’s only a .9 times .9 chance, or 81% chance, to get through step two. The next step is .9 times .9 times .9, or .729, 72.9% likely to succeed, still not bad, but by step 10, or .9^10, &nbsp;34.9% likely to succeed. 

Almost 2 to 1 against. You can also have a range of successes or partial failure that will increase or decrease the odds of hitting the next goal. Sequential probabilities are not kind, especially when the previous one can alter the odds of achieving the next goal, like if just barely succeeding or missing step 1 changed the odds of succeeding on step 2 from 90% to 80%. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s the nature of chaotic systems though, the first part of the definition about them being very sensitive to initial conditions sometimes makes people overlook that unless the system is totally closed from additional or outside influences, that sensitivity issue is ongoing and vulnerable to every new poke or nudge you give it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we’ve discussed the difficulties of implementing a system like this but it is probably worth considering whether you should use such a system even if it does turn out to be possible. Would such ongoing manipulations of the future be ethical given that so many people can be so profoundly affected for good or ill? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think there is a definitive yes or no because it’s not particularly clear cut. It clearly offers us a lot of benefits and while it is a bit controlling, you aren’t coercing or brainwashing anyone into specific actions, at least not necessarily. If you need to make nudges and corrections, you might have to resort to some fairly direct methods to push people who are individually threatening to derail the plan but that’s a different moral dilemma and also kind of implies your method is not too accurate and reliable either. 

If you’ve got to go around coercing, assassinating, brainwashing, or tricking key people into the right course of action on a regular basis to keep the plan intact, it probably means the plan isn’t too sturdy and resilient. You have to wonder how solid the system is if you essentially have to continually tinker with it, akin to issuing patches for poorly written software. You also have the moral issue of knowing in advance of bad outcomes for some people and doing nothing to prevent it, or even taken actions to make it happen, but that is essentially the Trolley Problem expanded to the planetary or galactic scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But barring that, the occasional nudges on individuals if necessary, which is a different animal, it is hard to argue that it differs, ethically speaking, from normal efforts to sway or change human civilization except in its degree of effectiveness. As I mentioned when we were discussing things like weather control or gene-tailoring or cybernetics, people have been trying to do such things for a long time, and just because science and technology make those efforts effective doesn’t mean they are now less ethical than all the failed attempts of the past. Taking a potion the local alchemist or witch promised you would give you superhuman vitality and taking a scientifically engineered medicine that actually does confer those benefits differs only in that the former might be full of mercury and nightshade and kill you without giving you the desired result, but if you thought it was going to work and took it, then you have still made the same ethical decision. 

Our history is full of folks consulting oracles for glimpses into and advice about the future, very rarely does anyone stop the storyteller mid-tale and ask if it was ethical for the protagonist to get a glimpse of a bad future foretelling the fall of their civilization; especially if he then seeks to change that future for the better. We constantly seek to change our future circumstances after all, and regularly create customs or policies designed to encourage folks to behaviors we think will be for the better. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is the potential for some pretty cold-blooded actions being available with the possession of such predictive technology, especially if it were some self-selected group that was picking out which future was best for everyone else, and that is giving them the benefit of the doubt that their intentions are benevolent. There’s no guarantee their intent will have begun benevolent, or stayed that way over time, or that their intentions, even if honorable, will be correct. Even wise men make serious judgment errors and as they say: power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. And being able to predict the future is a lot of power.. 

However I suspect it’s not ever going to be a concern because while I do think we will see predictive math applied more and more accurately to human civilization as time goes on, I suspect that this will always tend to be either very vague and error prone or quite specific and narrow in time and topic, like predicting how folks would react to a given policy enacted this year. We already do a lot of that with focus groups, polls, and marketing anyway, so seeing such predictive modeling&nbsp;increase in accuracy and become more widespread in use seems quite likely. That said, we can almost certainly rule out anyone ever developing methods to exactly predict events or individual actions, especially very far ahead in time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So whether or not we will ever develop a means of forecasting human behavior on the civilization scale, it is a pretty fascinating concept with a lot of possible benefits and problems. You certainly don’t need psychohistory to have predicted that such a concept would be endlessly thought-provoking, and keep the series that introduced it on the top of every best sci-fi list 75 years after the first short story was published. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next week we return to the Upward Bound Series to look at Launch Loops, the first of three looks at Active Support structures and how they let us get around physical limitations on material strength.

Industrializing the Moon
---
  
2017-05-18  
https://youtu.be/bGcvv3683Os  

---

When discussing the options for colonizing the Moon, as a stepping stone to the solar system, we’ll see that it’s not just one small step for a man, but one giant industrial park for mankind. 

So today we will be looking at colonizing the Moon, not just small bases but real colonies, and to do that we have to discuss the reasons why we would do that. 

This is not our first trip to the Moon on this channel, and won’t be our last either. 

We’ve visited briefly a number of times and even did an entire episode on Moonbase Concepts. 

In spite of this there’s a lot of material left to cover and we won’t do anything like exhaust it today. 

Our focus today is on the industrialization of the moon, essentially the reason to colonize it with thousands or even millions of people. 

Not just visit, plant the flag, and head home. 

The Moon has a bit of a strange position in the discussion of space travel. 

It remains the only place mankind has ever visited in person, but it’s been nearly half a century since we have been there, and only a dozen folks have ever set foot on it. 

It’s a big place, with a surface area larger than any continent but Asia, so those dozen astronauts didn’t explore much of it. 

It’s hard to picture the moon, we tend to envision it as a gray desert pockmarked with craters, which is true enough, but people tend to forget that those craters range from the microscopic up to craters bigger than all but the very largest nations and deeper than the Marianas Trench. 

Craters big enough to swallow whole nations and deep enough hide Mount Everest in aren’t what we usually picture when contemplating the Moon. 

We also hear a lot about lava tubes on the moon, corridors cutting through the stone near the surface. 

These can range in size a lot, and the low gravity allows them to get quite monstrous in size, looking less like a tunnel a mole or worm burrowed, and more like something one of the sandworms from Dune made. 

There are thought to be lava tubes on the Moon as wide as 500 meters and many kilometers long. 

We’ve got dozens of craters big enough to house major metropolitan areas or even decent sized nations. 

Domed over they are big enough to be their own mostly closed ecosystems. 

You could build domes that big too, an upside of low gravity, and as we discussed in the Life Support episode, even if a panel got shattered, air would not leak out so fast that you couldn’t repair it even if you didn’t have some high-tech self-sealing method. 

That’s an important thing to remember though, all those handy craters we can dome over exist because something big landed there, and while ones that big are quite infrequent, the moon’s lack of an atmosphere means that small meteors aren’t burning up before hitting and pea-sized meteors will be hitting in your vicinity reasonably often, though not so much so as to be a normal cause of death anymore than lightning is. 

If you lack the ability to make sturdy or self-sealing domes, those underground lava tubes are a lot more appealing. 

Particularly since the Moon’s day-night phase is a month long, and that light isn’t filtered of harmful radiation by an atmosphere, so that you will tend to want artificial lighting anyway. 

You could get some interesting colonies in a lava tube, since they’d tend to stretch out thin and long, akin to how we tend to develop habitats along rivers or roads. 

The craters and geology of the Moon, while fascinating, haven't proved enough justification to send more manned missions back there yet, let alone enough to set up permanent bases, which is solidly inside our current technological abilities, if expensive. 

What we are interested in today is the step beyond that, not purely scientific and exploratory missions, nor prestige voyages to prove to people you can land astronauts there and bring them home. 

That’s why the Moon holds that strange position in space travel, because it needs to be the place where we settle two questions. 

First, whether or not space exploration will be done only by robots, or if we will once again stick boots on the ground of an alien and inhospitable world. 

Second, whether or not we will ever do more than explore, but genuinely get out there and settle these places. 

We’ve already talked about how one can terraform planets or even the moon, and certainly how to make comfortable habitats on such places or orbital habitats floating in space by themselves. 

We know also the ultimate goal is to spread ourselves outward to other stars and to take dead and barren alien planets and make them homes for people, our pets and parasites, and all the other eggs we keep in this one fragile pale blue dot of a basket. 

But there’s a middle ground folks don’t spend much time on, which is what draws millions of people to the moon to live there and work there. 

It’s a bit like the underpants gnomes from South Park. 

They’ve got a business plan, Phase 1, collects underpants, Phase 3, profit. 

Almost everybody wants to go to the Moon, almost everybody wants us to set up bases and colonize the place, almost everybody wants us to send out ships to explore and settle the stars. 

But we’ve essentially got the gnomish dilemma, we know what phase 1 is, get people back on the Moon again and set up a base, and we know what Phase 3 is, a profitable and growing colony on the Moon, Phase 2 is a bit of question mark. 

This has gotten to the point that some folks want to cut the Moon out of the loop entirely and go straight to Mars, or the Asteroids, or even Venus. 

I’m all for doing all three and more, but I believe that the Moon holds the potential to be the best foothold to truly getting into space. 

And I think that means it needs to benefit us in a very real and tangible way. 

To demonstrate that though we have to begin by asking what benefits the Moon has. 

What has the Moon got that Earth lacks? 

What is on the Moon that the rest of the solar system lacks? 

To answer this we have to get a bit geocentric, because the first thing the Moon has that the rest of solar system lacks is its proximity to Earth. 

The moon is just over a light second away, meaning we can talk to people there real time. 

There’s a pause of 2.6 seconds for a message to get there and back, but that amounts to an annoying real-time lag, nothing more. 

Every other object is at least light minutes away, and constantly varies in distance. 

Venus is closest after that and can be as close as 38 million kilometers, or 2 light minutes away, to 261 million kilometers, 15 light minutes away. 

Mars is even further off and those two, along with Mercury, are our nearest neighbors. 

A ship with a power plant strong enough to provide one-gee of acceleration constantly, so that you could walk around over the engines like you were in normal Earth gravity, could reach the Moon in less than four hours, shorter than many routine flights on Earth. 

Such a flight is very energy wasteful and would involve flipping over halfway through to slow down, usually called ‘Turnover’, and reaching a speed of 63 kilometers per second. 

That’s fast but not truly huge compared to modern spacecraft, and something within the realm of possibility for the fission-powered or metallic hydrogen-fueled ships we’ve discussed in the Upward Bound series. 

That same speed would make a trip to Mars take more like 40 days, not 4 hours, and even a power plant able to provide a constant 1-gee burn would take about a week, and would need to be fusion powered. 

What else does the Moon have that the Solar System lacks? 

Well it lacks a significant atmosphere, but so does every other body in the solar system except the four Gas Giants, Earth, Venus, and Saturn’s moon, Titan. 

Of course, obviously excluding Earth, none of those atmospheres are breathable so they offer little benefit, the lack of one is quite handy for getting away from those places. 

Not so handy for landing on them though, since you can't aerobrake and have to burn fuel to slow down. 

However this is the same with virtually every one of the millions of large objects in the solar system. 

It also lacks much of a gravity well, making shipping stuff out a lot easier. 

In fact it is so easy, especially with a lot of the methods we discussed and will discuss in the Upward Bound series, that it actually easier to ship material from the Moon to Earth’s Low Orbit, a distance of 400,000 kilometers, than from Earth’s surface to our low orbit, a distance of less than a thousandth of that. 

Truth be told one can ship mass in from various asteroids without spending much more fuel, but only if you don’t mind waiting years for your shipments to arrive. 

The Apollo missions used the lower energy approach, so they took a lot more than the 4 hours a continuous 1-gee burn would take, and still they only needed 3 days. 

That’s comparable to a lot of normal freight times here on Earth, faster than low-priority bulk freight in fact. 

Shipping in from other planets or asteroids in the Belt could take many months or even years, especially if you’re conserving fuel. 

Now folks often discuss the riches to be found in asteroids, we even did an episode on it, hypothetical dragon hoards of gold or platinum. 

The Moon on the other hand has a composition pretty similar to Earth’s crust, that’s much of the reason we think the Moon was made when some smaller planet slammed into the Earth during the early days of the solar system. 

That means it is quite rich in materials we like to build out of. 

Plenty of Silicon and Oxygen, plenty of Aluminum and Iron, and surprisingly rich in Titanium. 

Indeed there are good odds a lot of those craters, especially the polar ones, have ice in them, and water is quite precious in the inner solar system outside of Earth. 

Yet it’s worth remembering that ice isn’t the only thing at the bottom of those craters, they were after all made from the impacts of the same meteors and asteroids folks are talking about mining. 

The Moon also has its dark side, which of course is not always dark. 

It gets as much light as the other side, but what it is dark to, and doesn’t get light from, is the Earth, making it a handy place for observatories, blocked from our glare and radio noise. 

The Moon is also a good place to do dangerous or controversial biological experiments, far from life and surrounded by lifeless inhospitable places. 

Ditto possibly dangerous nanotechnology experiments. 

We discussed setting up habitats for living space in the craters and lava tubes a few minutes ago, but it is also a great place for experiments with terraforming techniques for small, low-gravity places, which is most of them. 

We talk a lot about terraforming Mars or Venus, but there are thousands of small rocky bodies in our solar system we would want to mine and make livable, and they will be far away from Earth. 

The Moon is close enough we can fly in emergency supplies in enough time for it to matter, or supplies for projects we can’t make on the spot, in-situ, all those asteroids and moons around other planets are not close enough, even if you are pulling constant acceleration. 

So the Moon gives us a place to experiment with those techniques before we head out into deep space, where resupply can take months or years, and even advice from the experts can take hours to arrive by radio. 

And if you do plan to have spaceships that can carry out near perpetual 1-gee thrust around the solar system, it helps to have access to fuel. 

Hydrogen isn’t terribly common in the inner solar system away from large gravity wells, so the ice on the moon offers one supply, but it also has helium-3, which while harder to fuse than deuterium and tritium isotopes of hydrogen, isn’t too much harder and also offers us aneutronic fusion, or fusion that produces very few neutrons, which is good, particularly for spaceships, since it lets you get away with smaller engines that need less shielding. 

But even without fusion power plants or ones using Helium-3, the Moon is a great source of fuel. 

It’s got hydrogen, which is always a good propellant even without fusion, and it has also got plenty of phosphorus, sulfur, aluminum, and magnesium, which all burn well with oxygen, which is even more plentiful there. 

In addition, the Moon has a lot of KREEP, which is short for Potassium, K, Rare Earth Elements, and Phosphorus, and tends to be heavy in Uranium and Thorium. 

I also can’t stress enough the advantages of low-gravity manufacturing. 

Zero-gee has its own advantages, but the nice thing about low gravity is that stuff still works like we are used to. 

In a big smelter, denser materials still sink to the bottom of the vat, for instance. 

All sorts of very expensive manufacturing equipment that has to be built very sturdy here on Earth can be done a lot lighter and cheaper too. 

When you’re building there you have no wind or snow getting in the way and requiring sturdier buildings either, so you can build huge on the moon quite cheaply, and while actual space-based construction can be very handy too, you can build giant spaceships or even space stations on the Moon and tow them into orbit fairly easily. 

Here we start to see the basis for a lunar economy. 

Yes, tourism and science would provide a nice subsidy. 

Yes, it probably has its own stockpiles of precious metals in those craters. 

But the wealth there is all those things which we actually have here on Earth, but which are far easier to move from the surface of the Moon to anywhere near Earth than up from Earth itself. 

Raw mass for construction, and fuel, are what the Moon offers to run its economy. 

In a way, it’s like a giant orbiting warehouse, already conveniently pre-positioned to fuel our expansion out from Earth. 

Still a bit of a Catch-22 though. 

To make the moon profitable that way, you have to be expanding out into space. 

One has to ask what space has to make it profitable? 

Yes the moon, if industrialized, gives us all the materials we need to expand into the solar system, yes it gives us lots of practice living in space on airless rocks, but how are we to get to Phase 3, profit, when that relies on supplying all the materials for space expansion, we do need profit elsewhere in the solar system to drive that on the moon. 

That though, we can gloss over for today, because I still want to discuss Phase 4, what comes after that solar expansion, and how it can profit us closer to home. 

The Moon often gets treated as the gateway to space, but tends to get ignored afterward. 

When we’re discussing terraforming other planets in our system and elsewhere, the Moon is always some place vaguely referenced as having a colony on it, it becomes a footnote, historically important but no longer useful. 

We’ve talked a lot about how to get folks and material off Earth cheaper, so we didn’t need to import stuff from the Moon to orbit, but almost all those same tricks work on the Moon just as well or better. 

It’s very easy to build a mass driver or skyhook or even space elevator on the moon. 

A rotating skyhook, a rotovator, could spin right down from orbit and snatch cargo right off the ground and toss it into orbit, even right back to Earth. 

Because the Moon rotates on its axis far slower than Earth, once a month not once a day, space elevators there need to be longer, but don’t require any super-materials to build, we could manufacture one today. 

The low gravity and lack of wind make tall structures quite easy to build, that same low gravity makes excavating and mining much easier too, but you don’t need a supertall building for a mass driver because there is no atmosphere to rise above. 

Indeed with no oceans to cross, and no existing structures or borders, one can wrap a mass driver all the way around the Moon. 

You don’t need a vacuum tunnel around it either. 

This makes it far cheaper, just a railroad essentially, letting you build up some very impressive speeds before letting go of the track and flying off into space. 

All of which let’s you ship material back to Earth much cheaper than up from Earth. 

Now why do I keep emphasizing back to Earth? 

Isn’t the point to use the Moon to get things away from Earth? 

Well, yes and no. 

We often give a motivation for space travel being to find new places to put people, so we can support more of them without either a loss in standard of living or further depleting our ecosystem. 

I generally consider any scenario that allows you to support more people without hurting the planet or reducing the standard of living for those people to be by definition a good thing and tend to find folks who think otherwise a bit puzzling, which is putting it politely, and we’ve talked a lot about ways to support more people on Earth in the Arcologies and Ecumenopolises episodes. 

I mentioned at the time that there was a point between those and full blown Kardashev-2 Dyson Swarms, that I generally call a Planet Cloud or the Terran Cloud for lack of a better term. 

In this you are constructing rotating habitats around Earth to make more space for people to live. 

These differ from a Dyson Swarm in that they’re smaller overall in terms of living space but also far smaller and denser too. 

Rotating habitats are something we’ve discussed a lot on this channel, they benefit from being able to be tailored to any climate and day length and gravity you want, unlike other planets where it requires huge efforts to, for instance, shorten the day or increase the gravity, and they also require way, way less material per square kilometer of living area than a planet does. 

Just as an example, if we disassembled the Moon into a bunch of 100 meter wide sheets to form cylinder habitats, the Moon would give us about 220 billion square kilometers of those sheets, about 500 times the total surface area of Earth and a few thousand times what we have in terms of reasonably habitable land area. 

That would be about a quarter of a billion classic O’Neill Cylinder Habitats incidentally, but there is actually more than enough room for that many in Earth’s vicinity, places within a few light seconds where real time communication is possible and where those would still be spaced out enough to not bump into each other or block light from each other or Earth below. 

Sounds like an ambitious task, especially if you’ve joined the channel only since the Upward Bound Series began, which is about half the audience, but since we routinely discuss disassembling stars for fuel or moving them and whole solar systems, or even whole galaxies, the construction of a Planet Cloud is probably about a 3 out of 10 on the logarithmic scale of hard tasks we discuss here, with a ten being to collapse all the galaxies within about billion light years of here into one gravitational bound region that won’t be ripped apart by the Expanding Universe, and doing that only with known physics and no faster-than-light travel. 

We like to think big on this channel. 

In that respect, constructing a bunch of up-sized soda cans in orbit for folks to live on is not terribly difficult. 

Particularly since you can build them one at a time, as needed, to house folks who want to have more living space while staying near Earth. 

They do require a lot of mass though, even just one fairly small version of them, would require far more material than everything we’ve ever launched into orbit combined. 

Even with the systems we’ve discussed for getting folks off Earth cheaper, none of them are really suited to moving that much mass let alone cheaply. 

Not from Earth anyway, not even the Orbital Ring which we still haven’t covered in the Upward Bound Series, but is basically the grand-daddy of cheap transport of huge quantities of material into space. 

So there’s your profit source to fuel colonizing and industrializing the Moon for purposes beyond far-distant space colonies and various scientific efforts. 

You are using the Moon to mine and manufacture all that infrastructure and living space around Earth so you can house tens or hundreds of trillions of people in relative comfort and proximity to Earth, without needing to turn Earth into some concrete-covered megacity, and you can do it in stages, one station at a time. 

With better automation and different work environments, it’s hard to put anything approaching a solid figure out for the kind of workforce needed to build an O’Neill Cylinder, but I’ve calculated it a few different ways off current market costs for materials like steel, aluminum, and titanium, and the ballpark figure is about a million folks working for a year to provide the construction material for one of them. 

We’ll assume a lot more automation involved so that all the support industries and services needed on the Moon to build one per year would be a million people including their kids and other dependents. 

If you wanted to produce a Planet Cloud in less than geological times you’d need to be working on many of them at the same time, maybe taking a decade each to assemble the structure and have thousands at a time you were working on once things ramped up to full production, but under these kinds of values we can easily have multi-million if not multi-billion person populations on the Moon. 

Indeed I could easily envision a trillion-person Ecumenopolis Earth commissioning about a thousand a year to house about a billion new people a year total, or more, and needing a roughly comparable workforce of about a billion to build the things. 

Scale always gets a bit disorienting when we start talking about even Kardashev 1 civilizations, let alone 2’s or 3’s, what we’ve discussed here would be at least a couple centuries down the road. 

Early on those colonies on the Moon might be thousand-person installations where they are working on a way more modest space station to house a few thousand folks commissioned by, say, Brazil, to support their asteroid mining fleet which is mostly delving for gold and platinum. 

Everything is done incrementally. 

We bring up this massive case of a multi-billion population on the Moon to show that there is a potential large and long term industry there not just for getting folks out to other planets and stars but directly tied to Earth’s own normal economy. 

We see that industrializing the Moon can go a lot further than a few bases helping supply fuel and raw material for principally scientific endeavors in the next century or two. 

Of course to get all those colonists to the moon, or to all those orbital habitats, we need much cheaper ways of getting folks into space which can also be upscaled to allow transports of thousands if not millions of people a day. 

We’ll discuss one such system, launch loops, this month. 

After that we will be discussing predicting the future, and the idea of Psychohistory from Isaac Asimov’s classic Foundation series.

Infinite Improbability Issues

Space is big. 

Really big. 

You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. 

But as big is the Universe is, that’s just peanuts compared to the Multiverse. 

So today we will be looking at some of the stranger implications of the notion of the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and when it comes to strange, mind-bending, or ludicrous perspectives on reality, not many people could beat Douglas Adams, the late great author of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. 

This is not an episode about him or that series, but it is dedicated to him and indeed he’s probably the person most directly responsible for my own perspective on this subject, and since this episode was set to come out on the anniversary of his untimely death, it seemed fitting to give him a tribute. 

I’m going to take for a given that most of my audience is already quite familiar with his work, and if not, I cannot suggest strongly enough that you become so. 

I’d recommend beginning with the original BBC radio production of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which he later adapted into the book series. 

Those of you already familiar with that show doubtless recognized our intro music today, the Eagles’ “Journey of the Sorcerer”, which served as the intro and outro music for that show. 

It also happens to be my own first exposure to audiobooks and fiction. 

I read tons as a kid but it was all non-fiction to that point, and that radio show, along with the books adaptations he narrated himself, are what got me reading fiction, since there weren’t many audiobooks at the time so you often could find only one or two audiobooks by an author and had to read their other novels. 

I didn’t know it at the time but I’d already been exposed heavily to him from his time as a writer on Doctor Who, during the Fourth Doctor era. 

Having been principally raised by my mother and my grandfather, who were both big scifi fans, reruns of Doctor Who on PBS were a normal staple of my childhood and indeed my mother knitted me a replica of the ridiculously long scarf that character was known for, and I always consider Tom Baker the Doctor the others are measured against. 

I suspect Adams rather enjoyed alternate realities and time travel as story options since they give you a virtually unlimited supply of strange new places to visit, and he certainly took his audience to visit many of those worlds before he left us. 

We might as well begin our topic with explaining how this Many Worlds Interpretation arose and what it means, and we are going to see that it has a lot more strange implications than we usually see when its discussed in fiction, some of which are arguably rather dreadful. 

Of course to do this we have to discuss Quantum Mechanics a bit. 

Don’t Panic though, while the various interpretations of Quantum can be quite mind-boggling, they don’t require much technical knowledge. 

At the beginning of the twentieth century physicists were of the opinion we lived in a totally mechanistic universe. 

The notion at the time was the Universe worked on strictly mechanistic cause and effect lines, so with enough computers one could calculate the future exactly. 

It was deemed impossible to perform such calculations, and even with modern computers it would not be, but from a philosophical standpoint it didn’t matter if we could do it or not, just that everything was predetermined. 

Then along comes Quantum, which gives us apparently random events, throwing that right out the window. 

There are a ton of Interpretations of why these events are random or random-seeming, but the two big ones are the Copenhagen Interpretation and Many Worlds Interpretation. 

Copenhagen holds that there is just the one reality, or at least only one pertinent to quantum events, and that everything in it is in a constant state of fluctuation when not being observed. 

Simply put if you flip a coin, it is heads and tails until you observe it being one or the other. 

Now most of this random chaos is going on deep down at the atomic scale and tends to average out, so that most macroscopic events are still essentially determined in advance, but they still can bubble up to effect events bigger than the atomic. 

That actual coin might be 99.999% likely to be heads, but there’s still a finite chance it is tails until observed, and indeed a small but non-zero chance it will have turned into a Jelly Baby. 

If any given atom has a chance to decay, transmute, or move in a random fashion, it stands to reason there is an even smaller chance that two of them should do so at about the same time and place. 

Thus it stands to reason a few metal atoms might turn themselves into some sugar molecules. 

There’s an even smaller chance hundreds might do this, or trillions. 

The odds of this occurring are so small they would be preceded by a decimal point followed by enough zeros to fill a book, but they are still not zero. 

Now Many Worlds, and most Quantum Interpretations, hold to the same assumption, that these freakish improbabilities and random events can occur. 

Many Worlds however posits that there are many different worlds, one for each scenario to have played out. 

People over-simplify this though in terms of scale, they think “There’s a world where I skipped lunch today and one where I did not, one where I became president or did not”, that sort of thing. 

This is not sufficient, and does not fully cover the options. 

These types of alternate realities always terribly ignore the Butterfly Effect, which has nothing to do with quantum beyond ensuring that any quantum event that percolates up to the macroscopic scale will alter future history. 

We’ll discuss the Butterfly Effect more when we get to Isaac Asimov’s notion of Psychohistory this summer though. 

The basic result of the Butterfly Effect though is that even minor events like some guy you never met deciding not to get a haircut on Tuesday instead of Friday can avalanche to affect your life, especially if he did it a century or two ago, as time magnifies the effect. 

Many folks tend to think this quantum randomness really does not percolate to the day-to-day macroscopic level, we shall now demonstrate that it does. 

At the moment, based on channel size, the number of folks who will be watching this episode on the day it comes out should be twenty thousand or so and a good portion of you will be thinking about your next meal, while some are eating it now. 

For the former, you probably have not yet selected what to eat and may be prone to suggestions. 

I wrote down six, and used Australia National University’s online quantum number generator, and it selected a number, one to six, corresponding to cheeseburgers from those options. 

Out of a sample of thousands, we can almost guarantee a decent number of you will now decide to have a cheeseburger. 

This quantum cheeseburger you or someone else now eats is definitely a macroscopic event. 

This quantum cheeseburger will impact the rest of your life and human history. 

One of you will go to the pub to acquire this quantum cheeseburger and a pint of beer and in doing so will meet the gal or guy of your dreams and having a kid as a result. 

The quantum cheeseburger will have fundamentally altered your destiny. 

That randomly selected food option, produced by quantum chance, has now changed the fate of the Universe. 

And this is what quantum tell us, and to the best of our knowledge, no computer, not even a solar system spanning Matrioshka Brain, could have predicted the emergence of the Quantum Cheeseburger nor its subsequent impact on humanity. 

Indeed, as my audience is strongly composed of technophiles, many of you shall further mess with the notion of determinism at the macroscopic scale by visiting such a quantum random number generator and making a decision based on its outcome. 

Under the butterfly effect each of these decisions will ripple outward and impact everything, amplifying their effect as time goes on. 

Now of course that’s how it plays out in the Copenhagen Interpretation. 

In Many Worlds, the Quantum Cheeseburger exists in one reality, and the other five options each have their own, the Quantum Bratwurst, the Quantum Salad, the Quantum Lasagna, the Quantum Clam Chowder, and even the Quantum Chimichanga now exist and are irrevocably dominating the future history of their alternate Universes. 

But down at the quantum scale these events occur endlessly, and one must invariably consider that should Many Worlds be true, then all possible states exist. 

This is like the Library of Babel. 

In this hypothetical library every sequence of letters was written down to fill a book, much as though an infinite numbers of monkeys were given typewriters and set to replicate the works of Shakespeare. 

Now if we gave a monkey a keyboard that just had individual keys, no shifts or mods, one for all the capital letters and punctuations, we’ll say 100 keys total, or ten-squared, we know that any given letter or symbol has a 1 in 100 chance of being pressed, and the same for the next digit, so that any two letter combination has a 1 in 100 times 100, or 1 in 10,000, chance of occurring. 

1 in a million for any given 3 symbol combination, one in a trillion for any 6 symbol combination. 

A 22-symbol combination would be 1 in 100^22, or 10^44, that would be 100 Tredecillion, a Tredecillion being 10^42. 

On a roll of paper wide enough to hold 22 characters a line, and say a centimeter per line, the full scroll of every 22-character combination would be some 10^42 meters long. 

10 million, billion times longer than the Observable Universe is wide. 

And if we assumed each line and the paper it was on weighed a gram, it would have a mass of 10^41 kilograms, about 2% of the mass of our entire galaxy. 

On that immense scroll containing every possible 22-symbol combination of those 100 characters, somewhere on that will be the phrase “I Can Has Cheezburger?” And that’s just 22 characters, just one more and it would take an entire galactic mass to make the paper to write them all down. 

You would only need 27 characters to need the entire mass of the Observable Universe turned into paper to hold all those combinations. 

Indeed you’d use all that mass just to have all the monkeys and typewriters needed to produce the 22-character code. 

Your typical book has somewhere around a million characters in it, and you’d need 10 to the 2 millionth power of these books to fill this variation of the Library of Babel, and such a thing would not fit into a library the size of this Universe, not even close, even if we could find the mass to make all those books and prevent it undergoing gravitational collapse. 

It still would not even if the ‘paper’ was one atom thick and inscribed at the atomic scale. 

But somewhere in that Library, among all the random nonsense, is the script for this episode and a copy of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. 

Indeed there would be endless trillions of them that were functionally identical, one typo here or there, a double space, a meaningless word change that didn’t impact the story. 

That’s with just a million characters. 

Now consider that while a book might be just a million or so characters, your body is composed of trillions of cells each composed of trillions of atoms. 

As indeed is the quantum cheeseburger. 

In a large enough universe, if every particle is arranged randomly, somewhere in that massive spread of material is an identical copy of you, down to every memory you have, along with many more that are functionally identical, and some will be holding cheeseburgers and even ones with bacon on them, which is always better. 

And since these alternate universes need to include every combination and position of particles that could possibly have occurred since the beginning of time we end up with a number so ridiculously huge that you need to put exponents on your exponents to write it down. 

Andrei Linde and Vitaly Vanchurin of Stanford put that value at somewhere around 10 to the 10 to the 77 power. 

That is a number so big that if each of them had their own unique identifier code, a harddrive just containing all those addresses only would massively exceed the size of the Universe. 

We would say that any scenario that is possible, no matter how improbable, has to be going on somewhere, but at this scale for all practical purposes the impossible will seem to occur. 

Not only is there a universe right now where you flicked on your light switch and a random chunk of furniture in your house turned into a bunch of gold ingots, totally coincidentally, but there’s one that when you flipped it off and on again, another piece of furniture did so too. 

And on and on, so that even when scientists came by and repeated the process a thousand times, it ‘worked’ each time. 

Totally coincidentally, in virtually every other universe it did not, but in one, indeed in a near countless number of them, it did work. 

So everyone in those universes thinks somehow this impossible light switch makes gold, even the most ardent skeptic. 

In Many Worlds, there will be ones where the physical laws will seem different, even if they are not. 

We have no idea if Many Worlds is the correct interpretation, indeed we tend to think it is probably impossible to prove or disprove any of the major interpretations, but of course it is a very popular one with science fiction authors. 

They like to have it so folks can travel between these Universes too. 

I used to use as an example the old 90’s TV show Sliders for this, but most of you will be more familiar with the Portal Gun from Rick &amp; Morty, which is honestly a much better show too. 

Now we have no idea how you would go about doing this and I personally think it is impossible, but at the same time totally possible, and the same for time travel. 

Let me give you an example. 

Some mad scientist with a doctorate in quantum physics creates a box he believes will take him to any time or reality. 

He doesn’t know it, but what it actually does is vaporize him, he knows about that part but thinks it just randomizes all his particles and his pattern is imposed on some random matter in a different time or Universe. 

This doctor gets in the machine and vaporizes himself, no transport actually happens. 

Yet at the same time, so to speak, at some time and place in the multiverse, random quantum chances assemble that box and out steps a clone of the doctor, or one close enough to make no difference, down to the memories. 

Indeed there would be one where those false memories include having done this hundreds of time with dozens of companions over the centuries. 

It doesn’t matter that this process is impossible, he thinks it works, and indeed it may be argued that it does. 

People argue all the time about continuity of consciousness when it some to scifi transporters that rip you apart and reassemble you elsewhere from other matter, or that if we took the exact image of you and beamed that information to a super-3D printer light years away where it reassembled you, or close enough to make no difference, that what arrived is indeed you. 

If you suddenly wake up on a distant Earth-like planet far away in space and time, but remembering this life, even if those memories are fake, just random quantum assembled data, is that still you? 

If that copy was further away in space than light could have reached, is that faster than light travel? 

To the people of Zaphod II in Universe 8675309, who have a warp drive that totally does not actually work but coincidentally their ships keep assembling from random matter at the expected destination and time, it’s going to be a hard sell to convince them it doesn’t work. 

On this channel we discuss the Fermi Paradox a lot, the question of where all the aliens are, and one of the thought streams we follow on that is the Dyson Dilemma, which essentially argues that the very presence of the night sky with visible stars in it, indicates very strongly that there are no other technological civilizations within a billion or so light years of us. 

I put that theory together formally a couple years back, having some time on my hands from a cold, and decided make a video out of it while doped up on Nyquil, thus spawning this channel, and yes that is pretty much how it happened. 

When I did, I set a number of conditions on the idea that had to be true for it to be right. 

I also stipulated how even a lot of violations would result in the same outcome, such as having access to a better power source than stars. 

One of those though was that folks might discover a way to travel to alternate realities that was easier than traveling to other stars, or even other planets. 

If Many Worlds is true and one could pick alternate Universes to travel too, then the Dyson Dilemma essentially breaks down. 

You don’t need to colonize other solar systems or build massive energy collectors or artificial habitats around your own sun to form a Dyson Swarm because you can just step off to a copy of your own planet where everything is about the same only an asteroid landed on the tribe of the first proto-humans, or a plague got them, or the hypothetical Adam and Eve who first evolved to what we would call sapience, never did so. 

Now weirdly that’s one of the conditions of the Dyson Dilemma folks least argue with me about. 

It’s the condition for constant expansion when you can comfortably do so that seems to rub folks the wrong way, but occasionally someone will argue that it isn’t a solid condition because since those realities are finite, the ones with a mostly identical Earth minus people, should fill up eventually and sooner than later since there should be other versions of Earth that also developed the technology to slide between Universes and will be competing to populate those same empty versions. 

This though is where things get a bit weird, or get weirder anyway, everything about quantum is a bit weird. 

First we have to decide if they are just transporting to another reality, their information imposed on some collections of atoms there, or if they are actually transferring mass and energy to that new Universe. 

If the latter, we’d not only have to keep in mind there should now be a huge additional number of possible forkings in that Universe since you just added a trillion, trillion new atoms to it by stepping in, but also that those realities can effect each other, and so the number of possible universes arguably leaps up in a ridiculously huge way, making running out of them arguably impossible. 

Alternatively we would consider the former, that you are just copying your state to another reality. 

This also makes it impossible to run out of new spaces. 

Whether or not such a machine to genuinely slide between these Universes could be built, if these places do exist people will think they can be built. 

Because there is going to be a version of reality where, much like our Doctor stepping out the box, both of which just came into existence, there should be a Universe with an unpopulated Earth where a copy of you has just spawned standing there with a bunch of fake random memories ending with having stepped into a reality-slider box. 

Let’s assume we have a machine that takes a pattern inside it and copies it onto some random atoms in another reality. 

To keep it simple we copy one iron cube exactly a million atoms high, wide, and tall to the exact peak of Mount Everest. 

Now there are endless trillions of realities, all different from ours, where someone did exactly that same transport to that same location, producing the exact same result, so only one reality is needed to satisfy all those Universes, that transported the iron box there. 

So you cannot run out of room if every possible configuration of reality exists, even if those are finite, because many of those realities will be taking an action that results in the identical outcome. 

That’s why it’s a condition breaker on the Dyson Dilemma, though not the Fermi Paradox, if all possible scenarios for the Universe exist then there is one where there’s intelligent aliens everywhere and one where we are the only ones. 

Now I don’t think such a thing is possible, indeed I’m not a big fan of Many Worlds, which has nothing to do with its scientific merit, I just don’t like what it implies. 

It comes back to the whole free will and determinism thing, I don’t like the idea that there are trillions of near identical versions of me each writing this script right now. 

I don’t like the idea of thinking of them as the same person or that only a specific and exact copy of me down to the subatomic particles is actually me, since my body is constantly taking in new particles and memories. 

Yet I am, by any sane definition, still the same person I was when I started writing this sentence, even though I’ve inhaled trillions of new oxygen molecules and exhaled trillions of carbon dioxide particles whose constituent atoms were part of me earlier today. 

Even though I now have memories I didn’t have ten seconds ago. 

Of course I said by ‘any sane definition’, and when I say that I don’t necessarily mean the non-sane ones are wrong. 

I don’t think it would be possible to remain sane if someone genuinely, down to the core of their being, did not believe they had free will and an identity. 

Thus I hang out in the philosophical camp known as Compatibilism, even if I tend to think Immanuel Kant probably had a point when he called that line of thinking ‘a wretched subterfuge’ But these are the kind of issues we are faced with when considering the issue of near infinite improbabilities, and even without Many Worlds it can still arise in an infinite Universe or one so large as to encompass all possible states which might exist in a given Observable Volume. 

People often misinterpret the Big Bang Theory to say that the whole Universe came from a point-like object, or a very small one, when it actually says the chunk we can see presumably did, that original proto-verse pre-expansion is thought to be a lot bigger than the bit we can see now and quite possibly infinite, so that the proto-Universe started infinite and our chunk is just a finite part of the infinite whole which expanded from a finite part of the original, also infinite whole. 

We have no idea about that right now either. 

We also have a name for the Doctor or other folks who sprung out of nowhere with fully formed bodies and minds, and that’s a Boltzmann Brain, a topic we will be looking at in detail this summer. 

It doesn’t require Quantum either, just particles randomly bouncing around forming a pattern that just happens to be a thinking life form, and extreme example of what presumably caused abiogenesis on this planet. 

But that’s going to finish us off for today, like most episodes in this series, you’re probably coming away with more questions than answers, and I’d encourage you to look around the comments section for discussions or come join us at the Facebook or Reddit Groups, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, to discuss those more. 

With the channel’s wild growth this last year, I can’t actually reply to most comments anymore but I still try to read them all and reply to as many as I can, fortunately there’s a lot of other clever folks hanging around the channel to talk to. 

The schedule of episodes for the near-future is a little undetermined, at least at the time I’m writing this. 

As you may be aware I’m teaming up again with my friend Fraser Cain of Universe Today for another episode collaboration, the topic being resource extraction and utilization in space, which is going to go all the way up to disassembling planets, and we’re keeping the date on that a bit fluid since it’s hard to work as a team with deadlines. 

That topic was picked from among suggestions by our various patrons on Patreon, actually quite a few folks suggested that one, and if you’d like to help support the channel, you can follow the link to our Patreon account in the episode description. 

For alerts when that episode and other ones come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel.

The Nuclear Option

2017-05-04  
https://youtu.be/3aBOhC1c6m8

Moving a spaceship fast is all about having as much energy as you can for as little mass as possible. 

And when it comes to dense power sources, not many things beat Plutonium. 

So today we return to the Upward Bound series to look at atomic rockets. 

We are going to explore the basic concept and talk about using it safely. 

Last time we talked about chemical rockets, and how we could measure their efficiency in terms of their exhaust velocity or specific impulse, the higher the better. 

Fundamentally those depend on the energy released when you burn them, that accelerates the newly formed chemicals to high velocities and we direct them the opposite direction we want our rocket to go. 

The energy stored inside particles that is released by fission reactions is generally around a million times greater. 

Tapping that energy to provide thrust is a lot trickier, but if you can do it safely, without adding too much weight, and in a fashion fast enough to provide thrust, you have one heck of engine. 

This is easier said than done, but let’s start by looking at the basic concept. 

I don’t want to spend too much time on fission because we could do whole episodes on that, and maybe should at some point too, but not today. 

The key thing is that lots of elements and their isotopes are not very stable and prone to decay. 

Some like Uranium-235 take hundreds of millions of years to do this on their own, but if we manage to get a neutron nearby and moving slow enough to be captured, we can cause a reaction. 

Instead of decaying the nucleus will split into Barium, Krypton, and 3 more Neutrons. 

If we can slow those down they can get absorbed by other U-235 atoms, causing them to split, or fission, and emitting more neutrons, continuing the chain of reactions and emitting a lot of energy. 

And it is a lot of energy, as mentioned, generally speaking the energy being released by a kilogram of fissionable material is about a million times greater than a kilogram of chemical fuel or what we can store in our densest batteries. 

Needless to say we would very much like a power source that dense, because there are only a few more alternatives that are better. 

We’ve actually talked about those three, fusion, antimatter, and black holes, on other occasions. 

They are in a similar range though, 10-1000 times better than fission in terms of energy density, but fission is still a million times better than chemical power, and unlike those three we have entirely functional fission reactors already. 

We also have entirely functional fission rockets engines. 

Unlike a lot of the systems we have discussed in this series, these aren’t just on paper. 

We’ve built and tested a few of these, even before we landed on the moon, we’ve just never used them. 

Now as you might guess, with the space program going on in the 1960’s and us already having nukes and fission power plants by then, some folks considered using it for rocketry and both the US and Soviet Union experimented with the concept. 

The big program for this for the US was Project Rover. 

The main focus of that was Nuclear Thermal Rockets, which is pretty simple as a concept. 

The name explains the concept, you are using nuclear power to heat up some propellant, usually liquid hydrogen. 

We turn that nuclear energy into thermal energy and let that superheated liquid hydrogen, now a vapor, go flying out the back. 

There’s nothing radioactive about what gets sprayed out, you’re just using the reactor to heat the hydrogen up. 

It does a lot better than chemical rockets, which tend to have specific impulses of a few hundred seconds, this atomic rocket hits about a thousand. 

Which is a huge difference but nothing like what you’d expect considering the energies involved. 

We are limited in this regard because all we are doing is heating up the hydrogen and we can only heat it so much without melting stuff. 

We call this specific design a solid-core Nuclear Thermal Rocket. 

Or Solid Core NTR. 

Now with an effective Specific Impulse of nearly a thousand, this design was quite capable of lifting objects to orbit better than chemical rockets, much better. 

Where your typical rocket is virtually all fuel, a solid core NTR can lift closer to an equal ratio of engine and payload mass into orbit. 

But we have that concern of the thing blowing up and throwing radioactive materials all over the place. 

This concern is not helped by us trying to run everything as hot as possible. 

Those kinds of temperatures put all sorts of stresses on the components, and even the fuel rods are going to be expanding and cracking from all that heat. 

But the biggest thing working against this engine early on was not the radiation issue though, it was the weight. 

Reactors and engines back in those days were quite heavy. 

They still are, but we’ve learned some tricks since. 

It doesn't matter how high something’s specific impulse is, to be useful it has to be able to achieve a better than 1:1 Thrust Ratio. 

As mentioned last episode, specific impulse is measured in time, but that’s not how long a rocket typically burns. 

In fact it has to burn in a shorter time than that or it won’t get off the ground. 

A fuel with 400 seconds of specific impulse could hold a rocket hovering off the ground in Earth gravity for about 400 seconds, less since not all that rocket is fuel. 

That’s when it has a 1:1 thrust ratio, exactly balancing gravity. 

Burn it faster and it will go up, burn it slower and it won’t get off the ground. 

That’s the problem with things like ion drives, they’ve got huge specific impulse, but they expend that over an even longer time. 

Not coincidentally most things melt at the kind of energies chemical reactions generate, since they’re chemical bonds. 

So it isn’t too surprising that a lot of the things that would let us heat a propellant up even hotter than burning rocket fuel also tend to require either very slow usage or construction from some super material that won’t melt under those energies. 

We have some clever solutions to help with this, like cooling the rocket nozzles with the fuel, but fundamentally it is the same sort energies binding materials together chemically as what we get from burning chemical fuels, and nuclear energies are on an order of million times larger. 

In a jet engine we create a cool layer of air around the walls of the burn chamber and most of fuel gets burnt in inside a smaller tube of air in the middle, this keeps those components from heating up as much. 

Unfortunately this does not help the solid-core which is producing all that heat in the Nuclear Thermal Rocket, so our limiting factor on temperature is the core melting. 

The speed of exhaust particles is strongly related to temperature, higher temperature, faster speeds of the particles, going with the square root of temperature in Kelvin. 

Quadruple that temperature, double the speed. 

But it also relates to the mass of those particles inversely, quadruple their mass, half their speed. 

If you take a sample of gas composed of various chemicals but the same temperature, and measure their speed, you will notice a big difference. 

The oxygen will be moving a bit slower than the nitrogen on average, as diatomic oxygen molecules are just a little heavier than diatomic nitrogen. 

Carbon dioxide weighs more than both, and will be slower. 

Helium, being monatomic and much less massive, moves much faster. 

Hydrogen is even faster, though since it is diatomic too, it isn’t too much faster than helium. 

Since diatomic oxygen weighs 16 times more than diatomic hydrogen, the hydrogen will be moving four times faster at the same temperature. 

Again that speed also goes with the square root of temperature, so at 4800 Kelvin, sixteen times higher than room temperature of about 300 Kelvin, that speed would be four times higher, meaning diatomic hydrogen is moving about 16 times faster at those temperatures than oxygen is in the air you’re breathing right now, 480 meters per second. 

Now that speed for diatomic hydrogen at 4800 kelvin is about 7700 meters per second, almost orbital velocity, and would be a specific impulse of 785. 

Lone hydrogen atoms are even better. 

They would be moving at about 11,000 meter per second, higher than orbital velocity and about Earth’s escape velocity. 

Of course just about every metal is melted by then. 

Tungsten, the previous record holder, melts at just 3700 Kelvin, and the Sun’s surface isn’t much higher at 5800 Kelvin. 

Though we do have a new material made of hafnium, nitrogen, and carbon with a melting point of more than 4400 K. Anyway, this is why we always talk about hydrogen offering the highest specific impulse or exhaust velocity, as long as your main method of imparting energy to your propellant is heat, you will always do best with the lowest mass particles you can find. 

To get around the issue of the core melting we have some variations on the basic Nuclear Thermal Rocket besides the Solid-Core. 

These include the liquid core NTR, the vapor-core NTR, or the gas-core NTR. 

I don’t want to go into the mechanics of these but they let us get the propellant hotter without melting everything. 

The gas core is probably the best of these options, potentially allowing between 1500-5000 seconds of specific impulse. 

In this configuration our uranium is in a gas form and isn’t touching the reactor walls around it. 

We keep that gas spinning around in a toroidal shape, a donut, and potentially even magnetically confined using a similar concept to what we contemplate for the Tokamak Fusion reactor design. 

But if it isn’t touch the reactor walls, how does the heat get to the propellant? 

In the open cycle version, which offers 3-5000 seconds of specific impulse, this uranium gas can get to about 55,000 Kelvin, 10 times hotter than the surface of the sun, and this is very awesome except that when we say ‘open-cycle’ it does mean that the exhaust includes uranium. 

This means the use of an open-cycle gas-reactor would probably qualify as a war crime. 

See a normal solid core rocket, if it blows up, would scatter fragments of Uranium 235 through the area but that’s not too huge a problem, relatively speaking. 

U-235 is an alpha emitter, making it pretty safe to handle. 

You could juggle chunks of it without fear of anything more than breaking your wrist, as the stuff is quite dense and hard. 

The alpha-particles can't penetrate your outer layer of dead skin. 

It’s only dangerous if you ingest or inhale it. 

Needless to say if we’re spitting out a plume of propellant that contains uranium gas among the main hydrogen propellant, this is going to result in folks inhaling it. 

So that makes it good for space-only applications, far from Earth, but not for on or near Earth. 

Now we have an alternative form of this called the closed-cycle gas core nuclear thermal rocket, which being a bit of mouthful is usually called a Nuclear Light Bulb. 

In the closed-cycle version of this we line the wall with quartz and that let the Ultraviolet light being produced by the very hot radioactive gas to pass through into our propellant. 

This gives it the nickname of the Nuclear Light Bulb. 

This achieves a higher specific impulse than the normal solid core, 1500-2000 seconds, but not as high as the open-cycle. 

Still, since it can achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of better than one-to-one, this design should be buildable to get into orbit. 

That more or less exhaust the on-planet uses, and with the concerns folks have with nuclear vehicles it isn’t too surprising none of these have ever flown, and the solid core NTR was the only one ever built and tested. 

They do work though, obviously we’d need some prototyping for anything but the solid-core design but the constraint here is all about safety concerns, not engineering difficulties. 

For instance, the Nuclear Light Bulb is quite safe unless it blows up on the way up, venting all that uranium gas into the air. 

Needless to say, while these things work and even the solid core NTR is vastly better than chemical rockets, nobody’s been pushing hard for more R&amp;D and deployment of them. 

But you could absolutely build a spaceplane that ran on these methods. 

People tend to be a lot more open to using them away from Earth though, and we also have some more designs that work better there. 

Any of the designs we discussed so far work off planet too, but they can work on-planet because they can achieve enough thrust to get off the ground. 

Which is to say, they can burn their fuel up faster than its specific impulse. 

Away from Earth this doesn’t matter. 

Gravity isn’t trying to drag you down. 

These things all have specific impulses measured in minutes, but up there it doesn’t matter if you need to spend a whole day burning through it, or even weeks, just so long as your burn time isn’t longer than your trip. 

This gives us our first option, which is just a nuclear reactor providing power to run an ion drive. 

We discussed these more in the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium, and it’s the same concept, you use a magnetic field to accelerate your propellant up to high speed. 

The reactor provides the electricity for this. 

So can a solar panel though, at least near the sun, though it takes a lot of them. 

So this isn’t really an atomic rocket any more than the computer I make these videos on is an atomic computer, just because there’s a nuclear power plant two towns over. 

Now I mentioned earlier that while we can cause fission reactions, typically by hitting the material with a neutron, those materials do decay on their own. 

Half-lives can range from less than a second to longer than the universe is old. 

For U-235 it is about 700 million years, which is why it makes up only a small portion of available uranium. 

Most of that is U-238, and we would normally say that a sample of uranium that we’d removed the shorter half-life isotopes from was depleted of them, while one where we removed a lot of the U-238 was enriched. 

Depleted Uranium is still pretty handy stuff, partially because it is so dense it makes great bullets and armor. 

It has a second use though, which is making plutonium. 

Add a neutron to U-238 and it transmutes into Plutonium-239, which has a much shorter half-life. 

Reactors designed for doing that are called breeder reactors, and we use the same idea for Thorium, adding to it and turning it into shorter half-life isotopes of uranium. 

As a very loose rule of thumb, stuff tends to give off about one-thousandth of its mass energy over the course of its half-life. 

So a handful of something like U-235 is going to only be giving off milliwatts of heat energy, though it does it for around a billion years, releasing a million times what an equal amount of gasoline would release on combustion. 

Pick some radioactive isotope with much shorter half-life, in the hundreds of years instead of hundreds of millions, and that same handful would give off kilowatts of power not milliwatts. 

Polunium-210 is the isotope I usually hear considered for this, it is an alpha-emitter and without any gamma, meaning it is easily shielded, and it decays directly to lead and has a half life of 138 days, meaning that a single kilogram of the stuff generates about 140 kilowatts of heat. 

It’s crazy-toxic though, a microgram ingested will kill you. 

This sort of rocket, a Radioisotope Rocket, works much the same as the other kinds, you let it heat up a propellant, but it has no moving parts itself. 

It’s just a big heater. 

We often use radioisotopes as a power source in space vehicles. 

A Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, or RTG, produces heat that we turn into electricity with thermocouples. 

Those are not terribly efficient, 3-7% heat energy to electricity conversion tends to be the norm, but they have zero moving parts so they are very durable. 

Also handy for keeping the object warm. 

We use RTGs in space vehicles fairly often, and you just pick a radioisotope that’s fairly cheap and has a half-life similar to intended mission duration. 

Or for a rocket, similar to how long it will be in transit or for which you want to run the engines. 

The big disadvantage of course being that you cannot throttle it. 

It produces a set amount of power, slowly ebbing off before reaching half-power at the half-life. 

You wouldn’t want to use one for trying to slow down after a long mission for instance since most of it would be gone when it came time to decelerate, whereas you can keep U-235 around a long while and just add it to the reactor like fuel when you need it, and you can throttle a fission reactor, though generally nowhere near as quickly as a combustion engine. 

Now a more efficient but slower accelerating version of this is the Fission Sail, where essentially you are directly harnessing the decay particles rather than their heat. 

When a particle decays it always conserves momentum doing so, meaning for a simple two product decay, one particles flies one direction and the other flies the other direction with the same momentum. 

It does so totally randomly, but if you stuck some on the back of a rocket ship behind some shielding, some would hit it, pushing it forward, and others fly backward. 

Since direction is random, generally this need to be a sail some kilometers wide, with basically two layers, one an absorber and one behind it being the isotope. 

This idea comes to us from physicist and scifi author Robert Forward, one of the folks I tend to consider a spiritual patron of the channel, and he suggested it as an add-on for a solar sail, in that since it is already so big we might as well let it reflect light and gain speed from that too. 

On a similar notion we also have the Nuclear Photonic Rocket, a slow accelerating but high final-speed ship that just uses the heat to push it along. 

Light has momentum, as we’ve discussed in other episodes, so if you can get your waste heat on a ship to radiate a-symmetrically you can get thrust. 

And of course this can be easily accomplished with either natural decay or standard fission by just having a sphere of the stuff getting hot, attached to the back of the ship inside a parabolic dish that is reflective to the frequencies of light being given off, infrared presumably. 

This is a very easy type of interstellar probe if you’re just using a sphere of some radioisotope wrapped in an absorber. 

It won’t get super-fast and it will take its sweet time doing it, but it can get to speeds that will get to another star in centuries, not millennia, and the design is so simple you could bang one out in your garage, assuming you don’t irradiate yourself to death. 

We do have a few other designs like the Fission Fragment Rocket and Robert Zubrin’s Nuclear Salt-Water Rocket, and these again are strictly for off-planet use too. 

But the big one I wanted to spend a little time on is Nuclear Pulse Propulsion. 

I discussed this once before way back in the Interstellar Colonization episode and mostly bypassed it in the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium as a result. 

This series is also mostly about getting off Earth, not to other solar systems, and this system is beyond useless for the former so it will still get only a short mention today. 

The reason it is useless for planetary launch is that the propulsion utilizes nukes. 

Conceptually this is pretty straightforward. 

You shoot a nuke out behind you and it detonates, shoving your ship forward. 

Sounds crazy but it’s not as bad as you’d think in deep space. 

You stick a very large plate behind you made of a sturdy substance and on a huge spring, it gets walloped by the blast and slams forward, contracting the spring and then returning backwards, in much the same way the blast from a bullet on the bolt of gun occurs, helping to distribute that sudden massive blast. 

When a nuke detonates in space there’s not much of a shockwave, the atomized components of the bomb, and a ton of gamma radiation. 

You build your pusher plate thick enough to handle the strikes and wide enough to catch most of the blast at whatever distance is the minimum safe distance behind the ship to detonate the nuke. 

These are big ships, multi-megaton ones bigger than an aircraft carrier. 

They can also use fusion bombs, not just fission bombs, letting you achieve even higher speeds with even bigger ships. 

This is the only interstellar ship design we have right now that could definitely take human passengers and deliver them to another solar system with no new technology. 

The Low-tech version of it also allowed you to get to Mars with quite a large ship in just 4 weeks, and it usually gets rated as a specific impulse of 6000 seconds or more, one of the variations, the Medusa, having an estimated 100,000 seconds, and 1% of light speed is a realistic option with them. 

Also a handy way to slow a ship down as it approaches its destination if you are using lasers to push it up to speed, a technique we’ve discussed before too in the Interstellar Highway episode. 

Of course no discussion of nuclear propulsion is complete without at least mentioning fusion, we might figure out how to do that tomorrow or ten minutes from doomsday, and it is something we have discussed at length elsewhere on the channel, especially in the Interstellar Travel Challenges episode. 

This has a lot of the same problems fission has though since you still have the problem of all that heat melting your equipment long before you maximize its use in speeding up your propellant. 

It’s also one of the reasons I prefer photons as a propellant, they’re already going quite fast. 

What’s more it is one of the reasons for while I regularly discuss fusion for interplanetary and interstellar craft, but I don’t discuss it for getting off planets much. 

No engine is useful for this purpose, no matter how powerful, if you can’t produce a thrust to weight ratio of better than one-to-one. 

Some massive 500-gigawatt 100,000 ton fusion reactor might make the space shuttle engines look weak but still be as useful for launching itself into space as the Hoover Dam is. 

Needs to be powerful and light, and compact too if it has to fight through an atmosphere. 

But for operations once in space, fusion would be amazing. 

We see a bit of an emerging picture though that the Nuclear Options aren’t great for on a planet. 

Now a few forms can be used there, and it just comes down to if the engineers can make a design safe enough that folks would approve its use. 

Off planet the biggest issue would be finding fissionable material to operate them, since the radiation and disposal concerns are minimal. 

That makes them potentially very handy for operations with asteroid mining, since atomic rockets are excellent for moving cargo at those kinds of speeds and distances and there’s no gravity wells for them to fight. 

However asteroids generally will not have concentrations of uranium or thorium ores, that’s more the product of geological processes on larger bodies, so Earth has plenty readily available to offer in trade to asteroid miners, and place like the Moon and Mars do too. 

Very little of the mass of nuclear thermal rockets is the fission fuel so shipping that out of the gravity well of those bodies is not a huge constraint. 

Normally at this stage of the episode I discuss Safety and Cost aspects but that seems kind of pointless here. 

There’s nothing very expensive about Nuclear Thermal Rockets though I’d imagine the R&amp;D to fully develop them safely could get pricy. 

They should be a deal cheaper than chemical rockets but estimating nuclear costs is always hard because of the safety &amp; regulatory aspects. 

Those safety and regulatory concerns are the same ones for normal nuclear power and it seems like a bad idea to discuss those here. 

If you are pro-nuclear power, you don’t need any convincing these can probably be done safely and that we wouldn’t launch them if they were not. 

If you are opposed to it, there’s nothing I can say to change your mind. 

Atomics is always a tricky one in that regard because it is genuinely dangerous stuff, so it’s hard for me to yell at people about being overly afraid and cautious about the stuff, but I also won’t pretend that I think fears of nuclear power are entirely reasonable either. 

Sadly I can’t say I expect those concerns to diminish in the near future, so in the end I can’t say that I expect atomic rockets to see much use in Earth or Low Orbit, and I suspect they’d only see a major role in space travel if we developed a fairly large off-planet mining and refining operation before we developed viable fusion. 

That why we so often see nuclear propulsion designs as strictly space-based vehicles, not aerodynamic constructs. 

They mostly aren’t expected to take off or land from planets, but rather move between them. 

Incidentally I wanted to thank animator and fellow youtuber Fragomatik for providing the some examples for today’s episode. 

He does a lot of amazing animations of many of the concepts we've discussed today as well as other spaceships and space habitats, and I've included a link to his channel in the video description. 

Make sure to give him a like and subscribe. 

In this series we’ve mostly looked at getting up into space. 

But once you get up in space, unless you just want to hang around in orbit, you need to go somewhere and nuclear propulsion offers us some of the best options for that with our current technology. 

Now even if it isn’t too suitable for launching ships directly to orbit, we will be looking at how nuclear power, fission or fusion, can help us get off the planet more as the series progresses. 

Indeed powering the mass drivers we discussed a couple episodes back would be one such example. 

Most of the systems we will be discussing after this require very large amounts of power to function, and so are ideal for ground-based power plants where there’s no fear of atomic fuel crashing into the ground or vaporizing over a huge swath of land to be inhaled. 

Indeed, since many of these launch systems would be far from human habitation, they’re a lot safer for employing atomic energy. 

We will examine one such system, Launch Loops, in the next episode of the series. 

However, next week it will back to Existential Crisis Series for Infinite Improbability Issues, and we are going to explore some of the stranger implications of concepts like the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and Alternate Universes.

Cyborgs

2017-04-27  
https://youtu.be/cGYKCTFIZLI  

---

One of the most important things to remember when considering whether or not it’s ethical for people to become cyborgs, is that that ship sailed a long time ago. 

Today we are looking at cyborgs, this subject having placed first out of a few dozen options on the most recent topic poll over at the Channel’s Facebook Group, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur. 

I, of course, am your host, the aforementioned Isaac Arthur. 

Cyborgs is an interesting topic, but also tricky one for me to cover because it falls into that range of technologies where I feel we’ve let popular fiction kind of let our imaginations run wild and not in the good way. 

It’s a topic that gets a bit controversial when it probably shouldn’t be, and we have a hard time defining what a cyborg is, in terms of what people think a cyborg is, in such a way that it would not already include most of us nowadays. 

When we explore the more proper definition we will see that it is even harder to argue that we aren’t cyborgs right now. 

So instead of starting by defining what a cyborg actually is, let’s ask ourselves what it is not. 

When I think cyborg I think of someone who looks like a regular human, but has some machinery inside them, probably mostly microscopic, that helps with some task. 

What a lot of folks picture is a guy with shiny metal arms, and sadly something a bit less than human, or sometimes just as troubling, as more than human. 

For that matter folks often confuse them with androids, which are robots that look human, and the line could get blurry between the two on some paths. 

Fundamentally a lot of terms like machine or robot or cyborg or android can get quite indistinct. 

This is something I always warn people about with definitions for hazy concepts that are still emerging, you need a definition that includes all the examples you think should be in there without including those which should not be. 

That is very hard with a cyborg because, for instance, tons of people already have machines inside them, such as pacemakers and cochlear implants. 

We wouldn’t normally call Jim a cyborg because he’s got a pacemaker in his chest. 

Similarly one hardly needs to make a machine out of metal, a plastic or ceramic machine would seem the same. 

Many of us do have fillings in our teeth or pins or plates in our bones or skull where we got injured, we are not cyborgs. 

Many folks have piercings or tattoos, they are not cyborgs either. 

We also can’t exclude things which are strictly medical as opposed to elective and cosmetic. 

A man does not become a cyborg because he elects to have his arm replaced with a robotic prosthetic rather than having lost his arm to an accident. 

Nor would the sophistication of the device seem a key factor in our definition. 

A person with an ancient wooden peg-leg would seem an absurd example of a cyborg, but it is hard to argue some fundamental transition has happened by using some prosthetic that is more sophisticated. 

So what is a cyborg? 

Our answer is in the actual definition of cyborg and of cybernetics, and how the term originated, because it is a bit surprising and alters the perspective on this concept. 

That new perspective is one I think far more useful to this topic too. 

Cyborg is simply short for Cybernetic Organism, but most folks do not know what cybernetics is or what it originally meant. 

Unsurprisingly, like a lot of science terms, it is Greek, and we see it used all the way back to Plato, who used it in the context of governing systems. 

We see the term evolve a bit as we get into 19th century, when folks like Ampere, from who we get the unit of electrical current, the amp, use it to discuss control and communication systems inside mechanisms. 

We had begun getting machines complicated enough to need lots of valves and so forth to help ‘govern’ the proper function of the device. 

Jump forward to the middle of the 20th century and we get the founder of the cybernetics discipline, mathematician Norbert Wiener, defining cybernetics as the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine. 

A cyberneticist might study a human to see the various feedback and control mechanisms our body uses to regulate itself. 

They might similarly study the weather and climate to see how that feeds back and regulates itself. 

Jumping forward another decade or so to the 1960s, and we see the term cyborg coined Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline, no relation, and was defined as follows: “A cyborg is essentially a man-machine system in which the control mechanisms of the human portion are modified externally by drugs or regulatory devices so that the being can live in some environment different than the normal one.” There’s some interesting language there, ‘modified externally’, ‘drugs or regulatory devices’, and the part about living in a different environment. 

They were talking about space explorers, and a cyborg would be a man in a spacesuit, for instance. 

Note, not the man, the man plus the spacesuit. 

That is the cybernetic system and it is an it. 

Now there’s a strong implication of something long-lasting or permanent, throwing on a winter coat to go out in the snow doesn’t make you a cyborg, that would give us too trivial of a definition, but it is not really ‘you’ anyway. 

The cybernetic system is getting called ‘it’ not to imply a lack of humanity but in the same way we would refer to a rowboat being powered by one or more people as an it. 

The traffic system of a large metropolis is a complex one, as is its sewer system, and both might be studied by cybernetics, that the one happens to have actual people inside it doesn’t mean we stop referring to it as it. 

But no dehumanization is intended. 

We begin to see what we are actually talking about is not replacements, but alterations from the natural state. 

Now natural is always a bit of an iffy term, especially when we talk about complex systems. 

Nature is constantly in flux and only achieves brief states of meta-stability. 

Natural and artificial are both terms that highlight the issue we have with definitions and are obviously relevant to discussing cyborgs, but our interest in the moment is how if an ecological system is destabilized by something, it will tend to settle into a new equilibrium. 

Some plant moves in and one critter eats it and grows in number while another does not and decreases in number, and the predators alter their numbers accordingly. 

Ten years later a family of beavers moves into the area because the predators that used to reside there are no longer as big a threat as they used to be. 

Beavers being beavers, they dam up a river and the whole local ecologies changes again, and so on. 

New equilibriums are reached. 

Individual organisms as complex as humans have their own complex ecologies inside them and they change too, but as a whole that variation is fairly tiny from our perspective. 

I don’t catch a flu and sprout a third arm or suddenly develop a dislike for coffee. 

A person who suffers hearing damage, lowering the range they can hear well, might pick up a bigger fondness for drums than higher-pitched horns. 

If we fix that, the situation may change. 

It doesn’t matter how, surgery, medication, transplants from someone else, cloned ear drums, mechanical ones, or whatever. 

But if we increased his range to include higher frequencies, we once again alter the state of the system. 

Again the method doesn’t actually matter, our person can now hear ultrasonic sounds, under our definition they are now a cyborg. 

The field of cybernetics is again focused on such complex and dynamic systems of control and communication. 

Now whether you know it or not there are ultrasonic sound going on around you quite regularly. 

Indeed there are sounds going on that most of us can’t hear anymore, but little children usually can, since our hearing decays with age and most strongly in those upper ranges. 

There’s actually a device called the Mosquito that generates irritating sounds in those lost ranges which some places use to deter young people from loitering. 

You can use the same on many animals to keep them away from an area. 

A person given ultrasonic hearing might find all sorts of environments unpleasant, and avoid them, they might find some music the rest of us enjoyed unbearable because the instrument emitted horrible squeaks we couldn’t normally hear. 

Now, that’s an easy fix, whatever you did to them to let them hear that can have an off switch included, but it is a simple example of what we mean by cyborgs and cybernetics. 

Your classic scifi or comic book cyborg with the metal arm that lets him hoist up cars with that hand is rarely shown having his arm rip of or his spine snap under the weight and forces. 

It’s a bit like superman, he can lift up a plane or train but for some reason the ground under his feet doesn’t collapse. 

I’d imagine at least some writer explained that but a handwave is a handwave even when dressed up to sound logical in the fictional science of scifi and comic books. 

If you want to be able to punch through a wall we need to reinforce your skin so it isn’t shredded. 

We need to make sure where it connects to the body has been reinforced so it does rip free under the forces on your arm from hitting that wall. 

If you want to be able to lift up heavy weights we have to modify almost every bone to handle the stress. 

I’ve seen a number of cartoons where someone whirls around like a tornado, but we know spinning around causes vertigo, and we also know doing that causes the blood to rush to your extremities. 

So if you wanted to be able to do that you’d need to also alter that person to handle both of those issues. 

Of course we also have to worry that a person who has been augmented in some fashion could have a personality change too. 

The ability to bench press a truck could alter someone’s behavior and not necessarily for the best. 

Now like many technologies that we discuss here, it is often the case that the ethical or moral issues that arise are not entirely new ones. 

If being a juiced up cyborg makes some folks arrogant and act untouchable and superior, so too do many other things. 

We often encourage folks to get into good shape for their health and include the mental side of things too, it often helps with confidence or depression, so it is change but a good one. 

Though I’ve known a fair few folks who got into shape and became a bit unbearable. 

So too, someone who has been poor their whole life and humble in demeanor might become quite the jerk if they suddenly got wealthy. 

I’ve known many a person who after getting an education became a bit of jerk about that too. 

We obviously don’t consider someone a cyborg for such things, but it’s fundamentally the same sort of issue. 

I am not going to ban going to the gym or starting a business or going to college for fear it might make some folks get a big head. 

Such being the case, I can’t see the reason or difference in banning someone getting themselves some cybernetic augmentations to be stronger or faster or smarter. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if some places did ban them of course, but many places would not. 

I remember last week I joked about a nice advantage of oceanic launches of rockets is that doing it in international waters let you get around most regulations. 

Talking with a friend afterwards I joked about how you could gamble at such spaceports too, and casinos might make a nice extra source of income for such a floating island. 

I could easily see cybernetic shops setting up there too. 

Now while it is amusing to imagine floating cities springing up offering all manner of services, likely many unsavory, that are banned or restricted elsewhere, the legalities of cyborgs don’t interest us too much today. 

What does interest us, now that we’ve gotten the concept down, what it is and is not, is what sort of augmentations we might see. 

I’m going to mostly bypass the idea of being stronger, faster, or smarter, we already talked about faster reflexes and thinking in the Transhumanism and Superintelligence episodes. 

And the image of the super-strong cyborg who can flip cars, have bullets bounce off them, and has a laser gun in the arm is honestly kinda boring to discuss. 

We already know that concept and I’d have little to add. 

Flashy concept but straightforward, and not actually that handy on a day to day basis. 

I’ve divided the various types of augmentations into some general categories and we’ll discuss the options for each. 

Those are Medical Applications, Augmented Reality, Sensory Augmentation, Physical Augmentation, and Mental Augmentation. 

Now in many of these cases it isn’t necessary to actually implant anything at all, and it doesn’t make much difference to us today. 

Beginning with medical applications, it is worth noting that again cybernetics is about communication and control of a system, and we see that strongly in this subject. 

The first and most obvious medical application that could be viewed as augmentation is something that let’s you keep track of your health. 

We already have this emerging, watches that kept track of your heart rate too have been available for a long while, but the FitBit and its competitors are starting to get quite common. 

I wear such a device on my wrist and I’d imagine many of you do too. 

What’s actually handy about such things is that the data can be sent to your smartphone, with its greater capacity for running applications, and you can look at it and see other things like how you are sleeping. 

As a diagnostic tool for doctors this is fairly handy, and as such monitors improve its medical value will improve too. 

Such monitors might come to monitor almost everything, we might figure out how to do detailed analysis of our blood without poking a hole in ourselves to get a sample, but implant or something you wear, it is very easy to imagine us all having monitors constantly keeping track of everything going on inside of us and also what we put inside us. 

You don’t need to input manually what you ate because various detectors in or on you run analysis on what you are eating and say that cheeseburger has this many calories. 

Or perhaps you’ve got a little sensor in your stomach that’s keeping track of nutrients and toxins coming in. 

Others are tracking your white cell count, or if you are deficient in iron or Vitamin C, or if you are dehydrated. 

Long before you get a headache or noticeable symptoms of a cold it’s detecting the signs. 

With that information you can take action before it gets bad and requires more effort. 

With all that data available it can say take an aspirin or ibuprofen, but more over it can say, take exactly 172 milligrams of ibuprofen or 42 micrograms of Vitamin K. And if you have any nice implants that can precisely administer exactly the right amount at the right times and frequencies, the results would be beneficial. 

Needless to say that same information, available to your doctor, could help us diagnose severe conditions long before they become problematic or life threatening too. 

We can also imagine more sophisticated implants might be able to manufacture these things inside of you, just alerting you if you needed to eat something that it was low on for manufacturing the required medicine. 

Even further along those lines would be nanomachines augmenting a person’s immune system or repairing damage, but we’ve discussed that before. 

Of course if you’ve got little machines inside you they might need some fairly atypical supplies, and you might have to consume something weird like Gadolinium. 

There’s a scifi book series called Merkiaari Wars by Mark E. Cooper that revolves around transhuman cyborg soldiers called Vipers, and it’s a pretty good read, but in it they have to occasionally drink what they call a “Viper Smoothie” that’s reported to taste horrible and has all the necessary bits for their cybernetic components and nanomachines. 

It’s amusing to read about them cringing while drinking the things but realistically you’d probably only need small amounts you could take in a gel capsule. 

I could easily multivitamins for cyborgs having the recommended daily values of Tungsten or Graphene or Silicon. 

In the nearer term, an obvious application I suspect we will see become the norm soon would be for life monitors that could call for medical assistance on its own. 

We actually have this, but it’s not in regular use on healthy people. 

As the devices get more common and reliable, and as smart phones become more ubiquitous, we can imagine that it will become more and more common for everyone to have a wrist monitor that could call emergency services. 

Obviously you need to take steps to avoid lots of false reports, but it is interesting to think of the impact on society if that became reliable and normal. 

Even on something like crimes, since we have a lot of accurate information to help figure out what happened and when. 

Of course we also have the ability to include in those monitors things like cameras on our person recording events and our location. 

It is a bit creepy to think of anyone being able to see what you saw and know where you are, but with the right privacy protections you could seriously deter violent crime when just about everything is being recorded by your victim and potentially stored off site. 

Of course for all that monitored information to be useful we have to have some way of seeing it. 

This brings up the concept of Augmented Reality, which differs from Virtual Reality in the sense that it is overlaying stuff on your normal senses of things around you, not sticking you in a totally simulated environment. 

I suspect many of you are already familiar with this concept and it is also pretty straight-forward, so we won’t spend much time on this. 

Whether we are discussing a pair of glasses or contact lenses that display information or something directly connected to your brain’s visual cortex, the basic notion is simple enough. 

I’m sitting there talking to someone and information is being displayed for me. 

My heart rate, an email from a friend, the person I’m talking to’s name, my three o’clock reminder to go to the store. 

Now this has many potential entertainment and safety uses, but keyed back into the notion of monitoring things, when I get to the store in a bit it would be nice to be able to look inside my fridge or pantry at home and see what I’m low on, without having to actually go home. 

It’s nice to be able to have a road map display on your vision while driving, but it is even nicer to have an impressive sensor suite on your car that is monitoring your surroundings with much more focus and accuracy than you can and can lay down the road boundary lines on your vision when it’s foggy or snow is covering them, or highlight oncoming cars before you can see them, or detect cats or dogs or deer or kids near the road and highlight them so you’re noticing them sooner. 

A radar in your car that fed the information to you as a visual overlay. 

Or can send an alert from your health monitors letting you know you’re sleepier than you think and need to pull over for a nap and some coffee, or give you a little buzz when it notices that after an hour of driving you are getting highway hypnosis. 

Of course it is even nicer if you don’t have to rely on your car’s sensors because you’ve got your own upgunned sensory package. 

Sensory augmentation that let you see into infrared or hear ultrasonic. 

That let you zoom in on things too small to see clearly or too far away. 

That enhances your sense of taste or smell or touch, maybe even adding new things we can’t normally taste. 

There’s some debate about what we can taste, we know of five for sure, salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami, the savory taste we associate to MSG. 

Some other have also been suggested, and there’s argument about what exactly taste is, but with just those five we have a panoply of dishes and tastes we enjoy by mixing the intensity and ratio of those. 

As we do with color, when we essentially can only see red, green, and blue, we can still make a huge spectrum of color hues and textures. 

If we added a fourth cone, say one sensitive to infrared, could we alter the brain to see this as a new distinct color? 

Or several, as that spectrum is far bigger than the standard visual one? 

Including a device that saw infrared but showed it to us as red is handy, but what new experiences are available when it is a new color? 

How much better a meal if you can taste three or four entirely new flavors? 

It would be handy to hear ultrasonic or see behind you, but how much neater to be able to hear instruments designed just for ultrasonic ranges or truly see fifty or sixty colors, not just combinations of three? 

Of course our brains would need to be physically modified for things like that, which we will get to shortly, but it is also worth remembering that sometimes you don’t want your senses augmented, indeed you might want them attenuated. 

It would be rather nice to have the ability to shut off your smell around foul scents, or tune out loud distracting noises. 

Particularly if this could be done automatically, removing glare or blinding lights, filtering out just those sounds you don’t want to hear so you can focus on what someone is saying to you in a crowded room. 

Of course an alternative to that is ears you can move around to focus on sound, like cats can do, but that would be a physical augmentation, so let’s move on to those. 

As I mentioned, we see plenty of examples of cyborgs with super strength and toughness, but there’s a lot of other modifications we could make that might be handier. 

No pun intended but one example would be steadier hands. 

As someone with a neurological condition that makes my hands shake, I tend to be a touch envious of folks who can work on intricate things, those steady nimble fingers we think of surgeons having. 

It would be nicer to be able to type as fast as we thought and never miss a key, or going back to the sensory angle, to have fingers more sensitive to touch and texture. 

We have a lot of options here that are underexplored. 

Lungs that filter out toxins, get oxygen better, so you could breathe easily in low pressure without long adaptations periods or needing a drug like Diamox to help with altitude sickness. 

Maybe one that could filter oxygen right out of water, likes gills, or even electrolyze it right out of water. 

Maybe ones that could seal up your throat if you got exposed to vacuum and start scrubbing carbon dioxide so you can reuse it as oxygen. 

Maybe alterations that let you eat a rock and process it into everything you need. 

It kind of helps with concerns about food supplies and farm space if little factories in your body can process dirt into food without using plants as a middleman. 

Back to medical applications, what about little bands near major arteries that could clamp down as tourniquets if you suffered an injury causing massive blood loss? 

Now you can’t tie a tourniquet around your neck if your head gets chopped off, but what if you could? 

Someone lops off your head and back up bluetooth connections kick in to send and receive signals from your body while your arteries and veins constrict to stop blood loss and a small backup ‘lung’ in your sinus cavity turns on and supplies oxygen and keep your blood flowing and oxygenated for a while. 

There a things that can do most of a muscle or bone’s job better or lighter or taking up less space, so instead of packing in enough synthetic muscle to let you lift a car or giving yourself the Wolverine adamantium laced bones, maybe you replace them to keep to human norms of strength only, or just a little better, and use that space and energy for other things. 

Maybe synthetic skin that feels just like the original, and in both senses of that, let’s you have that heightened sense of touch too. 

Maybe it is very injury resistant, maybe it can suck air in through your pores to help you breathe, or help with cooling, a lot of these components might build up phenomenal heat when in use after all. 

Take a lot of energy to run probably too, but maybe you don’t need batteries and can derive it from your food, or maybe that synthetic skin could be photovoltaic too, though for modesty’s sake solar panels built into your clothes might be better. 

You can take things like that pretty far too, especially if you have dense enough power storage or generation to run big things. 

Modifications to let you walk around without a suit on an airless moon or swim around in ultra-cold liquid nitrogen, all while looking and feeling otherwise human are probably feasible. 

Lots of redundant or backup systems for extreme conditions probably are too. 

Not ‘a’ mechanical heart to replace your normal one, but a bunch of small pumps distributed through you to provide assistance and backups for pumping blood. 

Not bones made of titanium so you can get hit by a car, but hollow ones made of titanium that inside them included the necessary mechanisms to fabricate bone marrow to make red blood cells and the rest of that space is data storage, a backup or supplementary kidney or liver. 

Some compressed oxygen to use if you can’t breathe, a backup brain to distribute your thinking outside of your head. 

Mental Augmentation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of brains moves us into mental augmentation. 

Now as I said we’ve discussed this before and we’ve also discussed the general difficulty in contemplating what we really mean by intelligence and augmenting it, so we will bypass that today. 

It is very easy to imagine being smarter but also very hard to imagine being smarter, so to speak. 

What we can easily imagine is integrating electronics and computers into the mind. 

Our brains are phenomenally powerful, but they are tuned toward certain tasks, and not designed with many things in mind that are helpful nowadays. 

The ability to add or multiply eight digit numbers is something the most primitive electronic calculator could do in an instant. 

It would also be nice to be able to enter a room and instantly know how many folks were in that room and what all their names were, not just have that data show up on your augmented vision, but to actually know it. 

Search functions of all your sensory recordings would be handy too. 

It’s a chilly day and you want your green sweater, but going back and looking through every recording of the last year trying to find when you last saw it doesn’t help much. 

That’s actually something we are very good at, our brains can search our memories quickly. 

But the ability to recall things from years back with crystal clarity, and to do it quick and easy, right to the relevant memory, is a massive advantage. 

On the more extreme end of things, being able to make ourselves smarter, make it so we can truly see 50 colors not just red, green, and blue, making it so you aren’t zooming in with your eyes to see things far away or small but actually have a visual resolution that high, would require some big changes and improvements to our brains themselves, not just some chip that can see that you are picturing your green sweater and knows you want to find it, then runs searches through those digital recordings of your memory. 

So what would this be like? 

These more extreme forms of augmentation where you have abilities like this? 

It’s worth considering because many of us will probably live to see a lot of this come to be. 

Many of these things are emerging right now, and with better health comes long life, more time for such things to come about. 

I wouldn’t think feelings of invincibility would be too bad, after all there would be plenty of other folks who were like you, but there would certainly be a lot of confidence in knowing that even if you had a heart attack by yourself the paramedics would be there in minutes, that would be even higher if you knew you had several redundant pumps that could take over. 

Even if everybody else is just as souped up as you are, there’s a lot to be said about being able jump off a tall building and not shatter every bone in your body when you landed, or not only not being able to lose your keys but remember where you left that paperback you read ten years ago, and more over remember every page of it so it doesn’t matter where you stuck it. 

One could argue that if you altering folks enough off the baseline with all these superhuman abilities they might no longer really be human. 

I’m not sure I could entirely argue that wasn’t the case, and while I personally don’t like terms like transhuman or post-human, there is some validity to that concept. 

When we tie it to life extension, which we’ve also discussed, even if we aren’t making people super-intelligent and even if they are staying human in appearance, there would probably be something very different about a cyborg who had lived a couple thousand years and could recall any given moment of that with crystal clarity. 

You can envision other people doing this in fiction or in a remote future generations sense, but it's often a bit strange to try to imagine yourself with that existence. 

What if you were cyborg’d up enough you could walk around on an airless moon without a suit? 

Traditionally when you get superpowers you are supposed to don a mask and cape and go fight crime, but in a society where most folks can do that you have to find other things to occupy your time, and you might have a lot of time, especially when factoring in not only the possibility of radical life extension but also the notion of accelerated consciousness, speed intelligence, that we discussed in the Transhumanism episode. 

So we’ve looked at a lot of concepts today and I think we will end here. 

Many of those were pretty far out there, stuff that might be centuries coming or never, others ones we can expect within a decade or so with great confidence, all of them with the potential to really change life here on Earth in profound ways. 

Next week we will be returning to talking about getting life off of Earth in the Upward Bound Series, and looking at alternatives to chemical rocket engines in the form of atomic rockets, in The Nuclear Option. 

The week after that, it will back to Existential Crisis Series for Infinite Improbability Issues, and we are going to explore some of the stranger implications of concepts like the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and Alternate Universes. 

Also, while we haven’t picked a topic or time yet as of the writing of this episode, I will be teaming up again soon with Fraser Cain of Universe Today.

Reusable Rockets & Metallic Hydrogen
---
  
2017-04-20  
https://youtu.be/WPh2jUKTKCA  

---

The most expensive thing about space travel is that most the equipment only gets used once for a few minutes It's sort of like buying an expensive new car whenever the old one runs out of gas. 

So today's topic is reusable rockets, an emerging technology that is cutting launch costs down significantly We will also be talking about some of the fuels we use, including metallic hydrogen a possible new fuel that offers vastly better Performance. Metallic Hydrogen has been getting a lot of attention recently and an awful lot of hype as is often the case But it also has a lot of genuine potential as a game changer for rockets and space flight So I decided we should include it for today's discussion Your typical rocket launch costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Indeed we estimate that the shuttle program, when you include all lifetime costs and divide by the total number of launches, averaged about 1.5 billion dollars a launch The shuttle carried a payload of cargo and people of typically less than thirty thousand kilograms But if we use that value to divide 1.5 billion, we would get a launch costs of around fifty thousand dollars a kilogram We often say that the main cost of launches into space is fuel But that's not exactly correct. The raw fuel costs while large, typically are less than 1% of launch costs, and it is the rockets themselves that are expensive We might burn through a hundred thousand gallons of liquid hydrogen to launch a rocket But that just costs us hundreds of thousands of dollars not hundreds of millions. If you assumed, say, three million dollars of fuel for a launch, that cost would only be about one hundred dollars per kilogram. Similar to some of the better systems we have looked at in this series. 

The issue with rockets is indeed the fuel but it’s not its raw cost but rather all the costs associated to carrying it up to burn it to go faster. 

A typical rocket booster can cost you, say, a hundred million bucks, and maybe a million dollars of that would be the actual fuel, so needless to say if we could reuse that rocket, fill it up with new fuel, costs would drop immensely. 

Such a simple and obvious idea for saving money would one would think be a no-brainer we implemented almost immediately. 

That was the idea behind the space shuttle program Most of whose components were reusable, so we will use that in a moment as our example. First though, I want to emphasize how insane the forces and pressures working on Rockets can be and contrast that to an automobile Let’s say gasoline will average $2.50 a gallon over the course of your vehicle’s life, and you bought that car for 25,000 dollars and it gets 30 miles a gallon or 50 kilometers. 

We will also say that you pushed that call out to 300,000 miles or five hundred thousand kilometers before it finally dies and dump another and dump another 25,000 dollars in maintenance on it, and also that between insurance and interest on the principle of the loan you borrowed for it you will spend another 25,000 dollars. Most folks tend to assume the main cost of a vehicle is the fuel to operate it, but at that mileage and fuel cost, you will end up using 10,000 gallons of fuel before it dies and spend 25,000 dollars buying that. 

Incidentally the mass of that fuel would be 28,000 kilograms, probably about 20 times what the car weighs, which is a fairly similar ratio to what most rockets have in fuel, compared to whatever they are launching Anyway, based on those numbers you spent a total $100,000 to drive that car 300,000 miles or five hundred thousand kilometers Averaging 33 cents a mile or twenty cents a kilometer, and only a quarter of that was fuel Cars tend to be one of the most reusable types of machines we have and even then is only achieving a quarter of its cost in fuel. 

A rocket is also a device that burns through thousands of gallons of fuel but it does in just a few minutes and needs to be ultra light to reduce that fuel and designed to handle the stresses of burning all that fuel that fast while also traveling at mind-boggling speeds So let's look at the external fuel tank on that shuttle, the only part of which was not reusable It's a very recognizable item with that rusty orange color of its foam insulation We used to paint it white to help reflect away light, but it was quickly decided we didn't need that and getting rid of that saved a lot of weight That paint weighed almost 300 kilograms, and no it wasn't especially heavy or thick paint, that tank is simply enormous. 

Left over on its side in a football field it would take up about half of it keep in mind that tank weighed about 100 times that empty and about 2,000 times that when full so it gives you an idea just how precious every little bit of weight is on those rockets if we worried about 300 kilograms. 

As we discuss making them reusable the obvious idea is to include sturdier structure to the rocket, But this sets off of a vicious fuel to mass ratio cycle that will discuss in a bit. 

So that tank contained a mixture of liquid hydrogen and oxygen which need to be kept at temperatures that would make a polar bear shiver, and which we will set on fire, amusingly producing water vapor, and also smash through the atmosphere at speeds that make jets look like turtles. 

Imagine for the moment going out and popping your hood, draining the radiator fluid and oil, then flooring your engine in neutral, till you ran out of gas. 

Imagine the stress that would put on your engine, and please do imagine that. Don't actually do it since at the very least you will trash your engine in a few minutes. 

These are the kinds of stresses being put on the components of the rockets we use and while we can't just pick them up and refuel them Which is a pity because the external tank on the shuttle in modern money costs about 100 million dollars, and not even a million of that was to fill it up. 

Now that external tank wasn't reusable for a different reason. We pop it off when it's empty, which is when you're already in space and moving very fast. 

So it falls back down and breaks into pieces under re-entry, typically crash teams of the Indian ocean. 

Those two other rockets on the shuttle the solid Rocket boosters or SRB's, typically got discarded about two minutes into flight about 45 kilometers up and land in the Atlantic Ocean. Where we will recover them, repair and refurbish them, and reuse them. 

Which sounds great, but after all the costs of building them with recovery in mind, of recovering them, and of repairing them, while no one can really give an exact figure The consensus tends to be that it cost nearly as much to do it as it would have to buy new ones. 

And I've seen a lot of folks argue that it not only didn't save much money, but actually cost a lot more. 

It's hard to say for sure since government accounting, while always very accurate and detailed, tends to be more convoluted than the actual rocket science. 

I sometimes suspect the accounting department at NASA has more people and computers in it then Mission Control has Now I happen to think that recovering those was the right move, even if savings were kind of ethereal and minimal at best, since it gave us a chance to study them mostly intact and see the kinds of stresses and failures occurring during launch. 

And a lot of improvements did come from that, but the ideal scenario would be a rocket that was easily recovered and could be almost instantly refueled after some quick inspections, and maybe a few parts replaced, like we do with airplanes. 

So the repairs and refurbishing were not costing as much as the fuel. This was definitely not the case the shuttles solid Rocket boosters It's also not the case for the reusable rockets we see nowadays, for all that we can watch them land back on their launch pads. 

Most of these designs are still multistage rockets where only the first booster stage rocket is recovered. 

Doing even that is very difficult, and that first stage, like the shuttle's SRBs is typically separated at altitudes and speeds where the thing is not undergoing full re-entry stresses. 

So let's get some specifics and look at the Falcon 9 which gets a lot of well-deserved attention, specifically the Falcon 9 Full Thrust variation. 

As you doubtless know this is produced by SpaceX, which was founded by Elon Musk, a guy who almost certainly needs no introduction to anyone watching this channel, so let's focus on the rocket instead. 

We will do so by first noting that this is a two-stage rocket and only stage one is recovered. 

So it is not totally reusable. We will also note that at a price tag of 60 million dollars per launch, almost none of that cost is fuel. 

and that it gets a kilogram of payload to low orbit at just over 11,000 dollars a kilogram. 

Which is way better than the shuttles estimated 50,000 a kilogram, almost five times cheaper. 

But is nothing like the savings we'd expect from a genuinely reusable system, where fuel was the majority of the cost, or at least a big portion of it. 

Indeed most of those costs save compared to the shuttle can be laid at the feet of other improvements besides reusability. Like building it cheaper and better in the first place. 

Don’t take that the wrong way, I love Space-X and the Falcon-9, as third Generation geek who grew up playing with Rockets, At least until I accidentally set one off in a dining room, and my mother banned that hobby, I've been one of those folks griping for years about how we needed more private space companies out there innovating. They and a lot of other groups, like my friends over at Ripple Aerospace, who are designing rockets for oceanic launch, have done an amazing job making that happen and paving the way for further improvements So what makes a rocket cheaper? 

What makes a rocket expensive in the first place is indeed the fuel, because it is expensive in terms of weight. 

You have to carry all your fuel, and the oxidizer to burn it, with you, and the thing it is inside needs to be pretty tough, which usually means heavy. One of the reasons we do multistage rockets is so that we can jettison empty tanks and not have to burn even more fuel to carry them along. 

Folks wonder why we don't just do tons of tanks, using one up and going to the next? 

But that has two costs associated to it, money costs and mass costs. Both of which run headlong into the square Cube law. 

Geometry tells us that if I make something twice as wide I will generally increase its surface area by a factor of 2 squared or four, while I increase its volume by 2 cubed or eight If my tank needs to be a centimeter thick to handle the stresses I'm putting on it, then if I double its size it can have eight times the fuel in it for only four times more weight for the tank itself. 

So if I could use one big tank that empty weighs forty thousand kilograms and holds 80,000 gallons of fuel I could miniaturize that to something that only weighed ten thousand kilograms and held 10,000 gallons of fuel. Square Cube Law. 

But to get 80,000 gallons of fuel for my rocket, I now need eight of those with a tank weight of eighty thousand kilograms, when the big one held the same but only weighed forty thousand kilograms You still seeing some fuel savings with the last couple tanks, with the others empty and jettisoned, But you lose a lot more in the first half from carrying that extra tank weight. 

Now you might be wondering, "Why we don't just make bigger rockets if fuel is cheap, and a lot of our problems come from tank weight? 

Why not scale things up even more to take advantage of the Square Cube Law?" This option has been considered and one of the results was a rocket design called the Sea Dragon, a giant rocket 150 meters long and 23 wide. That's three times wider and taller than the shuttles external tank and almost 30 times heavier. It would have been able to carry over 500 tons into orbit, too. 

There's a lot to be said about this design, often called a Big Dumb Booster, since it does start letting you make things cheaper when it comes to the tanks. This design was intended to just use regular old steel and got closer to that hundreds of dollars per per kilogram to orbit that you can achieve when fuel is your main financial cost. 

The Sea Dragon was an enormous design and sadly never got built, but as the name implies, it was launched from the sea where it could be pulled vertical for launch by ballast. 

Oceanic launching has quite a few advantages too. One is that you can tow it down to the equator, almost all of which is ocean not land, and gain full advantage of the rotational spin of the Earth for getting into orbit. 

A Spiritual Successor to the Sea Dragon is the Sea Serpent design from Ripple Aerospace. 

The SS-1 is scaled down designed to lift a few tons of low orbit, and the SS-2 design is a heavy reusable launch vehicle, able to list about 10 times that and hopefully prove the viability of Oceanic launches to eventually resurrect the sea dragon design, though properly modernized, of course. 

Oceanic launches also have the nice upside that you could have as big a launch as you want. 

There's a tremendous amount of force involved in a launch, and a lot of vibration as a result. 

We often spray huge jets of water under the rocket to dampen those vibrations out, so they don't damage things. 

Needless to say that is not an issue with an oceanic launch and while it isn't a technical advantage you also don't need to go through truly massive and expensive amounts of paperwork and licenses to launch in International Waters. 

Ideally you can also take advantage of existing Shipyards to manufacture most of your stuff in. They are already very experienced at building stuff even bigger and with similar precision and quality control. 

Submarines and oil rigs being just as hard as rockets or floating launch pads to build. 

The other nice thing about the ocean besides letting you do equatorial launches, is that if you all planning on using liquid hydrogen and oxygen as your fuel you are sitting right on top of a ton of both, so you can use electrolysis to make your fuel on-site. 

Forgetting for the moment the practicality issues, I personally like the notion of some big floating rocket base covered in solar panels, electrolyzing all the fuel you need, and able to shift its location around to avoid the weather. 

Which scrubs a lot of launches and adds a lot overall launch costs doing so. 

Of course a lot of the advantage of the Sea Dragon, as mentioned, was that through sheer size it cut down on a lot of the cost of building a rocket, since the Square-Cube Law cuts into the effective cost of a rocket per kilogram launched. 

Bigger tank, same thickness walls and insulation, less tank per gallon of fuel. 

Bigger is better in that regard, though you start hitting your theoretical maximums with payloads of 1000 tons or so. 

A friend of mine in the industry said that even when they looked at using graphene, that super tough material we talk about using for space elevators or skyhooks, they can only push it up to about 2000 tons, again for the payload not the rocket. 

Bigger lets you spend less mass on the tank body of the rocket fuel, but there are limits. 

That is another way to make rockets cheaper by making those tanks cheaper This very appealing as an option as the raw material costs are quite low, though nothing to sneeze at in comparison to the raw fuel costs either. In manufacturing there are four things guaranteed to drive costs up. Very big objects, low quantity of production, high quality controls on that production, and government red tape. 

Rockets have all four in spades. 

The facility costs are also a big deal, as is the transport cost to the launch facility, the storage and fueling at that facility, and manning and maintaining the launch facility itself. Just renting a launch pad for single launch can run you around a million dollars. 

So if you're doing a lot more launches all those costs go down If we could mass-Produce rockets they would doubtless be much cheaper We could rely on economy of scale to help out there even if no major production breakthroughs occurred, But we'd also be able to test more of them and see where we can get away with going a bit thinner, a bit cheaper, that sort of thing. Of course ultimately your goal is not a cheap throwaway rocket you can use once or even reuse several times with a lot of repair in between But one you can use hundreds of times and needs very little repair and downtime. 

Something we could run a quick inspection on then re-fuel. 

In such a case even if your rocket costs you a billion dollars, you’d only be paying a few million per flight. 

Before we jump into discussing fuels and metallic hydrogen I want to take a moment to note that reusable doesn't always have to be using it for the original purpose as a rocket. 

As noted before on the old shuttleand on a lot of new reusable rocket designs, It was only the first stage that was reused. 

The second stage usually being abandoned to fall down and break up since it will need to do re-entry Those don't have to fall back down. We mostly did that to keep low orbit from getting further cluttered with debris. 

Something that is a serious problem, and which will be looking at in an upcoming episode called Space Trash. 

Quite a few folks over the years have suggested possible uses for these as an alternative to littering space or oceans. with them Welding them together to form space stations for instance. 

NASA looked at a lot of studies for doing that but never found one they felt was quite worth the additional costs and risks. 

It remains an attractive option for recycling them though. 

Especially as we get a bigger presence in space, since just one of those old shuttle external tanks has more volume than the entire international space station does. 

We still have one more avenue for getting cheaper, and that's fuel. I know it gets confusing, I keep saying how fuel is cheaper than dirt compared to the other costs, and how it is also our main cost. 

But this always comes back to the rocket equation and having to carry your fuel with you. If I could double the exhaust velocity or specific impulse of fuel or basically get the same bang out of half the weight of fuel, things change a lot. 

Let's take a simple case to illustrate this. I have a rocket whose fuel mass on the pad is 110 thousand kilograms, and its dry mass, the mass when all the fuel is burnt, is 10,000 kilograms. 

And we'll say eight thousand of that is the tanks, or tank singular. We will assume a single stage rocket, for simplicity. Also a single stage rocket is often considered the ideal end goal for reusable Rockets anyway. 

So 100 thousand kilograms of fuel, 8,000 of tank and 2,000 for the capsule and its payload. 

We will say that rocket has an exhaust velocity of 3,300 meters per second or a specific impulse of three hundred Thirty-seven seconds. 

Which would just get us into orbit ignoring air and other variables. 

Let's say we doubled that exhaust velocity to sixty six hundred meters per second or a specific impulse of 674 seconds. 

Incidentally before we churn through that, a quick note on specific impulse. 

You can get that by dividing the exhaust velocity by Gravity or nine point eight m/s2 Which is why specific impulse always looks like the exhaust velocity divided by about ten in metric. Or dividing by 32 in American units Fortunately both systems use a second for time, which is what specific impulse is measured in. 

But this does give rise to some confusion since a lot of folks think that's how long a rocket will burn. 

Which is further complicated since it is generally in about that range. 

Our systems of measurement for such things is based largely on Earth and its gravity and it is that we are usually using the rocket to escape from. So it is not coincidental that it's close. 

It is generally best not to think of specific impulse as an actual measurement of time and just some number, usually in the hundreds, that tells you how efficient efficient a rocket is, with higher being better, and thus avoid confusion. 

This is also why I almost always use exhaust velocity and not specific impulse when explaining rockets, so let's get back to that explanation. 

110,000 kilogram rocket with 100 in fuel, 8 in the tank and two in the actual Payload, just scrapes into orbit with an exhaust velocity of 3,300 meters per second. Now we double that to 6600. 

What changes? 

Let us assume the same amount of fuel in the same size tank. Instead of two thousand kilograms that final Payload What is it now? Is it double loop? 

Nope. If we pump that into the rocket equation, we’ll get a dry mass of 33,200 kilograms, and 8000 of that was our tank, so 25,200 kilograms of payload instead of 2000 kilograms. 

That's an increase of twelve hundred sixty percent in our Payload just from that. 

Doubling exhaust velocity or specific impulse for fuel we get almost 13 times more payload. 

If both versions of that rocket had cost us 100 million dollars, the first got us a launch cost of $50,000 per kilogram, like the space shuttle, the for scarce a large cost of 50,000 per kilogram like the space shuttle and a second about and the second about $4000 a kilogram. 

Now obviously we do not have such a magic fuel. 

Rocket Fuels generally get us in the low hundreds for specific impulse and most model rockets you can buy don't even break a hundred. 

There's a lot of details in trying to get rockets going that results in us sometimes getting better performance by using some rocket fuels that have lower Specific Impulse than others and it actually tends to be different at sea level than up in the vacuum. 

which is part of why first stage boosters often use different fuel than the second stage, but as an example, liquid hydrogen and oxygen, one of the more popular propellants, has a specific impulse of 451. 

Probably the most common fuel is again liquid oxygen as the oxidizer With RP1, which is either short for rocket propellant one or refined petroleum one and is basically modified Kerosene, which we also use a lot. 

It's specific impulse is lower than liquid hydrogen, only 353. 

this is what the falcon 9 uses and what most rockets use, and the reason is that it's much easier and safer to handle and store and use the Liquid hydrogen One of the earliest Rocket fuels, by the way, was ethanol, or Alcohol. 

With a specific impulse of 338. Just a little lower, so yes, you can run a space program on biofuels. 

The fuel with the highest specific impulse ever test-fired was a tri-propellant mix of lithium, fluorine, and hydrogen that Rocketdyne tried in the 1960s it came in at five hundred Forty-two seconds. 

But this fuel was deemed impractical. Still it holds the record for rocket fuel for the last half century. 

That record is now being challenged though. 

There is a substance called metallic hydrogen which started getting looks a few years back and has recently made a lot of news. 

So let's discuss it for a minute. This is not a new substance, it was first predicted in the 1930s, and we figure deep below the atmospheres of places like jupiter and Saturn we might see compressive Forces strong enough to turn Hydrogen from a gas into a liquid and finally into a solid. This stuff has a lot of impressive properties, potentially including being a room-temperature superconductor and very recently researchers at Harvard thought they made it in the land The main research of this in recent years is Isaac Silvera from Harvard. 

And I will link a short report he wrote some years back for NASA on its possible use as a rocket fuel, and another by him shortly before that discussing the basic theory. 

In that we have a predicted specific impulse of not 3-500 of other rocket fuels, but 1700. 

Let's contemplate that for a single stage rocket, again if we had a full mass of 110 thousand kilograms again down on the pad we would end with a dry mass of sixty-eight thousand kilograms. 

Again assuming an 8,000 kilogram tank that would give us a payload of sixty thousand kilograms. 

Not the 2,000 from our original example. If that were a hundred-million-dollar rocket, that's just sixteen hundred and sixty seven dollars per kilogram to low orbit Rather than the 50,000 per kilogram of the shuttle or when we calculated this one earlier with a specific impulse of 337, basically one using alcohol for fuel. 

That's 30 times cheaper. 

But moreover, this opens us up to the idea of single stage rockets again. Ones that could take off and land and refuel. 

No need for any of the problems that come with multiple stages. 

And you can get away with a sturdier structure, making easy reusability an option. 

Basically space planes that can take off just from internal fuel and go into orbit, divest their passenger,and cargo, land, and do it again. 

Needless to say we are a long way from using metallic hydrogen as a fuel and it may turn out to be not as good as we think or less than practical to use. In the more long term, since this is a futurism channel, if we could get Industrial scale production of graphene to build the space ships out of and metallic hydrogen to fuel them, you don't need any other new technologies you don't need any other new technologies for space. 

Because you've got a design that can reach low orbit with just forty percent of its mass being fuel and you can really build light and durable and reusable with a material like graphene. 

Of course, that same material lets you pull off a long non-Rotating skyhook. 

Even if you can't get it reliable enough for a space elevator. 

And then you only need to be about twenty five percent fuel and your ship doesn't need to be nearly as tough either. 

So you finally have a rocket system that has more payload than fuel, rocket, and ship. 

And you can finally take your family on a rocket ship ride up to orbit for a vacation or off to Luna Disney. 

So we've looked at a lot of launch assist systems. Most of which incidentally are entirely compatible with the ideas we spoke of today. 

But this classic approach of rocketry still has a lot of life in it, especially if someone can find a way to mass-Produce metallic hydrogen and store it and use it safely for rocketry. 

If we can make building rockets cheaper or making the recovery and refurbishment cheaper, especially in tandem with some new super fuel like metallic hydrogen, then launch costs will plummet to zones pretty close to what some of those launches systems we discussed before can offer. 

Do reusable rockets replace them, or render them redundant? 

No, probably not even with metallic hydrogen. 

You are always confined to dynamics of the rocket equation so that these other options still achieve better results, plus many of them benefit from what benefits rockets. 

A rocket hull made out of diamond hard Graphene might make rockets way lighter and more reusable for instance, but it would suddenly make skyhooks or space elevators a lot more viable too. 

Same idea, a possible warm temperature superconductor like metallic hydrogen makes a mass driver or space gun a lot more viable also. 

But they show a lot of promise for making space travel a lot cheaper in the here and now, and also help to open the market up by making space travel cheaper, so that the demand for it can rise, and justify the enormous R&amp;D and capital costs of some of these ideas we've discussed, and will discuss in future episodes. 

I don't think they are the true future of space travel, but they show great promising in being the gateway that finally opens the door to the technologies that might make it affordable for regular people to take a vacation up there and start making Commercial and industrial use of space a major sector of our economy. In that respect the reusable rocket is without a doubt one of the best things to happen to space exploration in a long time. 

Next week we will be returning to the topic of Transhumanism for a look at cyborgs, and will extend on some of what we discussed before about that topic and try to clear away a lot of the fog and misconceptions we get about the concept from science fiction The week after that we will come back to this series to look at alternatives to chemical rocket engines in the form of atomic rockets, in "The Nuclear Option".

Dead Aliens

2017-04-13  
https://youtu.be/k7fLNvpl0c8  

---

One day you wake up to news that we’ve picked up an alien signal, no uncertainty or ambiguity, it’s an alien TV channel and inside a few days we’ve picked up some other stations and decoded them and you can watch them live. 

A few weeks later they all just stop, nobody knows why, and soon thereafter we realize we’ve just been introduced to the biggest murder mystery in history. 

So our topic today is Extinct Alien Civilizations, something we see a lot in science fiction and something we contemplate a lot in discussing the Fermi Paradox, the apparent contradiction between the massive size and age of the Universe and the seeming absence of any other intelligent life in it. 

One of the most common suggested explanations for that paradox is that intelligent life is prone to killing itself off. 

In one of the earliest episodes on this channel, Apocalypse How, we explored that possibility and found many apparent weaknesses in the argument. 

Those weaknesses though were not in the notion that many civilizations might kill themselves off, but rather that it could be the case for such a large percentage of civilizations as to answer the Paradox. 

We did see that many of those catastrophes were much less likely to kill intelligent life off than folks often assume, but a few of them did leave the door open to a total extinction event. 

But again, it wasn’t the idea that such things rarely if ever happened but rather that they couldn’t be a strong solution to the Fermi Paradox unless they were getting virtually every civilization. 

In the Fermi Paradox we often have what we call filters, factors or steps in the process of becoming a civilization which can lower the odds. 

We went through 50 of them in the Fermi Paradox Compendium episode, and we listed ourselves as having already gotten through the first 48 out of 50. 

In that episode I defined the remaining two as not falling victim to self-annihilation, blowing up your planet basically, and as having both the ability and desire to colonize other solar systems. 

Almost every proposed solution to the Fermi Paradox includes all these filters, but often with one or more considered stronger or weaker. 

For instance, even folks who think the galaxy is full of thousands of spacefaring civilizations tend to assume not every planet spawned life that evolved to intelligence. 

Alternatively even folks like myself who tend to be very optimistic about those last two filters, not blowing ourselves up and colonizing the galaxy, believe there’s a chance we might do the former or not do the latter. 

We do not know the odds of a single one of those filters or if there may be others. 

In the Compendium I arbitrarily said each was 50/50 to highlight how such odds could compound to make spacefaring civilizations very rare, even though no single step was improbable. 

If each step was 50/50, coin flips odds, to become a spacefaring civilizations would require flipping a coin and coming up heads 50 times in a row. 

The odds of that are 1 in 2^50, or about in 1 in a quadrillion. 

Which is a few thousands galaxies worth of stars, and makes even civilization like our own, at step 48 of 50, so uncommon you’d find about 1 per every thousand galaxies. 

Those numbers were selected arbitrarily for an easy example of compounding improbabilities. 

Kick those odds down to just 1 in 3 per filter and the final odds drop to about one in a trillion, trillion, more stars than in the Observable Universe, bump them up to 2 in 3 and the total odds jump to just 1 in a billion, which would imply a few hundred civilizations in our galaxy alone. 

We have no idea what the probability of a single one of those steps is, not to even that wide range of accuracy, 50/50, 1 in 3, or 2 in 3, and just that amount of variation radically shifts the environment. 

Whatever those odds are, they won’t be the same for each filter. 

Some might be 50/50, others might be paper thin barriers that 99% of the time get passed through. 

Some might be the reverse, far less likely than even 1% to be passed through. 

We tend to call these kind Great Filters, one that just by itself drop the odds of space faring civilizations down multiple orders of magnitude. 

This series is not about the Fermi Paradox though, that has a series all on its own you can watch and we will be revisiting it again soon, but it is this kind of thinking we have to keep in mind when giving the topic serious thought rather than just going with the classic Space Opera notion that there are civilizations all over the place, typically with one within a hundred light years of us and maybe ten thousand years older than us at most. 

When you start contemplating the numbers on things like that it breaks down, let me demonstrate. 

Let’s imagine that case for the moment, that in a bubble of space about 100 light years in radius we could expect a technological civilization to arise every ten thousand years. 

There’s a few thousand stars within such a bubble and odds are most have planets, a pretty good portion of them probably are rocky planets close enough to their sun for water to be possible. 

We’ll say a thousand to keep it even. 

If we are assuming a new civilization popped up in that bubble every 10,000 years, we would expect each of those planets to have spawned a civilization every 10 million years. 

The Universe is over a thousand times that old and while we can hardly say for sure, we’ve no particularly reason to think life couldn’t have existed long before it formed on Earth nor evolved to complexity faster than it did here. 

But it is entirely possible most extinction events don’t totally sterilize a planet. 

In fact all the known means that we could realistically employ wouldn’t have very good odds of killing most people, let alone all of them, and getting every single organism would take some doing. 

Some life will probably survive to repopulate things and let it evolve again, and probably with a large head start. 

We are the first technological species on Earth, but that’s something we could only have said with much certainty in recent times. 

You could easily have places where every few million years civilization evolves again then wipes itself out, layering up civilizations like a lot of ancient cities. 

We discussed the problems with that sort of cyclical extinction scenario in the episode Apocalypse How, but this is also a common theme in science fiction. 

And that’s the only way you could get civilizations popping up that close to each other in time and space, nearly every system spawning civilizations and over and over again to boot. 

Let’s slim down the odds a bit and discuss a scenario where maybe just 1 in 10 stars has given rise to a civilization, and just one time and just in the last billion years, and we’ll say there’s a ten thousand year window when we might notice them by radio transmissions or other indicators. 

In such a scenario only 1 in a million stars would host such a civilization at any given time. 

Such being the case, if we centered a bubble on Earth 1000 light years in radius, odds are we would have at least one active civilization besides ourselves inside it, possibly a few. 

Those would be close enough for us to hear with modern equipment if we were looking at that star at the time, if they transmitted like we do now. 

Out past this scale the galaxy gets a bit more two-dimensional, turning into a disc, so if you doubled your bubble’s size you’d only quadruple the number of civilizations in it. 

However we would again be assuming 1 in 10 had hosted an emerging civilization at some point in the last billion years and that there were a few hundred within a hundred light years of us. 

Let us assume that this is the state of play in a couple centuries when we have our first manned interstellar ships go lumbering out into the stars. 

Now if you want a look at what those ships might be like and the problems traveling through space, you can watch the Life in a Space Colony series and the Interstellar Travel Challenges episode. 

Those of you who have already seen those will remember our example ship, Unity, that we last visited when it was leaving the Tau Ceti system and heading for 82 G. Eridani at 20% of the speed of light. 

As I mentioned at the time, 82 Eridani is a G8 yellow sun 20 light years from here. 

It’s about 74% as bright as our own sun and is thought to be at least 6 billion years old. 

It has been considered a strong candidate for habitable planets for a long time now, shown up in a lot of science fiction, and we’ve also found a few planets around it. 

Those are all bigger than Earth and too close to their sun for life, but that strongly indicates there are more planets. 

As we’ve discussed before, most methods for finding planets can most easily find large ones or ones near their sun, so if you a few large ones that are also near a sun they are much easier to see and probably indicative of other planets we can’t see yet. 

So 82 Eridani is an old star, more than a billion years older than our own, and longer lived too, since it’s less massive. 

If I had to pick a place near us most likely to be home to an extinct civilization, it would either be 82 Eridani or Delta Pavonis, which is also a G8 yellow star 20 light years from us and billions of years older than us. 

Since we already have a ship headed to the former, we will make Eridani our example for today. 

Here’s the first big thing about extinct alien civilizations on their dead planets. 

Most of the time you won’t even know you are walking around a graveyard. 

That extinct civilizations is much more likely to be hundreds of millions of years dead then hundreds. 

You won’t likely see ruined skyscrapers like we often picture with extinct technological civilizations, or even stone structures like we see with our own ancient civilizations dead and gone a few thousand years. 

If you are visiting a solar system a billion years older than your own, it is much more likely they were dust and ashes before dinosaurs roamed the Earth than kicking around while we were learning to bang rocks together to make tools and fire. 

Very few things will last even a million years, the pyramids might, but they would likely be buried and look like hills after that much time. 

A collapsed skyscraper probably would be too. 

This does not mean you wouldn’t be able to find stuff clearly showing technology once existed but it won’t likely be obvious from orbit. 

Now, that said, a lot depends on how the planet died. 

If you blow your atmosphere off in some fiery atomic holocaust things probably won’t corrode and decay nearly as fast, for instance. 

But more importantly, on that theme, the kinds of technologies you need in order to kill off a population for keeps are generally the same kind that let you get stuff off a planet. 

Maybe not manned bases and colonies but at the very least probes. 

Many planets have moons, not necessarily big ones like ours, but even modestly sized moons are likely to have be visited and possibly more likely, since for example Mars’ two moons are both way closer to their planet than ours is. 

Before we jump for joy at the notion that we are likely to be able to see remnants of civilizations on their moons an eternity later, let me dampen that a bit. 

The moon is literally covered in craters, and craters on top of craters, and they didn’t just all show up one night then stop. 

The frequency of impacts is going to vary from system to system but should follow the normal inverse relationship of size to frequency, smaller stuff hits more often. 

Our nice lunar landers we left behind on the Moon would still be there and intact for a long, long time if we ceased to exist tomorrow, but time will still take its toll. 

Smaller meteors will hit, there’s no atmosphere to burn them up, and they’ll scratch or punch holes in the object. 

On top of that, every strike nearby will kick up a little bit of dust that settles back down and over a long enough time it will bury that lander. 

Heck, over a long enough time a bigger meteor might thud down right on top of it, and not all moons are particularly stable, sometimes they get ejected from their host planet or decay and fall on them. 

But they will last a long time and we will assume that’s what we first notice when our colony ship, Unity, arrives in the system. 

They find a nice Earth-ish sized planet in the habitable zone and want to check it out. 

They probably knew it existed before they ever left Tau Ceti and maybe had probes arriving ahead of them taking photos. 

Now a common dilemma in science fiction is what to do if you find a planet with life already on it or ruins of a civilization but that’s not too much of a dilemma for our colonists, as we discussed in the Life in a Space Colony series, while planets are probably always going to be viewed as prime real estate, they are not the first thing you colonize when you get into a new solar system nor do you really need them. 

So we will say they knew about the planet, and had probes arriving taking closer looks at it that got there a few years earlier. 

I will go ahead and name this planet Amber, since Eridanus was a mythical river rich in amber, and since amber is fossilized tree resin and we often find ancient tiny critters like mosquitos encased in it, so it seems an appropriate name for the home of fossilized civilization. 

We will also say it has a moon a bit smaller and closer to Amber than ours is to Earth. 

We will go ahead and call the moon Shiva, since that deity is associated to what the Eridanus Constellation is called in Indian Astronomy. 

Shiva of course also being a rather appropriate deity when discussing extinct civilizations. 

So the moon Shiva around the planet Amber in the 82 G. Eridani System, 20 light years from Earth. 

Our colonial ark is in the middle of its long deceleration when they get photos back from some probes that did a flyby of Amber and Shiva, and they see some nice shiny patches. 

Now this is a colony ship, they’re not on a five year mission to explore strange new worlds and seek out new life. 

They are on a millennia long mission to establish colony after colony. 

Yet they’ve contemplated the possibility of encountering alien life and we’ll go ahead and say this isn’t the first time. 

We’ll say their sister ship, the Nostalgia for Infinity, found the remnants of an extinct species on a planet in the Delta Pavonis system. 

Bird-like people a million years dead. 

They got word of it a few years back and so they’ve been discussing the possibility since they figure they’ll eventually encounter such a planet. 

They’ve already come to grips with definitive proof civilizations are decently common. 

So when they see a few small bright patches on the moon Shiva, they send some slower probes ahead for another more detailed flyby and get reports back just as they are entering the outer solar system. 

So the captain calls a meeting and the first thing she asks is if this is aliens. 

The science officer says oh yeah, they have spotted an antenna mast on a crater rim near north pole of Shiva. 

It looks like they erected a mast with some solar panels on it, and the height and the angles will have better protected it against meteors, though they would have put it there to take advantage of the near perpetual sunlight. 

She asks what else they have detected, anything big enough to be a base or a colony. 

The science officer says no but that absence doesn’t mean anything. 

They probably would have buried any larger structures to add protection from meteors and radiation, or at least have used local regolith to help construct the building and they can’t see that well yet. 

Those probes were flicking by at modestly relativistic speeds after all, they didn’t get a good look. 

She asks about the planet but the science officer just shakes his head, Amber is one large snowball. 

Assuming the original inhabitants weren’t yetis or reindeers, whatever killed them dropped the planet’s temperature enough to ice it over, and while the atmosphere is not too thick, indeed a lot thinner than on Earth, it’s still interfering with pictures. 

So what do they do next? 

Of course they plan to investigate, but they decide to get the usual colony infrastructure going first on the moon of a local gas giant. 

They’ll comb over those moons too looking for a possible probe or base, but they decide to begin the investigation by going to Shiva, so the captain dispatches a shuttle there with personnel and equipment. 

They decide to land the shuttle near the crater where they spotted the antenna mast. 

The reasoning being that you wouldn’t build something like that during a quick manned mission like the Apollo Landings let alone for an unmanned lunar rover. 

So if there was a base, this should be the spot. 

They start by looking at the mast, and it’s in bad condition, the solar panels that ran it are heavily pitted with meteor damage and scratched up and it looks like a meteor came by and severed the top of the mast too, and after some poking around they find a couple meters of antenna buried under dust nearby. 

The astronomy and geology experts put their heads together and give a rough age of 2 to 4 million years to the antenna. 

They base this on the amount and size of the pitting in the panel, and the depth of the dust. 

This is good and bad, obviously the younger it was the more likely it was to yield information, but it’s actually a stroke of luck to have found something only a few million years old, not a few hundred million or even a few billion. 

Our science officer doesn’t think so though. 

He doesn’t know that this site and the million-year old one at Delta Pavonis were made so recent for plot convenience and stretch credulity. 

Using the Mediocrity Principle, which tells us to assume random samples should be assumed to be pretty ordinary, he now has 2 civilizations inside a 20 light year radius of Earth that are less than 4 million years dead. 

Plus Earth. 

There’s around a hundred stars in that volume and 3 of them hosted civilizations in less than 4 million years. 

By that reckoning it stands to reason life is so insanely common we’d expect 3% of stars to have hosted civilizations in the last 4 million years which would imply that galaxy wide about 12 billion civilizations have existed during that time, 3 billion in the last million years, and 3 million in the last thousand years. 

The only silver lining is that the two they’ve discovered so far don’t show signs of interstellar flight, yet, so there’s a decent chance that discovery is still quite rare and that as high as the probability now seems that species tend to wipe themselves out, humanity might have already passed that point safely. 

That we won the Doomsday Lottery. 

With that cheerful thought in mind he goes ahead and starts a Doomsday Lottery with the rest of scratch archeological team on Shiva. 

And I say scratch archeological team because you wouldn’t really expect your average colony ship to have a lot of archeologists on it. 

So they get a betting pool going on what the cause of death of the Amberites was while they hunt for the hoped-for moonbase. 

Atom bombs, a plague, chemical or biological warfare and so on. 

The ship’s computer tosses in a bet on rogue AI rebelling and killing off the meatbags that enslaved it, and everyone chuckles nervously and awkwardly. 

Fortunately the tension is broken when one of them spots what looks to be a collapsed cave in the crater wall. 

They shine some lights in there and see a metal door with some weird symbols on it recessed a few meters back but with a bunch of boulders blocking the path. 

Someone suggests they go get some heavy lifting equipment or explosives to move the boulders but one of them snorts and starts chucking the one ton boulders off to side like they were made from paper mache and reminds everyone that gravity here is around ten percent of normal. 

Excavation is very easy in low gravity. 

Now it is a bit of truism that the more advanced technology is, the quicker it decays. 

Stone Age technology and structures tends to be fairly enduring since it is just rock, whereas paper tends to fall apart a lot faster and circuits aren’t terribly durable. 

Part of the reason for that is we don’t bother making something like a circuit or microchip long-lasting when we expect it to be an antiquated hunk of junk in a couple decades anyway, we can build things to last longer but this would often come with it being more expensive and less efficient. 

Of course that situation is changed a lot when you suck all the air out of an environment and where there is no erosion or meteor strikes to worry about. 

It is possible that the door we are now looking at might still function. 

It does not matter though because they aren’t going to try to open it, they are very used to dealing with airlocks and have tools for working on them, which would include a drill they can use that will maintain a pressure seal. 

They are going to drill a hole in the door and insert a camera. 

Of course in the meantime while someone is fetching that drill they are photographing this door and cave entryway with every camera they’ve got and in every frequency of light they can, especially the strange symbols. 

Odds are those symbols are what you’d expect to find on a door. 

Possibly the word for hello or the name of the base, but most likely stuff like ‘stand free of airlock when opening’, ‘check suit pressure seals’, and stuff like that. 

Possibly manufacturer names and serial numbers. 

As we saw in the episode Cryptic Aliens though, even stuff like that can be quite handy for deciphering a language. 

If you’ve got a bunch of serial numbers there’s a good chance you will be able to find out at least what base they did their math in and what symbols are there numbers. 

Of course when we get through that door we will find an empty room with another door on it, because that’s just how you build an airlock. 

The important thing is we find out the room is not pressurized so we can go ahead and open the door. 

Which we’d do by removing the entire thing since we want to disassemble it and look for every symbol we can that might be stamped on the parts and see what we can learn about their mechanisms. 

Odds are the door represented the height of their technology in some respect. 

That seems a bizarre statement considering our own doors are a lot like the ones our ancestors made and usually aren’t very high tech, but this is an airlock on a moon, not the door to your closet. 

What’s more, something like the ball bearings or how the metal was made or cut could tell us a lot. 

We will probably replace that door but we have no intention of pressurizing this base so that we can walk around without suits on. 

Odds are good there is no air left in there, some tiny crack or leak would probably have vented it, re-pressurizing it will expose stuff to oxygen, which is quite corrosive, maybe blow stuff around in the process, and quite a few other things which might screw with our site. 

We will drill the next door too, and every time we encounter a closed one inside, since there’s always a chance one might have some residual gases inside we could sample. 

One thing we note as we go though is that the whole place is a vacuum, not too surprising, but our guys know space life support systems quite well and it looks like someone actually opened the place up to drain of air. 

Not fast, the airlock doors were not open, but like they wanted the complex to empty of air in an hour or so. 

Not fast enough to blow stuff around. 

Now we could do whole episodes on exploring a place like this. 

On what we can determine from this or that artifact and mummified body we find. 

Archeology is a fascinating field of study even without the kind of excitement folks like Indiana Jones or Lara Croft experience. 

Every mundane object we find inside has the potential to tells us whole volumes about the species that made it. 

However, we are going to skip to the conclusion. 

This was a moonbase staffed by a small crew of 20 or so. 

When the end of the world came down on Amber they decided they could not go on and refound civilization. 

In a situation like that, if you know you can’t survive or choose not to try if you think there’s not much chance, what would you do? 

It’s good to have a purpose when you are living on an hourglass that’s rapidly emptying out of sand. 

After I’d ascertained that survival wasn’t a realistic option I’d try to archive my civilization so someone else could learn of it later. 

Maybe visiting aliens like our guys, maybe survivors on their own world that pieced civilizations back together a thousand years later, maybe a second evolution of intelligent life from whatever organisms survived. 

Here’s the picture of what happened to those aliens then, when their homeworld died, and one of the reasons why we decided to go to this moon base first, rather than going down to visit snowball Amber. 

They knew the jig was up and they’d run out of supplies. 

They were a lot like us in many ways, a head, two eyes, ears, two arms, two stomachs, six legs, etc. 

Practically a clone of us, at least in every way that mattered. 

They decided they wanted to leave what they could behind, so after a lot of prep work, when there supplies we almost gone, the last two of them sat down together for a last good meal after weeks of tight rations, took some sleeping pills, arranged their bodies to be easily found, and opened a vent to drain the air out slow enough to not disturb things but fast enough to keep them from rotting. 

Then they fell asleep and didn’t wake up. 

Inside this place they tried to store things to last and made copy after copy of historical records on every memory device they had. 

They also carved history and information into every metal surface they could find or manufacture. 

Not every bit of metal though, some they polished up and took outside and stuck up as signs pointing to the base. 

Just shiny metal sheets elevated a bit off the ground and angled so that dust wouldn’t build up too much. 

Those are some of the things we saw when our probes did a flyby. 

On those walls and metal sheets we find most prominently something to serve as a Rosetta stone and the events that killed them and their world. 

It doesn’t matter what, something that killed virtually everyone and afterwards changed the composition of the atmosphere to make things colder so the planet iced over. 

But we find something else too. 

The shiny arrows mostly point at the base but near them, some point down at the bottom of the crater and our science team suddenly knows that these guys probably did not just give up and die after all. 

Back here in our solar system, the coldest place we’ve ever measured, colder even than Pluto, is the bottom of some of the craters on the poles of the Moon. 

It can get down to just 26 Kelvin. 

We find most of the base personnel buried down there with some possessions, even food, like the Ancient Egyptians used to do. 

We figure maybe they sacrificed some of their last precious food to give their dead something to make their journey into the afterlife with. 

But then we think maybe that’s not what they did, or rather, in a way, that is exactly what they did, pack food to journey with them to the next life. 

Even the vacuum and temperatures so cold it will turn oxygen into a solid ice is no guarantee of perpetual preservation, but they took a gamble that it might make the bodies last long enough that someone might be able to find them. 

They buried their colleagues down in the bottom of that crater with biological samples and more copies of data, including genetic data. 

They gambled that someday someone might be able to find them and bring them back. 

Not just learn of their civilization, not just maybe using digital records of genetic information hard coded onto sheets of metal, but maybe even they, themselves. 

It was slim odds all around, especially on that last option, but they had nothing to lose. 

That food isn’t for eating, it contains genetic samples of what they did eat. 

They may have etched copies of their DNA into metal and burned it onto memory crystals or whatever, but they tried to leave the real deal around too. 

Now whether or not DNA would survive a few million years even at those temperatures is hard to say. 

Particularly since we don’t know that it would be DNA, there’s no guarantee they used anything like the same biochemistry we do. 

On this channel I tend to use DNA as a bit of blanket term for organism blueprint, just a short hand. 

Not only might they not use DNA but there’s a lot more entailed in creating an Earth organism then just its DNA, and that is likely to be pretty different for them too. 

We can’t just take the samples they gave us, especially the digital ones, and cook up some Amberites. 

But the crew is quite experienced in restoring frozen bodies, they do it fairly regularly. 

We discussed that when we first introduced them back in Life on a Colony Ship. 

They can freeze and restore people and they have the nanotechnology to repair cellular damage, that’s why, in that series of episodes, the Captain was a few centuries old herself and our crew contains a lot of cyborgs, a topic we’ve discussed before and will discuss more soon. 

But these folks have gotten quite skilled at repairing, cloning, or mechanically replacing damaged tissues. 

And so she asks them the question, can you bring these aliens back? 

The Science Officer says the answer to that is yes and no, they might not be a perfect copy, but that we first need to decide if we should do it. 

It’s not easy, they can’t just take the bodies to sickbay and raise them sometime tomorrow. 

To do this they are going to need spends years learning their biology and their civilization too. 

What’s more, if they can bring them back, this is their moon, their planet, their solar system, and we are working to colonize it for ourselves. 

This represents a bit of a tricky issue, especially since this won’t be a unique case. 

Two civilizations found this recently in time and this close to earth guarantees they will be finding civilization after civilization out there. 

If they do revive these guys it establishes a precedent, they could end up sharing the galaxy with a lot of ancient civilizations, some of which might not be too friendly. 

He also says that even if they can clone up new Amberites, they won’t have the memories of their culture, and while they have a lot of genetic info, much of it is damaged and it’s anything but comprehensive. 

They maybe have a few hundred intact or mostly intact samples of DNA from Amber, not a whole ecosystem with millions of species. 

The science officer speculates that they might be able to restore the dead bodies they found, take high resolution scans of everything and pump in enough computing power to guess the layout of whatever passed for an Amberite brain and maybe restore them with nanomachines with most of their memories intact. 

They can probably have extrapolated their language and culture enough by then to be able to talk to these guys. 

Or rather, for the colonists they’ll be leaving behind to do so, they have their own mission and will continue it to the next solar system. 

The actual colonists can communicate back to Tau Ceti and Earth for advice if they choose or make that decision on their own. 

So this raises a lot of questions. 

Even assuming they can restore these organisms, or at least guess their way to a close enough approximation from the available data, damaged in some cases, it is hardly a guarantee they can restore those specific dead Amberites with their memories intact, in whole or part. 

If they can’t, they are going to have to raise the new Amberites they grow in a tank entirely on their own. 

Ditto every single organism, and the more complex ones might be kind of tricky. 

A kitten or a puppy has more than just biological needs from their parent after all, that parent teaches them to hunt, to hide, that sort of thing. 

Restoring that civilization is going to be a long term task, probably one where the first few generations of them aren’t very like the originals in behavior at all, and you might be working with them to try to restore the civilization as best you can guess it. 

They’d essentially be half-human hybrids, even if the genetics was all correct, just from having been raised by humans. 

It’s also possible that buried under that ice down on Planet Amber are some living organisms, we’ve got life way down in the bottom of ocean trenches that would probably survive even a local supernova that sterilized the surface of the planet. 

You might also later on encounter a scenario in another system where some decently complex organisms had survived and had a good headstart getting to intelligence, their equivalent of raccoons survived and are now a thriving Bronze Age civilization when you find genetic data on their moon too, and are faced with a conundrum. 

Do you bring back the old civilization that went extinct and got replaced? 

Is it even ethical to consult the new species about doing that? 

Should they have a say? 

What about the species you did bring back? 

If you helped them restore their planet to the way it was, while colonizing various asteroids and moons for yourself, and for the infrastructure and resources to help restore their planet too, do they have the right to kick you out of their solar system? 

What about nearby colonies in other systems? 

Should they have a claim on those on the grounds that everybody deserves some other places to colonize and the ones closest to home are the most logical? 

What do you do if Earth calls back and says “Don’t do it.”? 

What crime if any would you charge the Captain with if she said the risk was too great and ordered an orbital strike on the moonbase and its tombs of people and knowledge? 

What if she packed up only the folks who agreed with that decision to go to the next colony and stated her intent to repeat that destruction every time they encountered such a tomb again? 

What if back on Earth you decided that was a monstrous crime? 

Would you build a fleet to go chase after the ship, that’s got a twenty light year head start and probably centuries of comm lag and travel time to buffer that lead further? 

And we still have the mystery of what actually killed that civilization. 

We talked about some of the options for ending civilizations way back in the Apocalypse How episode of the Fermi Paradox series, which we will be revisiting again soon. 

Also unlike some of the episodes in this series, we didn’t reference a lot of fictional works but there are many. 

In fact we actually did reference one, one of my favorite science fiction novels, and by my favorite author still alive and writing, Alistair Reynolds, begins at an archeological dig in the Delta Pavonis system. 

That novel, Revelation Space, is definitely worth reading, as is a short story set in that Universe titled ‘Glacial’ that talks about bringing a frozen survivor of a colony back from the dead. 

There are of course tons of other examples of extinct aliens in fiction, even going back to H.P. 

Lovecraft’s Mountains of Madness, it’s always an intriguing topic to cover because it lets you discuss archeology, astronomy, aliens, and forensics all in one go. 

One part alien civilization, one part murder mystery. 

For my part though, I think it will be confined to just fiction, I rather doubt our galaxy has ever hosted another technological civilization besides ourselves, and you can watch the Fermi Paradox series to get the reasoning behind that conclusion, and again we’ll be revisiting that series in the next month or so. 

Next week however we’ll be heading back to modern Earth and the Upward Bound series for a look at reusable rockets, a promising technology that is making space travel a lot cheaper in the here and now. 

The week after that we will be jumping a bit ahead in time to revisit Transhumanism concepts in an episode on Cyborgs.

Upward Bound: Mass Drivers
---
  
2017-04-06  
https://youtu.be/KerG4ILWEa4  

---

Before we had rockets the only way we could think of to get into space was to shoot people out of giant cannons, which is a pretty ludicrous idea of course. So today we will be looking at… oh, right, shooting people out of giant cannons. 

Our topic today is probably the most conceptually simple of all the launch assist systems we will look at, but at the same time has a lot of engineering difficulties, many of which we will skim over for complexity. It’s also a device with many names: mass driver, space gun, electromagnetic catapult, rail gun, coil gun, Verne gun, and more. 

Unsurprisingly I prefer space gun since there are no R’s in that and me pronouncing rail gun tends to summon up the image of us shooting a whale out of giant cannon. However, in each case the basic concept is the same, you are accelerating a projectile down a long barrel for it to exit out the muzzle at very high speeds. 

For space travel this has the advantage of letting us get something up to high speeds without needing a rocket or on board power system, except for some maneuvering once you are clear of the cannon. They also typically use electromagnets to provide the push instead of gunpowder. This lets you provide an even and constant acceleration the whole way, which is necessary since human bodies can’t withstand the kinds of forces inside your typical gun and neither can most electronic or mechanical devices. Those can usually be built to better handle such acceleration than a human can, permitting a shorter tube, but still a very long one compared to anything we think of as a gun. The notion is to have a very long track inside a tube evacuated of air so you can accelerate a passenger or cargo pod down it, picking up speed without air interfering in that. 

In many ways a space gun is no different than a vacuum train either, such as the proposed Hyperloop. One of the big things working against vacuum trains like the hyperloop is the sheer expense of making an airtight tunnel hundreds of kilometer long and the same is true of a mass driver, except we need to lift the end high up where the air is much thinner, the higher the better. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the physics of electromagnetically propelling a pod down a vacuum tunnel are quite solid, the actual engineering is much harder. Let’s discuss that basic physics next. 

Whenever we discuss objects accelerating down a long track we have a simple relationship between your final speed and your acceleration and the length of the track. If the object is undergoing uniform acceleration from rest and isn’t subject to air resistance at least. 

Your final velocity is the square root of twice the acceleration times distance. So velocity rises with the square root of either acceleration or distance. If you want to double your final velocity, you need the acceleration to quadruple or the track to be four times longer. We want a nice constant acceleration at the highest rate we can produce that people or cargo can handle, because it makes for a shorter track. 

Let us consider getting to orbital speed, 7800 meters per second. If we accelerated at 10 m/s², just a hair over one gee, our track would need to be about 3000 kilometers or 2000 miles long to achieve that speed. You’d spend about 13 minutes slamming through that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wanted to exit near New York City, your track would need to start in the Rocky Mountains. However if you already saw the Skyhooks episode, you’d remember we could use one of those to take something into orbit if it could link up with the skyhook at about half the normal speed, which would require only one quarter of the track length. That’s still quite long, but it means your track exiting at NYC would only need to start somewhere in my own home state of Ohio. That same track could achieve full orbital speed at 4 gees of acceleration instead of just one. That’s an uncomfortably high acceleration especially without a gee-suit like a fighter pilots wears, but comparable to what crews experience during rocket launches. 

Now for a fixed final speed, 7800 meters per second in this case, track length and acceleration are inversely related, double one, half the other. Double your acceleration, half your track length, same final speed. Quadruple one, cut the other down to a quarter. If we accelerated down a track at 4 gees that was meant to link to a Skyhook, at half normal speed, our track would be about 200 kilometers long. Or one-sixteenth our original track length, designed to get a spaceship to full orbital speed at just one gee of acceleration. 

This isn’t an episode on Skyhooks, we already did that, but you can see why I like the notion of using them in tandem with this method. It saves you a lot of expensive track. Of course you can cut that track down even more with higher accelerations but there are limits what a human can handle. This is also true of cargo, though we can get away with shorter tracks and higher accelerations for most cargo. Bullets for instance undergo thousands of gees of acceleration in a gun barrel. Your typical bullet emerges at a few times the speed of sound after traveling down a barrel less than a meter long, and 100,000 gees is not unusual for an acceleration rate, more than a thousand times the acceleration rate that would turn a person into chunky salsa. To reach orbital velocity such an acceleration would need a barrel just 300 meters long. There’s no advantage to that level of acceleration in this case anyway, at least on Earth, because we want a tube long enough to stretch up high in the atmosphere where drag is low. Mountain Peak high at least, and we’d rather it emerged a lot higher up, where the air is much thinner, and we don’t want our projectile emerging straight up either. We want a track that is longer than it is tall, so that your velocity is mostly horizontal not vertical, as that is what is needed for an orbit and is the reason why rockets roll over on their sides after they get up a ways. 

We don’t want to try to build up speed in the thick air or exit in that so we need it to emerge where the air is a lot thinner. The track does not have to be in a straight line either, but bending and changing direction entails its own problems. If you try to turn at those kinds of speeds you will undergo a lot of centrifugal force, which would just add to the acceleration we are trying to keep to a minimum. At orbital speeds you can easily need a turning radius of a thousand kilometers or more to avoid crushing yourself under the centrifugal force. So you can’t just run the track along the ground, pivot sharply upwards on some mountain or tower, then do it again at the top to get yourself horizontal again. This also why we can’t loop a ship around over and over on a circular track to build up speed first, only the Orbital Ring we’ll discuss near the end of the series allows you to run around in circles building up speeds on that scale without being crushed by centrifugal force while turning, and it has the specific advantage of letting you do it upside down so that gravity is subtracting rather than adding to the forces you feel while turning. But you do want to be as high up as you can be while exiting, which is where a lot of the engineering problems and expense arise. 

The reason for having the tube exit up high is to get the thing being shot out of it above the atmosphere and all the friction and drag it will produce. By the time you are 50 kilometers up the density of air has dropped to just one thousandth of normal, and it’s down to less than a millionth by the time you get to 100 kilometers. Trying to get anything up that high and stationary is nigh impossible, and the tubes will have a lot of weight just from their own structure, not to mention magnets, power lines, and vacuum pumps working to make sure it stays as close to a vacuum as you can reasonably get. Though that last gets easier as the air thins out with altitude. 

But as thin as the air is at the top, it will still fall down through the muzzle fairly quickly if you don’t have a way to stop it. 

Now you could just have a door at the end that slid open when the projectile was about to come out, this hardly requires some sturdy hatch akin to a bank vault door that we usually picture for an air lock. The pressure differential is quite low so that there’s very little force acting on this hatch and anything air tight will do the trick, even a thick sheet of plastic might suffice. You still wouldn’t want to run into that going at Mach 15, but it’s not hard to include some automatic safety device that would blow the muzzle cover free if the normal opening mechanism failed. However we do have an option on the table that’s fairly highly tech and reminiscent of the force fields we often see in shuttle bays on spaceships in scifi. This is the Plasma Window. 

A plasma window is essentially a window where we use plasma instead of glass. We can confine a plasma inside a magnetic field to create flat plane inside a cylinder and at high temperatures it interacts with air touching it in away similar to how oil interacts with water, not letting it pass through. This appears to work not just at low pressures but also to ones up to nine times higher than standard air pressure, so this technology might be handy on places like Venus or Jupiter too, where the atmospheres get a lot denser. 

It’s not necessary for our Earth-based mass driver but it is pretty neat and obviously has more uses than just as a muzzle cover for giant guns. 

Of course it also uses a fair amount of power, as does the entire giant space cannon, so we should talk about that next. Now it is being supplied power from the ground so nothing high-tech is really needed on the power generation side of things. My own preference would be an atomic source but anything works so long as you have enough juice. For a 10 ton capsule doing 4 gees of acceleration your peak power consumption will be a few gigawatts. 

That’s a lot of juice, comparable to the Hoover Dam, but certainly doable especially since it’s only briefly, so you can use capacitors and batteries. Or just give it its own dedicated fission reactor or solar panel farm. 

Transmitting that power is a bit harder since you also need very high voltage lines stretching the whole length in order to get power to the magnets all along the tube. All of which is adding weight to your tube which is already pretty heavy and which we need to find a way to suspend at altitudes not only taller than any building we’ve ever made but any mountain too. This represents quite an engineering problem since the barrel stretches many kilometers off the ground and weight is a big issue, so is wind too. With a space elevator we were always talking about a cord that was fairly thin and dense, there isn’t that much force acting on it even during a hurricane, compared to the other forces in play of tension and weight. Here though we are talking about a tube a few meters or more wide that is hollow, so not much weight resisting that air. Though it can get lighter as it gets higher, since the tube need not be as sturdy as outside pressure drops, and wind force will drop as you get higher too. 

So you have to have some way to hold that up in the air and also preferably helps you resist wind. We do have a ton of options on that score, many of which will be getting whole episodes to themselves down the road. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first and most obvious is giant pylons spaced as needed to keep the tube up. Wider at the bottom than the top for reasons we discussed in Space Elevators. This is a pretty mass intensive approach, skyscrapers are incredibly expensive and these would be far taller, but it is physically possible and you are building a tower not a skyscraper which is way cheaper. The KVLY-TV mast in North Dakota, built in 1963, remains the tallest structure in the western hemisphere and was the tallest in the world until the Burj Khalifa overtook it in 2010. But while the latter took billions of dollars and years to build in the 21st century, the former cost only half a million dollars and was constructed in just a month, a half century earlier and lower tech. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could go a lot higher nowadays, with modern materials and higher budgets, so don’t dismiss the idea of using this more classic approach out of hand. But we have two other approaches I want to mention briefly, though we will be saving a detailed explanation for later in the series. 

One of those is simply balloons, though this could take the form of balloons that the tube was suspended from or essentially towers that were themselves made to be buoyant, and we’ve gotten balloons as high as 50 kilometers. Of course it will be less if it is being used to hold up weight but even then that is probably tall enough for our space gun since the air is orders of magnitude thinner there than on the ground, and so while you still have significant aerodynamics in play it does allow you to exit with much higher speeds without being subject to overwhelming air forces. This makes this a decent option if you are not trying to get the projectile to orbital speeds but just skyhooking speeds. 

Needless to say trying to hold structures up with balloons has a lot of issues you have to deal with, and so it will get its own episode, but we also have the option of active support, which I’ve mentioned before. We will explain that in detail in the upcoming Space Towers episode, but for now I’ll just give the quick reminder that it is where you levitate a platform or hold a tower aloft by firing objects up it. In a way it is the opposite of a mass driver since you would have a small one on the ground shooting fast charged particles up a tube, which is electromagnetically slowing them down instead of speeding them up, and the momentum the tube gains upwards is what holds it aloft. 

Shut that stream down and the tube drops, hence the term ‘active’ support. Though don’t go assuming that would mean it crashed to ground with tremendous force, you are talking about the same hollow tube we are accelerating pods in, only thinner, and we will see that’s fairly safe in a few minutes. First let’s look at using it away from Earth. 

This series focuses mostly on getting off of Earth, so that’s where we spent most of our time today, but as in other episodes I wanted to take a couple minutes to discuss using this technology off of Earth. On airless places, moons and asteroids, it’s a very good way to ship bulk metals out. We could have large metal production plants on the moon that were shipped back to Earth Orbit potentially much cheaper than bringing it up from Earth, and it’s also a good place to launch expeditions from since there’s very little gravity and no air cutting into your initial fuel needs. It’s also way cheaper to build the setup there. The Moon and other such places have much lower gravity so building the trusses up to raise the gun is much easier, but also now not necessary. 

We lift the gun to get it over the atmosphere so there isn’t any friction and drag on the ship or projectile, but most places with low gravity have no atmosphere to speak of. 

On Saturn’s moon Titan though this isn’t the case, the gravity is a good deal weaker, 14% of Earth’s, with an escape velocity of just 2600 m/s, just 23% of Earth’s. 

Alternatively the atmosphere is a good deal thicker than our own. So Titan is an ideal place for Earth’s style devices, being easier to build from the lower Gravity, as is arguably Venus, and amusingly the two share an abundance of nitrogen, something that is not too plentiful elsewhere in the solar system but is vital to the construction of extraterrestrial living spaces, be that terraforming places like Mars or building habitats on moons and asteroids or free-floating rotating habitats in space. So I could easily see a major export business on both Venus and Titan revolving around space guns firing huge thin-walled vessels full of pressurized nitrogen gas to be used elsewhere in the solar system. And considering the quantities needed for any big project, the gun analogy is rather appropriate since it would probably be lobbing those pods out at a rate similar to a machine gun. 

On airless moons or asteroids these work great, no air friction, and no need for the strong tunnel siding for keeping a vacuum. It’s just a train track across the surface providing power and something to push against until your speed is high enough you can let go and zip off into orbit. However on a place like Venus, where we do have that thick atmosphere, and when it is the atmosphere we are mostly interested in mining anyway, we can consider placing the entire space gun on balloons and floating it in the upper atmosphere. We will look at that option, balloons, more in a future episode. 

Now buoyancy doesn’t work too well in gas giants, they are mostly composed of hydrogen and helium, the same gases we use to lift blimps in the first place, but flight still works, and one problem with space guns not fixed to the ground is that they have recoil that is going to push them backwards. Now the major reason to mine a gas giant is if you have a fusion economy. Quite a large one too, since while fusion uses hydrogen, it uses so little of it that a small canister of hydrogen gets you about the same energy as an oil tanker contains. Hydrogen has many other uses, its is necessary for making water or ammonia for instance. But both of those are abundant in icy bodies in the outer solar system and you don’t have to fight a huge gravity well to retrieve them. So you probably only start mining gas giants for hydrogen when you have energy needs millions of times greater than we have now. If you do have such a fusion economy though, you can use the gas in that atmosphere to power your space gun and let it shoot pods of compressed hydrogen away as its own propellant to keep it moving. So you could easily see huge versions of these with large wings firing out compressed gas into space as its jet thrust to stay aloft. Lastly they are good in orbit around any place, though especially where solar power is abundant, for launching ships out of gravity wells. 

Used in combination with the skyhooks or space elevators we discussed elsewhere in the series, an orbiting mass driver need not be much more than a tether supplying power and something to push against, to let ships go flying off into the solar system at good speed. A mass driver does not have to be a rigid object either, it might just be a line carrying electric current with a magnet at one end to let it grab an incoming ship, which then decelerates using that line again as a source of power and to push against. 

Sort of like falling next to a rope and grabbing hold of it to slow down, like a zip line, only using magnets instead of your boots and gloves to slow you down. The same trick can work by having a cannon in space that shoots the tether out for a ship to run along, then reels it back in when it’s done, letting you deploy at any angle on short notice and without leaving something clutter up space. We mostly think of using these for getting higher speeds but they can be used to slow objects too. Much as a skyhook could be used to generate electricity instead of employing it to regenerate its momentum, or can be used to slow objects down for slow entry into an atmosphere. 

I should also note that you don’t have to use electromagnetism to run these, but it appears the best option for most circumstances we’d use. A highly reflective back side to a pod could let you bounce lasers or microwaves back and forth accelerating one much like we saw in the episode Interstellar Highways, and there are some cases where a light gas gun approach might be appropriate too. You use whatever is cheapest and safest that gets the job done, and that appears to be electromagnetic propulsion. 

We should discuss safety at this point. As the gun name implies, this sort of technology is obviously weaponizable, but a space gun isn’t something with much safety risks in that regard. One built for getting things into orbit can’t exactly be hijacked for shooting cities with and repurposing one to deliver giant artillery shells, while certainly possible, is a pretty time intensive and illogical process. There are far easier ways to get bombs where you want them. They are subject to accident or terrorist attack, like any of the other systems we’ve discussed but as we’ve noted before, one can include parachutes and explosive charges to cause damaged segments to slowly fall to the ground. They are likely to be heavier than space elevators or skyhooks though, and wouldn’t have any sections burning up on re-entry, so if they landed without being slowed down they’d cause some damage right below, much like a falling bridge. So it is a good idea to build the length of it over mostly unpopulated areas. 

Since shorter versions generally end on mountain tops and you can also build one in the ocean, this isn’t too big a concern. We also aren’t talking about the whole tube coming down either, just the section between two towers or balloons. You would always build one of these things with detachable segments that you could blow free with explosive bolts. 

The same applies to the towers if you are holding it aloft that way, you want to be able to break it into smaller chunks and let those fall a bit sideways so you can let parachutes slow them down, though big hollow tubes or thin towers aren’t exactly going to hit with devastating speed and mass even without those. Again you wouldn’t want these near densely populated areas though. But the departure station can be in cities since that is still on the ground and the launch shouldn’t be either noisy or dangerous. 

So like the space elevators this does allow direct launch from populated areas, making getting into space somewhat akin to an extended subway or train ride. 

A damaged tunnel isn’t as bad as some have implied for things like the hyperloop and the same reasoning applies here. A small hole in the tube does not result in explosive transfers of air, as we discussed in last week’s episode, Life Support. This is an even smaller issue at high altitude where air pressure is just a tiny fraction of what it is on the ground. 

Blowing a hole behind the pod won’t do anything, since the air won’t catch up to the pod in time to cause problems, and if one is made ahead of it, it needs to be a large one to let enough air in fast enough to cause major problems and in such cases you just jettison the damaged section and as much as is needed to give the pod enough space to dodge the upcoming sections so it can then glide to the ground. 

Also the places where leaks come in fastest, near the ground where the pressure is higher, are the places where the leaks matter the least. The first few kilometers of track don’t involve particularly huge speeds yet so you aren’t that much impeded by a slow leak there. 

Now on the cost side of things one of these can get fairly pricey. The estimated price for the Hyperloop is about 6 billion dollars, and we also have to elevate ours. 

Estimating the price for that is pretty hard, and also depends a lot on how we are doing it. But the estimated price tag for the Hyperloop would represent your absolute bottom figure. 

Excluding the much shorter and low altitude version meant for high-acceleration of cargo pods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best known mass driver design is called StarTram and they did put together a pretty solid proposal with costs so we will look at those. StarTram’s generation 1 version had a price tag estimate of 19 billion dollars, and that version was designed for unmanned pods to be fired down a 130 kilometer long tunnel at 30 gees and exit from a mountain peak. Their Generation 2 design, a 1000 kilometer long tube that would exit at 22 kilometers altitude and handle passengers at 3 gees of acceleration, had a price tag estimate of 67 billion dollars. Both versions get their payloads into space for a bit over $100 per kilogram, a small fraction of current launch costs though still more than a space elevator. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also had a Generation 1.5 design meant for a lower exit speed to be used in tandem with a skyhook, and that would have a much shorter track length than the Generation 2 design of only about 270 kilometers and again exit from a mountain, or higher. 

I’m particularly fond of variations on the Generation 1.5 design of StarTram. 

A space gun of this variety would shoot a hypersonic plane out of them at the highest speed and altitude you could practically make, then link it up to the best skyhook you can make. It becomes a three step process that represents the best means for getting tons of cargo into orbit for a low price that we could also build today if we had too. It would have much lower launch costs per kilogram than the traditional rocket. 

Of course we are no longer focused on traditional rockets anyway, and the next episode in the series will be looking at Reusable Rockets instead. The schedule for the series after that remains tentative but should go to balloons and buoyant structures next, then Space Towers, then Launch Loops, and finally to Orbital Rings. 

Next week however we will be returning to the Alien Civilizations series for Dead Aliens, where we will discuss the notion of extinct civilizations and start wrapping that series up for a return to the Fermi Paradox. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For reminders when those episodes come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel.

Life Support

So you are at a Base on the Moon when you get the phone call from back home on Earth saying there’s been a disaster and no new supplies will be arriving anymore. 

What do you do? 

Today we are going to be discussing Life Support, how we keep people alive in places we didn’t evolve to survive in. 

Space is a pitiless place that is full of stuff that will kill us and devoid of the stuff we need to live. 

Science Fiction makes a lot of mistakes about what can kill you in space, how quickly it can do it, and how hard or easy a given risk is to deal with. 

But it tends to get the overall concept correct. 

Space will kill you. 

To survive in space we need to consider everything a person needs to live, and we can rank those in order of urgency, but there are two we will skip which are also the most important resources in any survival situation. 

Which is knowledge and the will to survive. 

The former seems kind of obvious and the latter a bit jingoistic, but there is a reason why just about every manual and guide on survival stick these in bold and repeat them over and over again. 

During an immediate life and death situation our reflexive urge to survive does just fine, and its knowledge and practice using it that tends to fail us, people stumble around not sure what to do. 

But in extended circumstances it is often that desire to live that gets degraded. 

We’ve all seen that happen to folks and while it is a bit sugary sweet to say a good pep talk and a hot bowl of chicken noodle soup will magically fix everything, the psychological aspect of survival is a very real. 

If folks give up the game is over, and they often do so before they’ve exhausted all the options even if they think they have. 

It’s also infectious, causing those around you to give up too, even if they might have seen a solution you missed. 

“Never give up, never surrender”, is not just jingo, because while you are still looking for solutions there is at least a chance you might find one. 

There is a myth that goes around that astronauts used to be given suicide pills in case they were faced with a hopeless situation. 

It is a myth by the way, something like that would be quite counterproductive due to its demoralizing effect. 

Also, somewhat redundant anyway. 

It is by definition usually very easy to get yourself dead in life and death situations, so packing specialized equipment for that contingency seems kind of superfluous. 

Not the best approach when you are running out air either, since a corpse doesn’t suddenly become a chemically inert piece of furniture no longer consuming or emitting gases. 

Many of those are quite toxic, or at least distracting, in an unventilated space. 

This of course brings up our first and most urgent life support concern, which is air. 

During the course of a day a person will inhale oxygen and exhale about a kilogram of carbon dioxide. 

Carbon dioxide being molecular oxygen plus a carbon atom, if you are exhaling a kilogram of it you used up about 730 grams of oxygen doing so. 

The amount you need of course varies by person and what activities they are up to, but this is mostly about how many calories you are burning. 

There’s another myth that you shouldn’t do much talking when there’s limited air because it will use it up even faster, and it is technically true since speaking does burn more calories than not speaking, but the difference is minimal. 

As a rule what raises your heart rate uses more oxygen and vice-versa. 

Running out of oxygen is generally not the immediate problem where air is concerned either. 

It’s that carbon dioxide filling up the volume. 

Let’s assume for the moment I am in a room 2.5 meters high by 8 by 5. 

Or 8 feet high, and 26 by 16 feet wide, for an even volume of 100 cubic meters. 

A cubic meter being 1000 liters, it has 100,000 liters of volume. 

Volume and mass are not the same thing, so for instance oxygen takes up 21% of that volume, 21,000 liters, but is 23% of the mass, most of the rest being nitrogen which is lighter than oxygen. 

The density of air varies a lot with temperature and altitude but at room temperature is about 1.2 kilograms a cubic meter, so our room holds 120 kilograms of air and 23% of that is oxygen, 28 kilograms. 

Or 38 days of oxygen for a person. 

Incidentally you will often see this figure given as about 550 liters of oxygen per day instead, but 38 x 550 is about 21,000, and as I mentioned a moment ago, that’s how much oxygen there was by volume. 

You can get yourself tripped up sometimes though when people are talking about percentages by mass and by volume. 

Now you will not survive for 38 days in that room, even if you could get rid of the carbon dioxide that will start poisoning you pretty soon, because once that oxygen gets down to about half that concentration you will have problems breathing it, and various negative side effects will kick in making you nauseous, lethargic, unconscious, and eventually dead. 

If you could shrink that room it would help extend your life. 

The air is mostly nitrogen so it would get harder to compress and eventually that nitrogen would get concentrated enough to cause issues too. 

Of course humans don’t need nitrogen, and can survive at a lower pressure with just oxygen, so we often only partially pressurize spacesuits because all spacesuits leak and everything leaks slower at lower pressure. 

Before we get to carbon dioxide we should talk about two common science fiction myths in this regard, how long before the air runs out and how fast air gets sucked out through a hole. 

Let me dispose of the second one first, if you poke a hole in the side of a spaceship about the size of your finger, about a square centimeter, you will lose about a kilogram of air a minute. 

If you stuck your thumb over that you would plug that leak and it will not rip your thumb off let alone drag you through the hole like a sausage grinder. 

The air loss will slow as the pressure drops but you won’t pass out till it gets at least under half an atmosphere and in that 100 cubic meter room we just discussed that would take an hour. 

It’s also very easy to find leaks, especially in zero-gravity. 

Leakage rates loosely go with the area of the leak, twice the area, twice the leakage. 

Even if you put your fist through the hull you should have a few minutes to do something about it and random objects flying into the hole would help to partially plug it too. 

That’s the major reason we use partial pressure in space suits and use only oxygen, not nitrogen. 

Again all spacesuits leak a little bit, typically through the joints, and lowering the pressuring in them slows that a lot, particularly since those tend to be the kind of leaks that get bigger when being pushed at by more pressure, furthering increasing the leakage rate higher pressure causes. 

In regard to the first of the two myths, running out of air, the air supplies in an Apollo era space capsule were pretty tight, because there wasn’t much space, so it gave rise to some bad ideas. 

Your typical science fiction spaceship tends to be a lot roomier. 

Nevertheless when power runs out or life support fails the crew often seem on the ragged edge of death in hours, or even mere moments. 

This is just wrong. 

Someone once made a nice table of the volumes of various famous spaceships in science fiction, and came up with a volume for the USS Enterprise-D, of just under 6 million cubic meters. 

That’s the one Picard captained, not James T. Kirk. 

Ignoring any reserves of air they would presumably have that would be 1,656,000 kilograms of oxygen, or about 2.3 million days worth of supply, 6200 years, for one person. 

It had a crew of a thousand so that would be 6.2 years, and at least a couple years before oxygen deprivation would be an issue even if they did nothing. 

Of course carbon dioxide gets to be a trickier issue, that can start causing problems even before you get to 1% by mass. 

A thousand people will exhale a thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide a day so they’d hit 1% carbon dioxide, by mass, in just 72 days. 

Again not really a time critical problem. 

Once it hits these concentrations the side effects will begin to impair your ability to get things done too. 

Headaches, dizziness, and irritability get common and don’t help you think of solutions to your problem. 

All of this gets steadily worse as the concentration rise till it eventually kills you somewhere above 10%, by mass, about 7% by volume. 

So it isn’t an urgent issue on the classic big capital ship we seen in science fiction. 

Even on the International Space Station, which is not noted for its abundant elbow room, at 900 cubic meters of volume for 6 people, it isn’t that urgent. 

You have about two months of oxygen. 

However you only have about two days before the Carbon Dioxide would start causing problems and maybe a week before it got too severe for them to operate. 

Death would arrive probably inside another week. 

Obviously the ISS has ways of scrubbing carbon dioxide from the air, and indeed there are many options available to us, but let’s do our hypothetical scenario on a base in Shackleton Crater on the Moon instead, one of the places often think about constructing such a base. 

Now as mentioned, there are tons of ways to get carbon dioxide out of your air, we developed many for space travel and submarines and we’ve learned even more in trying to deal with carbon dioxide in our own atmosphere. 

These typically fall into two major types, regenerative and non-regenerative. 

The latter typically involves some chemical compound that is expended during the process, often using up about an equal mass of that material to the carbon dioxide it removed, which at a kilogram per person per day can mount up pretty fast. 

Where it is the non-regenerative kind, say Calcium Oxide or Quicklime, you are using that up to remove carbon dioxide, as it absorbs the CO2 and becomes Calcium Carbonate, that stuff shells are made out of, and is then done. 

If you begin with say 56 kilograms of calcium oxide you will end with 100 kilograms of calcium carbonate, having absorbed 44 kilograms of carbon dioxide. 

Just 44 days worth for one person. 

We’d much rather not be left with 100 kilograms of useless calcium carbonate, so we’d prefer some way to sieve through the air and remove the carbon dioxide, to just dump it out an airlock, or to just turn that carbon dioxide back into oxygen. 

That’s the usual notion behind a regenerative scrubber, it either captures the CO2 in some form you can use or toss out and which leaves the scrubber material unchanged afterwards, or does one better and produces oxygen again by removing the C from the CO2. 

Plants of course do just that, they suck in carbon dioxide and emit oxygen. 

We can also eat plants so it’s a great option, but it takes up a lot of space, time, and energy to grow plants. 

Often the energy to remove carbon dioxide that way is a lot higher than alternatives too. 

It’s very hard to separate carbon dioxide into oxygen again, it’s not the path of least resistance, and the various good techniques for doing that efficiently tend to be a bit on the bulky side. 

Carbon sequestration when done at the large scale can do as good as a couple hundred kilowatt hours per ton of CO2, which would convert into about 720,000 Joules per kilogram, or about 8 watts per person. 

We’ve also seen some interesting research recently into breaking it up with ultraviolet light, and potentially using nanoparticles in tandem with Ultraviolet to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and methane. 

In any event, that would mean you could convert your CO2 back into oxygen in a spacesuit using a solar panel small enough to comfortably fit on your air tanks, which would be very handy. 

In an ideal case a spacesuit would be able to scrub that CO2 indefinitely with a power source, and also extract oxygen from water or even oxides in rocks. 

As we’ll see in a bit, that’s not too energy intensive of a process, but trying to get such processes down to the small scale without losing tons of efficiency can be tricky, especially miniaturizing it to the degree necessary for a space suit. 

But it does give us a decent scale for our hypothetical Moonbase, 8 watts of power generation for CO2 scrubbing per person, under optimal scenarios. 

Over there in Shackleton Crater we have the advantage, as we discussed in the Moonbase Concepts episode, of spots along the rim of the crater that are almost perpetual lit, making solar power a nice option, though fission is also an option. 

Down in the crater we believe there to be an abundance of water ice available too, and you can get oxygen out of ice for around 30 Million joules a kilogram. 

The moon is also about half oxygen by mass, even though it is mostly tied up in oxides, but you can pull oxygen out of rock if you need to. 

The energy needs to do this are pretty high, usually on an order of around 100 Million joules per kilogram of oxygen, which would be more like 1000 watts per person, compared to about 10 watts that scrubbing carbon dioxide took per person. 

So it’s a good way to get oxygen to begin with but it’s clearly better to recycle it. 

It cheaper to get oxygen out water, more like 300 Watts per person, but water is a lot less common on the moon than rock and you might want to do other things with it. 

I keep mentioning these wattages because energy is always your ultimate bottleneck, and a lot of times people just assume using plants for recycling is going to be better. 

That’s only ever true because you can also eat those plants, and you need to grow them anyway if you don’t want to starve. 

Of course that’s not all there is to air. 

Indeed air has moisture in it and regulating humidity can be an issue in keeping good health, especially where plants are concerned. 

But most of air is actually nitrogen and while humans don’t use it to breathe, our plants do. 

That’s a serious issue, because plants are always the preferred long term means of recycling air since it takes less plants to recycle a person’s air than it does to feed them. 

If you need those plants to eat, you might as well let them do your recycling too, waste not want not. 

There seems to be very little nitrogen on the moon, and Mars not much better. 

We’re not actually sure how little there is but it certainly is not abundant. 

Concentrations are low, on an order of a percent of a percent of lunar regolith. 

It’s not tricky to bake that out, but it is energy intensive. 

To a degree that’s okay because you can probably get it out as a byproduct of all the smelting you’d have to do to get the construction material to make greenhouse domes there if you decide to grow food. 

Moving on to water we’ll find this is actually one of our easier issues. 

In our base in Shackleton Crater we expect to find a lot of ice mixed in with the regolith there and we can just cart that inside and melt it and filter it. 

Many places in the outer solar system are super-abundant in ice. 

Unfortunately in the inner solar system not only is it rarer, but so is hydrogen. 

You can find oxygen everywhere, and of course the single biggest concentration of hydrogen is in the inner solar system but that’s in the Sun, and getting at that is fairly difficult. 

If you’ve got hydrogen and oxygen you can make water, unfortunately most places that don’t already have water don’t have much hydrogen either. 

So generally you either have plenty or you have none. 

Getting it into drinkable format is a bit tricky, as is recycling it. 

You can of course evaporate water out of any mixture of seawater or mud or human byproducts but that’s quite energy intensive, typically on an order of hundred times more so than options like reverse osmosis. 

But water, the keystone of life and what most of your body is made of, is actually one of the easier parts of our life support problem. 

Energy needs generally run on an order of 1000 joules per liter of water treated, though it can be a lot higher depending on circumstances, but if we assumed you needed around 100 liters a day then this would be a power need of about 1 watt, a lot less than what would be needed to heat that water for a shower for instance. 

NASA has invested enormous energy into recycling sweat and urine, and has gotten very good at it. 

Less so solid waste, and that usually mostly goes overboard. 

I have folks frequently ask me about debris in orbit as a hazard and it is something we will get to in the not too distant future in an episode with the working title of Space Trash, but yes there is a lot of shit in orbit and yes a lot of it is literally that. 

Needless to say you’d want to recycle that too if you were planning on agriculture on your moonbase. 

It’s actually a bit harder in space as opposed to on the moon, there’s less gravity there than on Earth but there is some, and so on ISS we actually have a keg that spins around to provide centrifugal force to simulate gravity to help remove contaminants from water when we’re filtering it. 

Gravity, even in small amounts, helps to ensure dust and water settle out of the air and make sure a lot of biological mechanisms function properly. 

We do not know the real long term effects of low-gravity, or even zero gravity all that well. 

We’ve had people up on the ISS for months at a time and been able to study that but we’ve never landed anyone on Mars with its 38% of normal gravity and the Apollo missions only spent a few days each on the Moon with its 16% gravity, and that was in between long zero gravity durations. 

So we have only educated guesses about how long you could live on either place before suffering health issues. 

I’ve spoken before many a time about using centrifugal force to simulate gravity, called spin-gravity, or even combining it with local gravity where there isn’t enough, so I don’t want to spend too much time on it now. 

The short form is you take a big cylinder and spin it around and the walls of that cylinder become the floor. 

Folks occasionally ask me if I’m over-simplifying how easy or functional this is and assume that if it were that easy and effective we’d do it on the ISS. 

There’s a flaw in that reasoning, the main purpose of the ISS is scientific and the major feature it offers us that we can’t do down here on Earth way cheaper is a lack of gravity, so putting it on the ISS would be counter-productive, especially since one of those things we study up there is the health effects of zero-gravity on people. 

But spin-gravity offers us some problems. 

The one we most often consider on this channel, because we mostly contemplate huge structures, is that spinning something around places it under a lot of force, equivalent to what a suspension bridge of equal length to the cylinder’s circumference would experience on Earth. 

On the other side of the size issue, if you go too small then you have folks experiencing a significantly different force on their feet than their head. 

On Earth gravity is just a bit weaker [oops: stronger] on your feet than your head when standing up, but the difference is so small only our finest instruments could detect it. 

Standing on the walls of a cylinder 5 meters in radius, if the gravity is normal at the ground it’s about 40% lower at your head. 

We can assume that would be pretty nauseating. 

In case it isn’t, the whole thing is spinning around at 13 RPM, about once every four seconds, which will probably succeed in nauseating you if the difference in gravity didn’t, that’s faster than the typical Tilt-a-Whirl they have at amusement parks and festivals. 

From our experience with such things, and more scientific if less fun versions, we know people can handle about 2 RPM, one rotation every thirty seconds, without feeling nauseous, and that most should be able to adapt to a bit more. 

Unfortunately to achieve one gravity at 2 RPM means your cylinder needs a radius of 224 meters, which is a circumference of 1400 meters. 

Plenty of living space but bigger than we normally envision space station or ships, though on this channel we routinely discuss ones that would have closets bigger than that. 

However centrifugal force goes with square of those RPMs and linear with the radius, so if we wanted to simulate Mars’ or the Moon’s gravity, 38% and 16% of Earth’s, the necessary radius of our cylinder would drop to 38% or 16% respectively, or 85 and 36 meters. 

Alternatively if we upped the RPMs from 2 to 4, our radius for normal gravity would drop to just a quarter, 55 meters. 

Kick it up to 6 RPM, which we’ve decent reason to believe most folks could adapt to after a while, and it drops to just 25 meters radius. 

It’s also entirely possible half-gravity is fine, maybe even less, again we have zero experimental data on how much gravity is okay, just that none is not. 

If you wanted to simulate Martian gravity on a ship on the way there, to get everyone used to it, and you found they could handle 6 RPM, then a 10 meter diameter is all you need. 

It also doesn’t have to be a cylinder, or even a ring, spin two pods attached by a beam or tether, and they could have spin-gravity in the pods. 

You do have to worry about wobble on such things, but it’s not too huge an issue, we can use counter-spinning sections, gyros, and so forth. 

Now as I said, and have spoken of in some other episodes, you can slope a floor, using a bowl shape, and spin that to combine local gravity and spin gravity. 

Often when I’ve spoken of this, since it has usually been in passing, I’ve implied it’s a fairly shallow bowl. 

But in practice it would be more like a buried cylinder with a slight curve adjusting its angle with the weakening spin gravity to keep down pointed at the wall. 

On Mars it would be a deep bowl, on the Moon more like a very deep vase. 

You don’t have to bury it under the ground but it’s a good way to protect from micrometeors and the view is never good from inside any rotating habitat smaller than planet-sized, since your windows would be in the floor and the stars would spin around a couple times a minute. 

Excavation is also very easy in low gravity and you can pile tons of material on top of something that isn’t all that structurally strong. 

We discussed this concept more in the Rotating Habitats episode, but it is worth noting that the windows would be on the floor and wouldn’t make for a good view since you are spinning around a couple times a minute or more, so you probably wouldn’t have a lot of windows. 

This brings up lighting and temperature, our next two topics. 

So far our energy needs have stayed pretty mild, well under the normal electric use of the typical citizen of an industrialized nation. 

However, when it comes to keeping things warm and bright your energy bill can shoot up quickly. 

Just doing lighting for one person to see by is cheap enough, modern LED lights are durable and low-powered, and even a 10 watt bulb provides comfortable lighting, but when we start talking about lighting up large sections of hydroponics that changes. 

We’ve discussed that in the past a few times too, and I usually place 2000 Watts as the bare minimum energy supply for lighting enough plants to feed a person and I tend to assume everything has been optimized. 

Not just lighting done only in those wavelengths and luminosities needed by those plants, but also temperature, humidity, CO2, etc. 

Of course the sun provides free sunlight but using that isn’t always a good idea even when it is an option. 

Temperature though turns out not to be as bad as you might expect if you live in a cold climate, are used to an expensive winter heating bill, and are thinking space is freezing cold. 

In space heat can only escape or enter an object by radiation, shining light on it or the infrared radiation it emits based on its temperature. 

That’s the effect of vacuum, and even on the moon a lot of things would be clad in a vacuum same as any vacuum flask, the Thermos being the best known of these. 

But these are not insulated just by a vacuum cutting off convection and conduction. 

That wouldn’t keep something warm for long. 

Rather the inside of the outer layer is made to reflect infrared light back into the inner vessel, cutting off even that means of emitting energy. 

This is something we usually bypass mentioning in most of the space-based constructs we discuss on this channel because we are typically trying to get rid of heat as fast as possible, since we tend to be generating tons of it. 

But when you’re not, that inner layer helps a lot because even if you are only emitting heat by radiating it, not via conduction or convection, you can radiate it away pretty quickly. 

Heat radiation is entirely based on how hot the object is and how much surface area it has, and a man in a space suit has about 2 square meters of surface area and is radiating about 500 Watts per square meter at human body temperatures. 

That’s 1000 Watts you are emitting by default, the equivalent to burning 21,000 calories a day, so anything you can do to cut that down in terms of insulation is a good idea. 

Of course in a spacesuit near Earth, or on the Moon, when you are exposed to sunlight you can overheat very quickly instead. 

Particularly if you were wearing black instead of a nice reflective white. 

The same applies to dome or habitats, properly insulated they don’t need much heating, especially if sunlight is coming in and you have a ton of thermal mass available. 

Which you would on the Moon or Mars if you don’t mind digging down a ways where temperature won’t fluctuate as much. 

Day length is about the same on Mars as on Earth, but the Moon’s day is a month long and you really need to factor that into considerations for staying cool in the day and warm in the night, and burying yourself helps with that and with protection from meteors and radiation too. 

That’s one reason why artificial light, or light bounced in through mirror and lens assemblies, is better than the classic glass dome. 

We talked about that more in Moonbase Concepts, mirrors and parabolic dishes, especially ones that are just polished metal, are cheaper and harder to damage than a glass dome so you stick them around the thing you want lit, and let the light come in through the windows instead. 

You can also use that reflective surface to filter out any frequencies you don’t want, or want less of, like infrared or ultraviolet, or even green if you have a hydroponics area you have to worry about overheating, since green light does little for plants. 

The other nice things about the moon as opposed to a space station is that we do have the option of cooling with conduction or convection, as well as warming. 

All that lunar regolith around and below you can be used to dump waste heat or to help warm the installation during the night. 

It’s a lot easier to dig pipes for that purpose there too, again from lower gravity. 

So lighting and temperature can be pretty cheap, or very energy expensive, depending on circumstances. 

We’ve got three more things I want to touch on briefly before we close out. 

Construction, Communication, and Manufacturing. 

Communication is another one of those no-brainers, but it certainly helps to have stockpile of information on-site in case they go down. 

Manuals are not the same as having a crack team of experts on any field available to help on short notice though. 

It’s also your sanity lifeline home, so you can talk to friends and family, but again this needs little detailing and is a no-brainer. 

It becomes a much bigger issue as you get further from Earth and time lags of minutes or even hours can come into play and also require transmitters than use significant amounts of power. 

As to Construction and manufacturing, the biggest cost and hurdle to doing a moonbase or giant space station is the cost of getting material and equipment there. 

Anything you can manufacture on site, or in-situ, saves tons of money and of course anything you need to live is ideally something you should be able to make on site. 

In space you need to bring in all your material, so most of the time it makes more sense to make stuff here and ship it up to space. 

But even there some manufacturing ability is very useful, and you can save a lot of mass if you don’t need 50 spare parts and a lot of specialty tools because you can 3D print them on the spot if they’re needed and maybe even recycle that mass when they’re done. 

But simple 3D printing, and even the ability to make construction material for buildings out of local regolith, isn’t really enough. 

Taking that hydroponics example for instance, you need to be able to make machines to bake you air out of and to smelt that regolith to make steel or aluminum and glass and solar panels and wiring. 

You need to be able to make trays and piping for the plants either out of metal or plastic and if the latter you probably need vats of algae to make your plastics and so on. 

Needless to say anything which can miniaturize or automate manufacturing with that degree of intricacy helps us out enormously. 

I think that is where we will stop for today. 

We could do, and probably will do, whole episodes going into more in depth looks just at in-situ resource exploitation, but that would take at least an episode and is probably better discussed in terms of each place we would do that at, as the options are different for Venus and Mars and Titan and so on. 

There’s a number of books that have been written over the years about surviving on the Moon, my friend Bob Goddard wrote one titled ‘Mother Moon’ not long back, and it begins right where we started, with a lunar colony struggling for survival when supplies stop coming from Earth though it ends in a very different place. 

I won’t spoil the plot for you, but probably the first book dealing with the idea was Jules Verne’s “From the Earth to the Moon”, where they get there by using a giant cannon to launch their ship. 

Which seems like a pretty absurd concept but that’s actually our topic for next week, space guns and mass drivers, and we will see it is a bit more practical than we would initially think. 

The week after that we return to the Alien Civilizations series with Dead Aliens, and we will start wrapping that topic back into the Fermi Paradox and look at the issue from more of an archeological perspective too.

Upward Bound: Skyhooks
---
  
2017-03-23  
https://youtu.be/TlpFzn_Y-F0

Skyhooks are an ingenious device for fishing planetary atmospheres and catching spaceships. 

Today, we are going to look at skyhooks, a type of tether system used in orbit to help get ships up into space with a lot less fuel. 

We are going to look at several different varieties, explain how they each work, how ready the technology is for deployment, and look at the cost and safety issues of this method. 

We will also discuss their uses far from Earth, everywhere from low gravity airless moons to deep-gravity well gas giants. 

We’ll be at this for a while today so you might want to grab a drink and snack. 

Also, a quick note before we begin while you’re doing that. 

We have looked at skyhooks before. 

It was one of the oldest episodes I did and during a short phase where I took some well-meant but bad advice to keep the videos brief. 

As a result the original Skyhooks episode holds the channel’s record for the shortest episode to date. 

That episode has always nagged at me because this topic, skyhooks, is one of the most useful and clever concepts out there for getting into space, as we will see today. 

I think when we’re done today you will be wondering why they don’t get more coverage, in science or science fiction, something that has puzzled me for years, because they are incredibly useful. 

Okay, introduction complete, explanation complete, drinks and snacks acquired, let’s dig in. 

Skyhooks come in a variety of forms and we will cover all of them, but the simplest one to explain, and thus for us to cover first, is the non-rotating kind. 

This is a lot like the Space Elevator we covered previously, only instead of running from the ground all the way up past geostationary orbit, the basic skyhook just runs from the upper atmosphere to Low Earth Orbit or even higher. 

How far up depends on how strong your material is, like space elevators you’d ideally used carbon nanotubes and taper the tether to be wider at the top than the bottom, to get the tether as long as you can without it snapping under its own weight. 

Let’s consider the motion of this tether. 

Unlike the space elevator it is not holding a fixed position over the ground. 

It is orbiting, but the orbit is a bit weird. 

You see, how far away an object is from Earth controls its orbital speed, at least for totally circular orbits, which is what we’re contemplating at the moment. 

The higher up you are, the slower the necessary orbital speed to avoid falling down. 

Just above the atmosphere things orbit about once every 90 minutes, or one and half hours, at a speed of about 7.8 kilometers a second. 

If we went up about 4000 kilometers higher, things orbit about once every 3 hours, taking twice as long, and moving at about 6.1 kilometers per second. 

A difference of 1700 meters per second, and a big difference, since that speed would get you from the West to East Coast of America in under an hour. 

Again, the higher object is moving much slower and takes double the time to orbit. 

Now let’s say I took a super-long and strong tether and connected those two orbiting bodies. 

What happens? 

They have to move together now but their orbital speeds are a lot different. 

To be in a stable orbit now they’d need a period somewhere in between the 90 minutes and three hours each previously had. 

Because gravity is not uniform we can’t assume it would be right in the middle at the center of mass, also because the tether is wider near the top to make it stronger, more of the weight is nearer the top. 

So we will say now that the whole thing wants to orbit every two and a half hours. 

And that is what it will do, but that means the top and bottom both are also doing so. 

So now the top is not moving 6.1 kilometer per second anymore. 

It is moving 6.8 kilometers per second instead, a lot faster. 

Down at the bottom tip, the reverse applies, before it moved 7.8 kilometers per second but now it isn’t orbiting every 90 minutes but every 150, it is only moving 4.7 kilometers per second, about 60% of its original speed. 

If a rocket or shuttle could get itself up to 4.7 kilometers per second, instead of the normal 7.8 needed for orbit at low altitudes, it could get hooked by that tether, climb up it, and exit anywhere along the way having transfered momentum from the tether, the ‘sky’ hook, and enter a normal orbit anywhere along the way or even higher, since the top of the skyhook is moving faster than is necessary to orbit at that height. 

A longer and stronger skyhook could match up at an even lower speed at the bottom tip and an even higher one at the top. 

Sounds good, but how good is 60% slower for orbit? 

Doesn’t really seem that much of a game changer for space flight. 

But consider, your typical liquid hydrogen and oxygen rocket has an exhaust velocity of 4.4 kilometers per second, just a bit less than the 4.7 our bottom tip, the hook, is doing. 

To get up to normal orbital velocities that rocket would need to be about 83% fuel, under ideal conditions, 5 kilograms of fuel for every 1 kilogram of payload and ship. 

To get up to 4.7 kilometers per second it only needs to be 2 kilograms of fuel for every kilogram of ship and payload. 

Just 40% of the fuel. 

And that was without including the equatorial spin launch bonus that both rockets would receive but which benefits the slower rocket even more proportionally, or the extra drag higher speeds impose. 

What’s more, for those lower speeds we have a lot more options available to help something get to that speed without rockets. 

Though we will contemplate hybrid systems like shooting our shuttle down a massive railgun later in the series. 

But you can see the benefit. 

That is a lot of fuel saved. 

A longer cable can do even better, but we’ve already massively cut down on the fuel per launch. 

It still isn’t ideal though. 

I mean 4.7 kilometers a second is still insanely fast, that’s Mach 14, more than double the record for jets. 

Also you are probably wondering what happens to the skyhook, if it is giving the spaceship it hooks a lot of its momentum, why doesn’t it fall down? 

The answer is that left to itself it would, making the skyhook essentially a disposable device and thus less beneficial since you need to spend fuel getting it up there, and more to put it back into place after each lift if you want to re-use it, otherwise after a few uses it will sink into the atmosphere and burn up. 

There are ways to regenerate that momentum for re-use without using tons of rocket fuel though and we’ll discuss those later. 

Let’s consider a couple alternatives to our basic skyhook, one that just hangs over the ground doing a slow circular orbit, probably over the equator to maximize the equatorial spin bonus but it can orbit at any angle and you can arrange to have it go over any specific spot on the ground at regular intervals. 

The first to consider is another identical tether hanging higher up over the first one. 

It has the same basic dynamic, the bottom is moving slower than it should and the top faster, so you could arrange for your ship on the lower tether to jump over to the higher one and gain more speed. 

Which is very handy, especially since you can make tether longer the further they are from the Earth and its gravity yanking on the tether trying to rip it apart. 

This also means that you can always use a ladder of these tethers with any material, just one after the other, even if your materials only let you make tether a hundred kilometers long, and we can do way better than that with existing materials we can already mass produce. 

But the problem is it doesn’t help with that initial hook, which is the important part. 

Such a ladder is great for getting higher up without more fuel but doesn’t help much getting into orbit in the first place. 

We want the bottom tip of that hook to be going as slow as possible relative to the ground. 

So we have a solution, we spin the tether so it cartwheels in space around the planet. 

If our previous tether was 4000 kilometers long and naturally gave us 4.7 kilometers per second at the tip, if we spun it backwards when the tip dropped to the bottom of its spin it would be going slower than that. 

Let’s assume it spun around three times every orbit, which was every two and a half hours or 150 minutes, so it spins once every 50 minutes. 

Now that tip is drawing a circle with a diameter of 4000 kilometers, or a circumference of that times Pi, 12,600 kilometers, once every 50 minutes for a speed of 4.2 kilometers per second. 

Well the tether was already down to 4.7, so as it swings down backwards into our upper atmosphere that tether tip at the bottom of its course is just 500 meters per second. 

That’s pretty fast, but it’s only Mach 1.5, faster than most commercial jets but slower than the Concord used to cruise at and way slower than the top speed we can make an air-breathing jet fly. 

In fact, since the equator is spinning at just under 500 meters per second itself, on the equator, this hook would spin down there at the speed of normal car. 

And a hook just a tad longer could actually snatch a stationary object. 

Pretty handy, on paper anyway, this degree of performance is a bit trickier to achieve than it sounds like. 

For one thing you have air drag to worry about, but on an airless or nearly airless place like Mars or the moon, where you can also have longer tethers from the weaker gravity, this rotating method can be combined with a slightly elliptical orbit to have the tether dip down and snatch something right off the ground and swing it up into orbit. 

Also,this rotating skyhook, commonly known as a rotovator, is spinning forwards at the top of its spin in the direction of the orbit, meaning it can launch whatever it grabbed from the surface into high orbit at tremendous speeds. 

With ideal materials such a rotating skyhook, a rotovator, could pick a man right off the ground on Mars and chuck him straight back to Earth. 

I doubt he’d survive that trip but it would work with cargo containers or spaceships on the landing pad just fine. 

But it has some problems, especially if you have air, since that hook would experience a lot of drag swinging down through the air. 

The other problem though is the tether. 

Doing a 4000 kilometer long tether is already kind of pushing it if we’re not using perfectly manufactured carbon nanotubes and tapering the tether, but that tapering is designed to make something wider at the top then the bottom and thus stronger, as we discussed in the Space Elevators episode. 

That goes a bit out the window when the thing is spinning, so that the top isn’t always the top or the bottom the bottom. 

We can still benefit from that partially but mostly by allowing the weight of the ship to be included on the bottom when the bottom is actually down near the planet. 

It doesn’t really let you make a vastly longer tether than an untapered one. 

That’s okay, we use a shorter tether but we spin it faster right? 

Well, no, because when you start spinning something around it has centrifugal force trying to rip it apart. 

A tether spinning around far from any gravity well can still only spin so fast, same as when we discuss rotating habitats producing spin gravity we can only make them so wide or they’d tear themselves apart. 

So our rotating tether, our rotovator, can not be as long as our non-rotating tether because we can’t take as much advantage of tapering it, and we can’t make up too much of that loss by spinning it faster because it will tear apart. 

At the bottom of that hook when it is spun down near Earth it has all of Earth’s gravity yanking on it plus the centrifugal force is pulling that tether down the same direction, adding to the force. 

The rotovator design still has a lot of net advantages, especially when you’ve got much stronger materials or are working in a weaker gravity well, but it isn’t too likely to let us snatch regular planes out of the sky. 

But it should be able to grab some hypersonic spaceplane designs that have been proposed, and we’ll talk about those later too. 

We still have a couple more types using more clever tricks, but I’m going to skim past the Cardio-rotavator design. 

Same basic concept as the rotovator, another long tapered tether that rotates, but does so on an elliptical orbit, rotating twice every orbit. 

The trajectory of the tip is roughly heart-shaped so we call it a cardio-rotovator. 

It has a few minor advantages over the normal rotovator and a few disadvantages too, but is essentially taking advantage of how elliptical orbits don’t have the same speed all the time. 

In a circular orbit an object stays at the same speed, in an elliptical one they are fastest when closest to the object they orbit, called perigee when that object is Earth, and slowest when furthest away, called apogee for Earth. 

If we use a long tether that can reach down from apogee, it will be going slower there than normal, and so the rotating tip will also be going slower. 

Because of this it has to do exactly two spins for every orbit, so that the long tether doesn’t smack the planet when it is at perigee, the system isn’t as flexible but still slightly outperforms the basic rotovator in some key ways. 

The last variation I want to discuss quickly is called the T4 or Tillotson Two-Tier Tether, this is a spinning tether with another spinning tether on the end of it, called the first and second stage respectively. 

As mentioned one of the issues with spinning a tether is the centrifugal force trying to rip it apart, and that rises linearly with how long it is and with the square of how fast it is spinning, its angular velocity. 

So the longer it is or the faster we spin it, the more force acting to shred our tether. 

But if we use a shorter or slower spinning tether with another tether on the end spinning too, the dynamics change a bit. 

You arrange the rotation so both are sweeping backwards when it goes to hook, same basic concept, but this system lets you use a shorter tether under higher acceleration. 

I’ve noticed both the Cardio Rotovator and T4 can confuse folks a little and they don’t really alter the basic dynamics of the concept much, which is part of why I skipped them entirely in the first skyhook episode, but I did want to give them a quick mention this time and I should note there are some other variations on this concept, I’ll attach some links in the video description for any of you want to explore those and who feel more comfortable with the math and orbital dynamics. 

Now I mentioned earlier that one of the problems with a skyhook is that once you hook something and begin lifting it up, Newton says the skyhook has to go down. 

It is sharing its momentum with the thing it is lifting up, so if you don’t do something to regenerate that momentum your skyhook will have a limited number of uses before it falls down into the atmosphere, goodbye skyhook. 

Even disposable hooks have some advantages but we want to keep ours for many uses, but if you want to do that, you have to restore its momentum after each lift. 

Now, the obvious way to do that is with a rocket, but that somewhat defeats the point of having these things to assist rocket launches. 

However, we do have some better options. 

First, there are drives you can use in space that are too weak for launching, but much more efficient overall, like the ion drive. 

We discussed ion drives at greater length in the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium but in short form Ion Drives, especially if they can get external power from solar panels, can use a tiny amount of propellant to achieve much higher final velocities than rocket fuel allows. 

Unfortunately they do this very slowly so are totally useless for getting into space. 

However a skyhook with solar panels on it to power an ion drive can use that to slowly restore momentum between hooks, and you just need to make sure ships getting hooked occasionally bring up some propellant, preferably Xenon but many other more abundant fuels like Argon do the job almost as well and it is less important which you use for an essentially stationary tether as opposed to a spaceship going to Mars, you can refuel as needed so you just use whatever works well and is easy to get, especially if you don’t need to get it from the Earth. 

And you can also source those from places other than Earth. 

There’s nothing particularly complex about getting Argon from the Moon for instance, thus avoiding Earth’s gravity well entirely, and skyhooks work quite well on the Moon too, no air drag. 

More on that in a minute, but it’s worth noting that the propellant wouldn’t have to come from Earth. 

Solar panels ionize that propellant and slam it out the drive, restoring momentum to the hook without needing to bring rocket fuel up from Earth. 

Now we don’t actually need propellant here on Earth. 

The handy thing about Earth is that it has a giant magnetic field, probably the major reason we have a breathable atmosphere. 

The nice thing about a giant magnetic field is that if you have a long tether of some conductive substance inside one, you have a large electrical potential between the top and bottom of that tether. 

This allows us to use Lorentz Force to push on our tether. 

By apply electricity, presumably from solar panels, we can basically push off the planet’s magnetosphere to restore momentum, using a trick known as Electrodynamic Tethering. 

This is also potentially handy for station-keeping of satellites, but one has to weigh the ups and downs of including some mass for a tether versus some fuel for a rocket, and tethers are also a bit of a navigational hazard, especially if you’re using tons of them. 

Since we already have a tether anyway, waste not, want not. 

You can also use this trick backwards to generate power by removing momentum, but we’ll skip that for today. 

Now Electrodynamic tethering would certainly seem preferable to ion drives, no fuel or propellant at all, but as I mentioned, skyhooks can be used in more places than just Earth, and not all of those would have a nice big magnetic field to use. 

By the way while we are speaking of magnets, I should probably mention that the hook itself, the thing that grabs the payload down at the bottom tip, doesn’t have to be anything mechanical, a nice big electromagnet that can slam onto the metal frame of whatever you’re hooking minimizes some of the problems matching up speeds. 

If you’ve ever seen a mid-air refueling you can kinda guess this is not exactly a simple operation especially when everything is moving supersonic. 

But we have the option for electrodynamic tethering or ion drives or some others for regenerating momentum. 

Which of those you do might depend on where you are doing it. 

On an airless rock like our moon a skyhook could flat out swing down to just over the ground and grab something, the rotavator version using conventional materials could pick stuff right off the ground because there’s no air drag. 

Of course our moon and most airless places do not have very strong magnetic fields so odds are good you’d want to go the ion thruster route instead. 

But skyhooks would work great for the moon, though, since we already have materials strong enough for building a space elevator there it might seem a bit redundant, but remember that a skyhook doesn’t just pick you off the ground, the rotating kind accelerate you very quickly and fling you away at high speeds, and don’t require as long a tether length, compared to a space elevator. 

Mars would be an ideal case since it has very little air but still has strong enough gravity to make a space elevator a dubious proposition. 

Skyhooks are also handy for de-orbiting on airless planets too, where we have no drag to help us slow down, since we can arrange for them to lower a ship’s speeds as easily as increase it. 

They also have applications in places where a space elevator is unlikely to ever be practical, like a gas giant. 

Those typically have huge magnetospheres to help recover momentum and they also have huge amounts of gravity that would snap an elevator, plus no ground or sea to tether anything to at the bottom. 

Bases on gas giants either need to be super-light to float in low-density hydrogen and helium gas those are made of, or constantly flying to generate lift, also a topic for another time, but skyhooks might be advantageous there too, or even for working near the Sun, and we used some similar tricks to electrodynamic tethering when we discussed harvesting material from the Sun in the Starlifting episode. 

Of course one of the problems with tethers is they can only be so long before they’d break, same as a space elevator, these things rely on tensile strength. 

As I mentioned earlier we could essentially build a ladder out of multiple skyhooks, rotating or non-rotating. 

Transferring between them is a bit of an exercise in good timing but nothing even the simplest modern computer couldn’t handle. 

Your ladder, composed of rotating or non-rotating hooks, or a combination of both, can include as many components as you like, and each one as long as the material will comfortably permit based on its strength, the gravity at that distance, and the centrifugal force it experiences if spinning. 

This sort of skyhook ladder, combined with electrodynamic tether momentum regeneration, ensures that you can get off any planet relatively cheaply, even ones more massive than Earth, and even if you never figure out how to mass manufacture super-strong materials like Graphene, as good old Zylon or Kevlar will do the trick. 

And you can have multiple hooks in the same orbit, even at a different orbital angle, to ensure you can do a lot of pickups and cut down on time delays of waiting for higher hooks to come back around for a transfer. 

However these are long cables and even the non-rotating ones are a bit of hazard, so you don’t want to clutter space up with too many of them without doing some very careful coordination of orbits. 

This does raise safety issues though. 

Skyhooks are also probably the safest of the launch systems we will look at in this series. 

These move around the planet quite quickly, so if they drop into that atmosphere they just burn up. 

As with the space elevator we have the option to include the occasional explosive charge to break the hooks into smaller bits. 

It shouldn’t really be necessary to do so but something I forgot to mention in the Space Elevator episode is that proper spacing and timing of explosives on tethers, skyhooks or space elevators, can help you control where they drop, which is handy since most of the planet is ocean and even most land is sparsely populated. 

Better the ocean than land, but better a wheat field in Kansas than New York City. 

Again, though, these will reliably burn up in the atmosphere so there’s little need to worry, nor would they do much damage if they hit. 

The big safety issue is the hook and the plane not matching up or it snapping when the hook was made, but that is one of the reasons why a plane carrying a payload is preferable. 

A plane can more safely and easily maneuver to an airport to land. 

So if you miss a hook the plane just diverts to an airport or loops around to return to its launch site. 

They are a bit of hazard to space navigation and also vulnerable to space debris hanging around orbit, but not too much of one for the former and we’ll talk about the latter soon but not today. 

Overall skyhooks are quite safe, safer than rockets I suspect, particularly once they’ve had as much service time for us to learn their quirks and hazards as we have with rockets. 

But even more than the safety, the nice thing about skyhooks is that they are cheap. 

They don’t offer the same super-low launch costs a space elevator does but they come close and are way cheaper to deploy. 

This is a technology we already have and which wouldn’t need a lot of prototyping. 

It is just an immense cord, and though the momentum regeneration angle is a bit trickier that is also on very solid and old scientific footing. 

R&amp;D is needed but more in the way a new car design needs it, as opposed to trying to build a hover car or something. 

Also while neither Kevlar or Zylon are cheap, compared to steel, they are in the dollars per kilogram range. 

So if we imagined a cable of it 200 kilometers long, massing, say, a 100 grams a meter, or 100 kilograms a kilometer, that cable would only mass 20,000 kilograms, which is on the heavy end of a normal single launch but quite doable, and would only cost you a couple hundred thousand bucks to manufacture though presumably several hundred million bucks to launch. 

Since they would instantly save you a big chunk on launch costs of every future flight, it pays for itself after just a handful of launches. 

If you were pretty confident that your electrodynamic tethering would work first try, you could even use the hook to snatch up all solar panels and equipment needed for regenerating the hooks momentum on your second launch. 

So unlike the Space Elevator and most of the other systems we will look at, it does not have the huge initial capital investments of R&amp;D, prototyping, and construction. 

It doesn’t offer you quite the same super-low costs per kilogram launched some of the other options have, or the ability to move truly huge amounts of cargo back and forth to space, nor can you can use these right next to your big cities, sonic booms and all, but it is a strong candidate for near-term use. 

Safe, cheap and relatively low tech. 

In fact your biggest R&amp;D cost would probably be those hypersonic planes meant to connect to the hook, though there are some alternatives we will discuss for getting spaceships up to the necessary hooking speed besides hypersonic jets. 

Back at the turn of the century, when we were thinking about replacing our space shuttles with space planes, Boeing worked out a system using skyhooks called HASTOL, the Hypersonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch System, in a partnership with Tethers Unlimited. 

It used a hypersonic airplane to get up to the highest speed an air-breathing jet could pull off, then link to a spinning tether. 

Typically releasing a payload to attach to the tether since the plane is then useless mass, which can then go land elsewhere, refuel and reload and do it again. 

The idea didn’t go much past the drawing board, but not because the tech wasn’t promising or was too blue sky, we never did replac the space shuttles with spaceplanes as was the general assumption we would do at the time, and this was one of the stronger candidates. 

You don’t necessarily need to use hypersonic planes either, it can be adapted to work with conventional rockets it’s just that the planes would tend to be cheaper once you got done with the R&amp;D. 

I’m not sure which companies are looking at skyhooks right now, a lot of folks are mostly focused on reusable rockets at the moment and that is very promising technology we’ll be looking at soon too. 

Also, again, you can adapt skyhooks to work with those too, so I think as that technology progresses skyhooks will get a second look for possible use with them. 

If not, they will likely make an appearance to work in tandem with some of the other systems we will discuss in future episodes, they’re very much a launch-assist option, meant to be used as a hybrid with something else that helps them get up to that necessary hooking speed. 

I think we will stop there for today, hopefully by now you see why I felt this system deserved longer coverage than I gave it in the original episode, and it remains my personal favorite in terms of near-term technology to make space cheaper. 

As we’ve seen, the skyhook is cheap to construct and launch, the main costs being related to the development and production of a fleet of hypersonic airplanes. 

While the launch cost reductions are not on par with, say, the space elevator or the orbital ring, it still offers considerable reductions in launch costs. 

We will look at the orbital ring later in the series. 

Next week, though we will take a look at Life Support, and look not at ways of getting into space, but ways of staying alive in space, and we will look at a lot of the options available and try to give some solidity to them. 

After that we will return to this series to look at Mass Drivers and similar concepts for getting into space, or at least up to high speeds, by accelerating a ship down a long tunnel like a cannon shot.

Quantum Computing

Quantum Computing So today we are talking about Quantum Computers, a potential breakthrough technology that may have virtually unlimited applications, much like normal computers. 

Unfortunately, like a lot of technology, especially anything with the word ‘Quantum’ in it, Quantum Computing has picked up a lot of myth and not a lot of clear explanation. 

This is always our problem with Quantum, it is not a very common sense or intuitive area of study, and this confusion gets exacerbated a lot by both the terminology and the tendency of quantum to attract both bad explanations from folks who don’t understand it as well as they should to be explaining it, and the sheer amount of philosophical and mystical ponderings that it tends to inspire. 

If you’ve read or watched any explanations of quantum computing or quantum entanglement before you will probably have heard the term superposition for instance. 

It’s vitally important to explaining the concept, but the term itself is usually not well explained. 

Quantum for instance was a regular old variation of the word quantity until about a century ago, a quantum or quanta is just a piece of something, a quantity. 

Measuring very tiny quantities of energy, of light for instance, which acts a lot like a wave normally, made us start noticing that the light came in rather discrete and specific packages, or quanta, which we eventually determined were photons, particles of light with a size and energy content specific to their color. 

The weird paradox between the wave-like quality of light and these particle quantums of light led to the field of quantum mechanics. 

And almost nobody uses the term quanta for anything else anymore, so the term now seems a bit obscure when it was never intended to be. 

The same thing for Quantum Entanglement. 

Two or more particles can get themselves tangled together, which is to say what happens to one effects the other. 

Entangling two particles is pretty straightforward. 

Keeping many of them all entangled with each other and in a way we can look at is way harder, it is however necessary for Quantum Computing. 

The more particles you have entangled together, the more computing you can do, and it rises exponentially, so double the number of entangled particles does a lot more than double your computing power. 

Now superposition is both a bit trickier and easier to explain. 

For the most part it just means several things sharing the same spot or position, usually waves, and in quantum everything is a wave unless you are actually looking at it at the moment. 

Quantum isn’t weird because of what it discusses, that just seems arcane because of the math, what is weird about quantum is that all the randomness and uncertainty appears to be real, not just us not knowing. 

For instance there is nothing weird about being told that inside a closed box is a cat who may or may not be dead and you won’t know until you open it. 

I can’t remember most of what is in my desk drawers let alone where each item is in that drawer, but I know that everything is in the spot I last left it and if not there’s a reason, stuff got shaken round when I closed or opened it for instance. 

I could build up a mathematical model of what is likely to be in those drawers, or somebody else’s desk I was peeking around in, and what the percentages are of, say, an unsharpened pencil, a paperclip, and so on. 

The weird thing about quantum is that when I shut that drawer everything is genuinely existing in a weird and actual haze of uncertainty until I open the drawer back up and observe the contents, in which case everything settles back into one spot. 

I abhor the dead cat analogy of Schrodinger’s thought experiment, and it was just a thought experiment, it works just as well with say a hungry and a fed cat. 

He did have a cat incidentally – named Milton if you’re curious – but there’s no indication he would ever have tried to perform the actual experiment. 

But in the classic example of the cat in the box, you can just substitute the vial of poison for a tin of cat catfood that is opened by a particle decay. 

Same scenario, but instead of the cat being simultaneously alive and dead, you instead just have a fed and sleeping cat or a hungry and irritable cat. 

In real life I can’t tell which cat exists, at least if the box is truly closed off from the outside world till you open it. 

In reality cats are often fairly noisy in boxes and hearing what is going on is the same as opening the lid and looking inside. 

If I don’t know which, I have to assume either could be true, that the box has two realities superimposed on each other, in superposition, until I open the box and collapse the probability to 0% for one option and 100% for the other. 

Again the only weird thing about quantum is that my uncertainty isn’t just ignorance of what’s going on inside, but the implication that we genuinely have two different co-existing states of existence in superposition till I look and actually collapse one of those states to 0% and raise the other to 100%. 

For the quantum entanglement option we can treat our cat as a particle. 

Let’s say we have two boxes sitting next to each other and each has a tin of cat food with a particle detector on it. 

It will open one can or the other randomly when I shut both lids, it can be either one but just one. 

So I put one cat, Milton, into one box, and in the other I stick another cat. 

We will say Prospero, one of my own cats and the one sitting on my desk at the moment as I write this. 

When I shut both lids a particle spits out and can go left or right, if it goes one way it opens one lid, and the other for the other way. 

So there is a 50/50 chance of either can opening, but in doing so the other can’t open. 

Incidentally this doesn’t have to be 50/50, we could arrange our experiment so there was a 90% chance of the can on the left opening and only 10% for the can on the right, and the same number of possible states exist, just the odds change. 

With just one cat, we only have two states, that cat is fed or hungry. 

Now we have two cats who could be either fed or hungry but their states are entangled, if one is fed the other is still hungry, so we can’t have two fed cats or two hungry cats, so we still only have two possible states of existence. 

Milton and Prospero are entangled. 

Now even if I pick up one box and carry it into another room, they are still entangled. 

I could transport Prospero’s box to the other side of the solar system and open it, see him sleeping contentedly inside after eating, and know instantly that Milton is back on Earth in his box angrily waiting on dinner. 

This is that spooky action at a distance we often talk about in Quantum, because this information goes faster than light. 

And again, there’s nothing weird about that knowledge, if I stick a letter in one envelope and nothing in another and mail both to different addresses without looking at which address got sent which letter, I know which one had the letter at it the moment I check either envelope, doesn’t matter if the other letter was mailed to the Andromeda Galaxy. 

It’s only ‘spooky’ in the quantum case because all indications are that those two possible states were both actually going on until we looked inside, not just probabilities whose uncertainty was simply because we personally didn’t know. 

Also, by the way, I could have made 4 states instead of just 2. 

Instead of allowing my random quantum particle to go left or right and trigger food for either Milton or Prospero, I could have let it go up or down too, and for up it releases a catnip-covered toy to Prospero and on down to Milton instead. 

Now I’d have four equally likely states, all simultaneously existing, or in superposition. 

And I could skew those odds by setting up the sensors so up or down were each only say 10% likely to occur, and left and right each 40%, instead of each 25%. 

Nothing is changed but the probabilities. 

I could set it up so it was 97% likely to give Milton the toy and only 1% for each other option, same results. 

Now I could also entangle three cats. 

I could set up another box and drop my cat Link in there. 

Going back to my original experiment, Milton or Prospero gets fed, we could rig things up so if Milton got fed Link got fed too, and if Prospero got fed, Link got the catnip toy instead. 

Now all three of them are entangled, by observing the contents of any box I know what happened in the other two boxes. 

In classic computing we could say each of those boxes contained information, hungry or fed, 0 or 1, a single bit of data. 

In quantum computing we have a qubit instead, or a quantum bit. 

The term qubit dates back to a 1983 paper on the concept of quantum money by Stephen Wiesner though it was coined by Ben Schumacher. 

He liked its similar sound to the cubit, the length of measure of about half a meter commonly used in the Bible. 

The qubit is the basis of quantum computing much as the bit is for classical computing, and just as eight bits makes a byte, eight qubits makes a qubyte. 

But whereas a bit can only be 0 or 1, a qubit can be a 0, a 1, or anywhere in between that. 

A classic byte, as 8 bits, can be any of 2^8 or 256 possible permutations, typically this is our smallest actual bit of addressable memory, because it can be one character, a number or a letter or a symbol. 

So hypothetically you could store any letter, number or symbol on a byte, but on a qubyte you could in theory be storing all 256 of them at once. 

Of course when you go to look at that qubyte it would collapse states to one specific letter, and presumably a random one, which would seem to make it not very useful. 

What’s useful is on the calculation side. 

A classic computer uses bits and logic gates to do calculations. 

A Quantum computer using Quantum Logic Gates does that too, but while the classic computer will perform one calculation off that one set of digits, the quantum one is going to do calculate those digits too… all of them. 

Hard to picture if you’re not too familiar with core concepts of computing so let’s use our box analogy, only this time it’s a room not a box, and I stick a person inside it. 

And what are quantum random objects is going to be is two numbers, each between 0 and 9, each selected randomly. 

And I tell that person that when they see those they are to multiply them up. 

I close the door and hit the quantum switch, and two numbers pop up. 

We now have 100 states. 

One where the person saw two zeroes and got 0, one where it was a 1 and a 0 and they got 0, one where it was 0 and 1 and they got the same, and so on, all the way up 9 x 9 = 81. 

100 simultaneous states and calculations all going on in that room, until I open the box and 99 of those states collapse leaving the one state that remains, 6 x 7 = 42. 

Now how would that be useful? 

I’m going to stretch the science here a bit to make it intuitive, real world analogies for Quantum are always a bit iffy. 

So, imagine I told the person that if they got 42 as an answer they should open the door and step outside. 

There’s only two people who can come walking out that door, the one who got 6 x 7 and the one who got 7 x 6. 

Now imagine I had a spreadsheet that had two columns, name and phone number, thousands of names and numbers but somebody jumbled the sheet, names are no longer linked to numbers. 

I’ve still got a phone book but it is hard copy, not digital. 

I’ve got someone’s phone number but I don’t know the name attached and need it quick. 

I could rig up my room and quantum switch so it randomly picked and displayed a name on the wall. 

Then I could send someone in there with a phonebook and ask them to look up that random name, and if it matches the phone number I’ve handed them on entering to step outside and give me that name. 

They step in and the quantum event goes off and displays a truly randomly selected name out of my spreadsheet. 

Instantly the room is jumped up to tens of thousands of states in superposition as that person is looking up every single name at once. 

But a few moments later only one of them steps out that door, and it’s the one who had the right name for my phone number. 

To him that was freakishly good luck, just happening to get the name that matched that phone number. 

That’s a big application for quantum computers, as a search method. 

It looks up every value but only the state that was correct, which found the right entry, is shown. 

If you do it right of course, the analogy I used wouldn’t work in practice, beyond macroscopic examples of quantum, like the cat in the box, not really being practically viable, a human is a very complex machine which themselves operate close enough to the quantum level that random stuff can probably spill out. 

Consider, one of our states is the guy in the room getting served the right name for the number, but with something as complex as human thinking, another of those states would be that person getting the name right before that number, and seeing the desired number right below it. 

A second chance to be right, which is fine, but they might also accidentally think that was the number for their name and jot that down and exit. 

Ditto someone might get a name that had a phone number one digit off or transposed and right that down and exit. 

Yet another might pat themselves down looking for their pen, miss it, and step out of the room to get a pen, and another might get served a name that matches their own and step out to tell you about the funny coincidence. 

In quantum, anything which can happen has a probability of happening, and would have a state in that superposition, it might be incredibly tiny but there’s always a risk of error with a quantum computer, and it’s going to be a lot higher with a giant and complex system like a human in a room. 

You only get to see one state and you want a system where the right answer is 99.99999% likely to be the one you’re shown. 

It’s very unlikely that the guy is going to walk out of the room to inform you that his pen and paper underwent spontaneous quantum weirdness and turned into a slice of cheesecake, its possible but absurdly unlikely, so we’re not concerned about that one, but it’s quite likely they might make an error when looking at their name and comparing it to the desired phone number. 

The key thing though is that a quantum computer can do a search that no classic computer could possibly do, even a giant Matrioshka Brain. 

A Matrioshka Brain couldn’t search the Library of Babel and find Shakespeare’s Tempest in it. 

A quantum computer could. 

Similarly there are certain types of calculations like prime factoring it can be very fast at. 

Any integer can be displayed as the product of various prime numbers, for instance 15 can be factored into 3 x 5. 

105 can be broken down to 3 x 5 x 7, and so on. 

I could pick a bunch of prime numbers and multiply them all together pretty quickly to produce some huge number, but it would take far longer for someone to take every prime number smaller than that number and try to factor it, as you go through all the possible combinations. 

It is not very hard to produce a number that even the biggest classic computer could not prime factor in less time than the lifespan of the Universe. 

But the quantum computer can try each combination randomly, and also simultaneously, and pop out the answer almost right away. 

We use something like that for a lot of our encryption methods, because a system which can theoretically be broken but would require every computer we have to work at it for trillions of years is seen as safe enough, and this is why people talk a lot about quantum computers foiling all encryption methods. 

That’s not exactly true but it can beat that encryption method so you have to use a different one that’s safe against it. 

Quantum computers capable of doing that are a long way off. 

Quantum computers are also not magic wands, they do have limitations and right now tons of them, because it is very hard to keep tons of atoms entangled with each other. 

And you want to be very careful extrapolating amazing abilities off the human in a room example I gave because that was just for conceptual purposes, as I mentioned there are a lot of problems using that. 

Even if you could set up the person in a box and realistically you can’t. 

But even if you could get that to work you can’t just take someone, toss them in that box and tell them to only leave if they figure out the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. 

You have to create a scenario where the correct answer is the mostly likely state for you to observe, and preferably so much more likely that the odds of observing a wrong one are nearly zero. 

I mentioned factoring a moment ago and gave the example of 3 x 5 = 15, it was a huge deal a few years back when they managed to build a quantum computer that was able to do that simple factorization. 

Less mentioned was that they ran it thousands of times and it got the right answer 48% of the time, and Shor’s Algorithm – the one used for quantum factoring – holds that it’s only going to get it right about half the time anyway. 

It was a huge technological accomplishment and we’ve done better since, but it is important to keep in mind how far this technology has to go before its useful even for niche applications, and the main school of thought is that there will always be tons of applications that classical computers remain better at. 

I don’t want to oversimplify it but in a nutshell what quantum computers are good for is searching for needles in a haystack, pattern matching, and the kinds of problems that involve a lot of trial and error. 

And for all that the bits are atoms or photons, the devices will tend to be bigger per qubit than a traditional computer’s bit, because trying to keep a tons of atoms in entangled to each other is a bit of nightmare, and it is frankly amazing they’ve gotten up to 2000 qubits. 

It would be very easy to shrug and assume Moore’s Law will apply to quantum computers too but we’ve talked before about the flaws to that kind of thinking and I won’t repeat them now. 

It may well be that Quantum Computers with billions of qubits will emerge 40 or 50 years down the road, as such Moore’s Law doubling would imply, but we could easily bottleneck. 

When you start thinking about technology inevitably progressing on timetables you’re not doing science anymore, quite the opposite really. 

But we have no idea how big we will be able to make these and how long that will take, nor all the applications it might have. 

Plenty of people predicted enormous computers capable of billions of operations back when we were at this stage of classical computing, but we all know modern personal computing and the internet is nothing like what they were predicting. 

We all know what most people use the internet for and I’m pretty sure Alan Turing never expected us to use computers to exchange pictures of cats with bad spelling and grammar pining away for cheeseburgers. 

So we don’t know all the applications we will have for Quantum Computers as they get better, but we can expect to find plenty of applications for them besides the one’s we’ve thought of so far. 

It’s just too soon to tell and they are very promising technology, at the same time they’re not without their limitations. 

Hopefully you’ve got a clearer picture of how they work now and are in a good position to explore the topic in more depth. 

I always hate to say Quantum Computing is overhyped because it genuinely is groundbreaking technology with revolutionary uses, but at the same time it’s a topic cluttered with bad and superficial explanations. 

Hopefully I didn’t just do the same and they make a bit more sense now. 

Okay, next week we will be returning to the Upward Bond series to look at Skyhooks, devices able to help lift spacecraft into orbit. 

The week after that we will be looking at how you stay alive in space in an episode on Life Support, and we will clarify a lot of concepts and misconceptions about that which we see in science fiction, like the notion of life support being switched off and everyone instantly clutching their throats gasping for air or shivering from freezing cold.

Upward Bound: Space Elevators
---
  
2017-03-09  
https://youtu.be/dc8_AuzeYKE  

---

The biggest danger of space elevators isn’t the risk of them falling down, it is the risk of homicidal insanity from sharing the trip with others for hours while listening to elevator music. 

So today we are looking at Space Elevators, a concept sufficiently well-known it needs little introduction but one which at same time is plagued with misconceptions. 

Our goal is to dispel those misconceptions and look at the concept in detail. 

As part of our continuing look at systems for getting into space cheaper, easier, and safer we will also discuss some of the safety and cost issues associated with space elevators. 

Space Elevators hit the public eye in a big way in the last decade or two but it is actually a pretty old idea. 

It got new life breathed into it with the discovery of certain super-strong materials in the last couple decades. 

The concept itself it pretty straight forward. 

If we built a very tall tower on the equator, one that reached up 22,000 miles or 36,000 kilometers above the ground, you could step off the top and not fall down. 

At that altitude the top of the tower is moving at the same speed as what is needed to orbit the Earth at that height. 

Just above the Earth a stable orbit is just a couple hours, and way out at the moon it is a whole month, at the point where an orbit takes a day the ground stays directly below, since it also turns once a day. 

That is why we call orbits at that height geostationary. 

Now this is only true right above the equator and in a circular orbit. 

You can have a 24-hour circular orbit at an angle, but it won’t stay over the same spot on the ground, though it will pass over the same points each day at the same time. 

That is called a geosynchronous orbit, as it is still synchronized to the Earth’s spin but not stationary relative to the ground. 

If you watched such a satellite from the ground it would seem to bob north and south each day. 

You can also have an elliptical geocentric orbit, which would appear to trace a figure-8 in the sky each day and if it were tilted off the equator one of those lobes would be bigger than the other. 

So a geostationary orbit is specifically a circular orbit directly over the equator, which means any space elevator we want to build needs to be above the equator, though we will discuss a few tricks to getting around this later on, so that your elevator station down on the ground doesn’t have to be at the equator. 

But the basic space elevator is simply that, a long rope or tether hung down from geostationary orbit. 

You could also build a tower up to that height, which was the original concept. 

This idea goes all the way back to the late 19th century, if not before, but at the time they were thinking of supertall buildings, and at that time the word skyscraper was just entering the lexicon and buildings were being constructed now that finally took the title for tallest building away from the Great Pyramid, which held the number one slot for five thousand years, barring a brief upset by the Lincoln Cathedral till its tower collapsed. 

Now, millennia later, we were routinely building taller. 

So it isn’t much of surprise that folks were considering even taller buildings not just scraping the sky but stretching far above it into the heavens. 

We’ve contemplated that notion all the way back to the Tower of Babel, but the advantage of structural steel was now letting us build tall much cheaper and safer. 

On the other hand orbital mechanics have been known for many centuries. 

Folks didn’t think much about putting people into space then not because they didn’t understand orbits, but because we didn’t understand rockets and had no computers. 

You really need both to get an object into a stable orbit. 

Now there is no material that can handle the kinds of stress involved with building a tower that high, or a rope that long, not straight up and as wide at top and bottom. 

That’s an important point for later on though because until structural steel replaced load-bearing masonry, building tall was quite trick unless you went the route the pyramids did, which was to have very little interior space and just build much wider at the bottom. 

That pyramid never collapsed not because its engineers were such geniuses, though they probably were the best in the world at that time, but rather because it is almost entirely one big solid heap of stone that is wider at its base then at its peak. 

Such an object works on compressive strength, how good a material is at being compressed, such as by stone being piled on top of it. 

When each layer is wider than the one above. 

it spreads that compression out, letting you go taller. 

Mountains, for instance, do not require much skill at engineering. 

So a cone or pyramid can be taller than a cylinder or rectangle made of the same material. 

Hypothetically there is no limit as to how tall you can build, if you can keep making the base wider, but obviously when you live on a spherical planet there are some limits in that regard. 

For a given material you can only build a column of it so tall before it collapse under its own weight, and by making the base wider than the top you can increase this limit. 

The same applies to ropes, only they are stretched rather than compressed. 

How much tension they can handle before snapping is based on their tensile strength. 

We will discuss this more in a bit since that is what matters for modern space elevator concepts, but for the moment it is important to note that you can go longer by making it wider at the top then the bottom. 

Tapering it just like a pyramid or cone, only upside down. 

Now building something tens of thousands of kilometers tall when the tallest building wasn’t yet a kilometer tall and the tallest mountain isn’t even ten tall seemed pretty ludicrous. 

However, the opposite idea, relying on tensile rather than compressive strength, wasn’t even on the table till we discovered certain super-strong materials in recent years. 

Ideas for building such a tower usually relied on a concept called active support which we will discuss in detail in future episodes but briefly is the idea that just as you can float a sheet of paper over a floor vent, you could float a platform up by bouncing things off the bottom, thus allowing even taller towers. 

The advantage of such a tower or tether though is obvious. 

Unlike a rocket, where you need to carry all your fuel with you, on such a tower you can run a power cable up it from a reactor on the ground, or solar panels in space, to supply energy to whatever is climbing the tower, presumably an elevator though in practice it might better be thought of as a train. 

And you can gain power when things are going down instead of up, so you are spending virtually no energy climbing up the tether and can get a lot of it back on the way down, losing some energy to transferring that power between the one going down and the one up. 

Needless to say we have discovered some materials that have far higher tensile strength than anything we had back in the 19th century. 

Kevlar and Zylon far surpass steel cables in tensile strength, and carbon nanotubes and graphene far surpass them. 

Now any given material has what is called a breaking length or self-support length. 

This is how long that can be before it would snap under its own weight. 

For instance if we were standing on cliff 2 kilometers up with a spool of rope that had a breaking length of 1 kilometer, once we unspooled more than kilometer of it off the cliffside it would snap even though no one was climbing it. 

A good nylon rope can have a breaking length of several kilometers, and some metals can be a hundred kilometers or more and Kevlar and Zylon can do a few times better. 

But carbon nanotubes appear to be good to 5000 kilometers or more. 

Now here is where the first big misconception comes in that causes many flawed objections to space elevators. 

Our elevator needs to be 36,000 kilometers high, so if carbon nanotubes can only do 5000, we’d seem to have a problem, 5000 is a lot less than 36,000 and we need more than too because we want to carry material up it. 

But there’s two problems with this objection. 

First, as I mentioned, you can extend length by tapering your tether to be wider at the top then the bottom. 

And second, breaking length is how long something can be when hanging in Earth’s Gravity. 

It’s higher on Mars, for instance, where the gravity is lower, and even higher on the Moon. 

Of course we’re not on the Moon or Mars, we are on Earth, but the cable is not. 

Or at least most of it is not. 

The higher up you go the weaker Earth’s gravity is. 

For instance, up at 5000 kilometers above Earth, which has a radius of 6400 kilometers, gravity has dropped to just a under a third of what it is here on the ground, and the breaking length of a material is three times longer there, since everything weighs only a third of what it does down here. 

Out at geostationary orbit gravity is only a couple percent of what it is here and breaking lengths are almost 50 times longer. 

Second, we have the ability to taper the tether, making it wider at the top, which lets it hold up a longer length. 

So it doesn’t matter if something’s breaking length is lower than the distance to geostationary orbit, because by making it wider at the top than the bottom, by giving it a high taper ratio, we can increase that breaking length and it is further increased as gravity weakens from getting further from the planet. 

Hypothetically any substance can be used for a space elevator with a high enough taper ratio, but as before when we were building up taller objects with wider bases this does have a practical limit. 

Now actually mass manufacturing something that’s operating at its maximum tensile strength, and essentially has few or no flaws, is another matter. 

Very expensive. 

Especially since you either need to fly it up there or build it up there and spool it down, and getting stuff into space is incredibly expensive. 

I mean that’s the whole reason we want to build this thing. 

The usual notion is that you would actually build it here. 

You’d start with a thin wire, as thin as you could make it, again wider at top then bottom but still very thin, and fly that up. 

That first one doesn’t necessarily need to be able to handle double its weight, if you can either manufacture the next cable up there from material brought up in smaller bits or join sections without creating a weakness. 

These are massive things too. 

Even a thin string weighing a gram per meter on average would mass out at 36,000 kilograms, and probably couldn’t carry anything like that much mass as cargo. 

That’s a bit more than the Space Shuttle was designed to get into low orbit, and we need to go all the way to geostationary, so it would be either a very large launch or we’d have to find a way to join sections of tether together without introducing a weakness in it at the joins. 

They also don’t have to be circular tethers like rope, a ribbon would work fine too or other shapes, though you have to worry about wind on these things. 

There are a lot of forces acting on these besides just straight down gravity that can potentially cause some problems. 

Now you can build bigger, but by and large it makes more sense to build more of them instead. 

Better five or six cables right next to each other than one bigger cable of equal strength, and better another elevator elsewhere, servicing another region, than to just have a single elevator at some point on the equator. 

This raises two other points though. 

Having cables at places other than the equator and where the top of the cable actually is, because it isn’t at geostationary. 

We should cover that first. 

The tether doesn’t end at geostationary orbit, it has to go at least a bit further up, either ending in a massive terminus station just above that or a very long length of cable. 

Left to itself an object at geostationary doesn't fall, but any point beneath that would, and it is generating weight pulling the spot at geostationary. 

You need an equal force pulling upward, and past geostationary the tether is pulling outward, as those segments are now moving faster than orbital speeds for that height. 

A tether running out, say, another 17,000 kilometers, which would make it 60,000 kilometers from the center of the Earth, would be moving about 4.4 kilometers per second, while orbital speed there is just 2.4, so you’ve got an extra 2 kilometers a second of free speed to launch into interplanetary space with That counterweight doesn’t have to be more tether running off for thousands of more kilometers, it could just be a big space station right over geostationary. 

It’s all about making sure the total force up and down at geostationary cancels out, this is sometimes inaccurately called the center of mass, but that’s not quite right in a non-uniform gravitational field. 

Anyway that station can be quite massive, even with tethers running higher up, because anything you build just a bit down and adjacent to it, also at geostationary, is going to float right there of its own accord, and you just connect to it. 

You could construct some fairly huge space stations there, more than big enough to make artificial spin-gravity viable. 

That also means you can ferry up huge amounts of material for whatever you are doing up there. 

Fuel for ships, solar panels for power, and all the building material and equipment you want, though it still costs money to make such things and carry them up. 

It is still fairly expensive but down to the point that the equipment and salaries for those there will be the bigger chunk of your budget. 

So you could have huge stations with industry and drydocks and hotels up there, all given artificial gravity by spinning them. 

Now by default you build your space elevators on the equator, probably on a floating platform in the sea. 

Geostationary is limited to a ring around the equator after all. 

This means that while space elevators are pretty awesome they would seem to limit you to having all your spaceports at the equator, whereas most of the nations with robust space programs are way north of the Equator, and they’d rather have their space ports near their cities. 

This is fixable though if your cables are decently stronger than the absolute minimum strength needed. 

Because again it is only the terminus station that needs to be above the equator, or rather the center of force of the tether. 

Now if we stuck one end of the tether at geostationary and the other down in, say, New York, we have a problem, the station is going to be pulled north and then go all out of orbit with problems to follow. 

But if we stuck another tether on the opposite side of the equator, say down in Santiago in Chile, that slightly off-center force of being a few thousand kilometers north and 36,000 kilometers up would be counterbalanced. 

Just like guy wires holding up a tower, only without the tower. 

You’d want to use at least three, more works too, and they don’t need to form an equilateral triangle or anything. 

You’d probably also want to have winches at top and bottom of the tethers to help keep the tension right for each and tweak that tension if it starts to drift. 

You can also stick one of these right in the middle of a city, unlike airports or some of the other designs where they either have a big footprint on the ground or are so loud they make a plane sound quiet. 

These would be quite quiet. 

Not much visual effect either, such cables would be virtually invisible from any serious distance and while the pods climbing them would be bigger and probably have navigational lights on them, you’d otherwise have to be quite close to see the tether. 

I often have folks worry that some of these launch assist systems will ruin the night sky but no more than airplanes or satellites or skyscrapers. 

Of course people also worry about them breaking and wrecking their city, or the planet. 

We might as well talk about that then. 

Can such a tether break? 

Yes of course, they can. 

I mean the stuff they are made out of is as tough as diamond but it’s not going to survive intentional sabotage of someone setting off a shaped charge or something on it. 

It is not easy though, you could chop at one with an axe all day long, stopping only to replace your broken axe heads, without accomplishing all that much. 

But yes one can be damaged. 

Where it breaks is what actually matters but first let’s crush this idea it would cause mass carnage. 

One popular portrayal is that the broken tether would wrap around the equator flattening everything in site. 

That’s very exaggerated, there’s not much reason to build these things individually thicker than an arm, if even that, just add more in parallel if you need them, and they are not crashing into the ground at hypersonic velocities. 

These are not thick cables, probably no thicker in most cases then a large electrical wire on a trunk line, and they won’t hit going much faster than one of those would if it fell, air will slow them. 

They’ll either burn up if the fell from high enough or slow to normal speeds before hitting, and very low speeds if they are ribbon shaped rather than cylindrical. 

So yeah, don’t stand underneath one or it will hurt or kill you, but you could also see it falling anyway. 

We also have a device for slowing things in air called the parachute, and while we don’t want to add a lot of static weight to our elevator by installing parachutes at certain intervals, what makes a parachute heavy is the material it is made out of. 

Parachute threads and ropes have to be very strong, in terms of tensile strength. 

Conveniently if you are building space elevators you have the ability manufacture superlight materials with huge amounts of tensile strength. 

So you get much lighter parachutes and you could place them at intervals with charges designed to sever the cable into smaller bits. 

So they wouldn’t do much damage falling in the first place, but with some parachutes on them this can be further minimized. 

Another important factor is where it breaks, and if it is anywhere inside our own atmosphere the cable is going to ripple up like a cut thread toward the station and then fall back down and dangle just over the atmosphere. 

You go in and repair it, and in practice you probably have a couple hundred kilometers of extra line up at the terminus station and can just lower it back to the ground station. 

The ten or twenty kilometers in the atmosphere will just fall down, straight down. 

I wouldn’t want to be in that station when it happened, but you’d probably have gantries and scaffolding around the base anyway. 

A decently sturdy roof should survive it and again parachutes are an option. 

So a lot depends on where the cut occurs. 

The problem is that orbital speeds around Earth get lower as you get further away, but on our tether, it gets faster the higher up you are. 

Up at geostationary the tether is moving at exactly the orbital speed for that height. 

Just a bit above it, at the Terminus station, the orbital speed is a bit lower but the station is actually moving a bit faster. 

If you cut the tether below that the station would drift off to a higher orbit and would need to have some thrusters on it to instead drop to geostationary while repairs were underway, then boost back up. 

It might need to cut free the tether higher up too, the one whipping ships into interplanetary space. 

As to the tether, once cut, its individual bits are moving too slow for orbit, orbital speed is higher than up at geostationary but the tether below that isn’t even moving at that speed. 

So it will fall down. 

This is where the notion of it wrapping around the planet comes from, it is still moving faster than the equator, they have the same angular velocity but not linear velocity, same as the equator is faster than the polar regions. 

The higher up, the faster it is moving, so it will fall and wrap around the equator. 

But as we saw, it isn’t ground damage and casualties we have to worry about, rather it is the folks on the tether. 

What happens to the people on the elevator when it snaps? 

We also have to consider what would happen if the climber falls off the cable for some reason. 

For the folks above 23,000 kilometers, they’re okay, they’ll fall gaining momentum and actually enter an elliptical orbit around the planet. 

Anything with lateral speed relative to a massive object will enter an orbit around it, it’s just that if that is too elliptical that orbital path will pass through the planet. 

Since those pods have to be airtight the people on them will be fine, so long as the air doesn’t run out, until someone can retrieve them. 

They’d have many hours if not days to be rescued, probably by shuttles from the Terminus station. 

We will talk about how you keep folks alive in such a pod or any other spaceship in a few weeks in an Episode appropriately called Life Support, because there’s a lot of misconceptions about that too. 

For the folks below 23,000 kilometers things are actually a bit easier. 

They won’t go into orbit, since the planet is in the way, but if your pods are built for reentry and have parachutes on them they should be fine. 

I mean for a given value of fine. 

I’m pretty sure crashing thousands of kilometers down to the planet in a passenger car full of dozens of other terrified people is going to leave some serious psychological trauma even if physical injuries don’t occur. 

And that is long fall too, dropping from halfway up that tether is going to take a few hours. 

Gravity is weaker there so you aren’t accelerating as much at first. 

There’s a lot of things that could go wrong on that fall for people to worry about, and a lot of time for them to worry, so I am not going to try to minimize how awful those hours of falling will be even if you do survive. 

When the cable snaps most pods won’t initially notice anything, if you have a string suspended from the ceiling holding a weight and cut that string, the string above the cut is going to snap upwards but that isn’t instantaneous. 

It seems like it to us because the string is short but on a long cable it will take quite a while for the wave to travel up the tether. 

This thing is thousands of kilometers long, so even if the wave is moving several kilometers a second it could be some minutes before your pod bucks. 

Plenty of time for the control station to notice the break and send the command to the pod to break off, some detonating bolts probably. 

A little bit of speed is handy too since you do not want to get lashed by a diamond hard cable whipping upwards like a rubber band, so giving yourself a few meters a second of delta-v is probably a good idea. 

So I don’t want to trivialize the dangers and risks, but they stack up pretty good compared to trains, planes, and automobiles. 

Our normal methods of traveling around the planet. 

Speaking of that, these elevators are pretty good for that kind of travel too, not just getting up to geosynchronous orbit. 

You can jump off part way up and do a controlled fall to some other part of the planet, again you are moving too slow for orbit so you could jump off a tether from Los Angeles and fall to New York, ride up a bit higher and fall to London or Madrid. 

You’d want wings and thrusters for control and maneuvering but it’s a pretty fast and cheap method of travel around the planet. 

This is even easier if you are doing the multi-tether option, where several ground stations run up to a single terminus station, especially if those cables are meeting part way up. 

You could have an airport up there, assuming your tethers are strong enough to handle that kind of weight. 

If they are you can also consider running tethers sideways between two tethers. 

Which would be faster than riding all the way up to the terminus station then down another tether, or taking a shuttle from that terminus station to another tether. 

You could also drop off those lateral tethers too, an option also available to us when we look at certain launch loops later in the series. 

But that’s a key point, these elevators are handy for more than just space travel. 

We should probably talk about speed on one of these elevators. 

That will depend a lot on how much power you have to spend, but the default trip is many hours. 

There are some tricks using some of the other systems we will look at in future episodes, essentially hybrid versions, that could make the trip faster, like shooting down a vacuum tube first and up a space tower that was also in a vacuum around that elevator to let you build up speed without air getting in your way. 

If you could pull off one gee of acceleration the whole way there, flipping midway through to decelerate, your trip would take an hour, faster than actually falling since again gravity is weaker up there. 

But even pulling 3 or 4 gees on the trip is only going to cut that trip time in half. 

Going that fast is rather energy wasteful but convenience is often worth that and it would also change your fall dynamics. 

Okay, let’s talk cost. 

We obviously have to be pretty vague here. 

At the moment graphene, our presumed elevator material, costs about $100 a gram. 

That’s more than double the price of gold and remember our thread-thin starter tether massed about a kilogram per kilometer, or 36,000 kilograms, or 36 million grams, or 3.6 billion dollars. 

The launch costs for getting that up there are in that neighborhood too. 

A tether as thick as a pencil or finger would mass out at more like a 100 kilograms a kilometer, or 360 billion dollars, with similar costs for transport. 

That’s why it’s important to start with the small tether first, so you can take advantage of the cheaper launch cost that tether will provide for subsequent ones. 

Now we expect the cost of graphene to get a lot cheaper as we get into mass production of it, it’s just carbon, preferably made of graphite which is more like a buck per kilogram, not a hundred bucks per gram. 

The real issue is making a single cable as one complete unflawed or mostly unflawed thing. 

And more importantly of doing that up in space. 

Once you get that first small tether up it might be strong enough to hold another tether of equal mass, but more likely it will only be able to hold a fraction of its own weight, so you bring up shipments of the stock material in small amounts along the starter tether and manufacture up there. 

Your first Terminus Station is going to basically be a big tether manufactory. 

I’ve seen cost estimates as low as 6 billion and as high as 40 billion, and I’ve seen even higher plus I’m a pretty conservative person where such estimates are concerned so I tend to automatically double them, but that’s a very affordable cost even if we take the high end one of 40 billion and double it. 

Even pessimistically it drops the cost per kilogram of material moved to space to about $100, whereas it cost several thousand dollars a kilogram right now. 

So those savings stack up pretty quick especially if you are increasing the amount of stuff you are sending into space. 

Which you would be too. 

If you build it they will come, because there’s all sorts of scientific, commercial, and industrial applications to space we don’t use right now because of the cost to transport things to and from space. 

Lots of folks would pay five figures for a vacation up there and you could haul whole film crews up there for months at a time to film a science fiction movie or TV series in actual zero-gravity for a change. 

So why haven’t we built one? 

Well first off the cost. 

To break even on such a thing, which will surely have maintenance costs too, you need to be transporting a lot more up into space than we do now. 

Second and most important, of course, we can’t actually build one just yet. 

We don’t mass produce graphene and certainly not as big long cables. 

We need a while to get to that kind of production scale and then we’ll need to take kilometer long chunks of it and stretch it and see what its actual tensile strength is in real terms, not just on paper. 

It works on paper but so do a lot of things that later fall apart in practical design. 

When we get to that point we can start coming up with specific designs and better estimates. 

And it might turn out to be impossible. 

As mentioned earlier, graphene’s breaking length is a lot shorter than the necessary cable length, tapering, having it wider up top, and the diminishing gravity as you get higher, might be enough, but it will be close and when we start making cables out of the stuff the real-world breaking length of those might not be viable. 

On the other hand we might find something even better than graphene or carbon nanotubes. 

So space elevators aren’t guaranteed, at least not for Earth, they work just fine on anything with less gravity like Mars or the Moon, but they are promising and something we could easily see even twenty years from now. 

Too soon to say, but there’s lot of room for optimism. 

It is also not our only option on the table, as we will see with sky hooks in two weeks even much shorter tethers can help a lot with getting into space, but as a I mentioned near the beginning this idea predates super-strong tensile materials. 

We can build tall towers instead, exact same dynamics only it requires an alternative to tensile strength, something we call active support, which we talk about in another episode too, and which opens just as many interesting doors as super-tensile materials. 

And we’ll be looking at a lot of those in the upcoming episodes. 

Next week though we will be looking at Quantum Computers, a topic that like Space Elevators has a lot of misconceptions about it, showing a lot of promise and also a lot of hype. 

We’ll clear away the noise next week. 

After that we will return to this series for a look at Skyhooks, then we’ll segue the week after that to discuss not getting into space but staying alive when you’re up there.

Upward Bound: Getting Into Space
---
  
2017-03-02  
https://youtu.be/JgxkilF5XUM  

---

Space is so big it makes Earth look like a tiny pale blue dot, but the hardest part of exploring space is simply getting above the thin layer of air around that dot What we’re going to be doing in the future episodes of this series is taking a more in-depth look at a lot of the launch assist systems that hold promise for making space travel cheaper and easier in the future. 

Way back when the channel was in its infancy I did some quick episodes covering many of these but not with the sort of depth I tend to favor these days. 

The time seemed right to revisit these topics in proper detail, with each of those concepts getting their own episode, but I thought we’d begin with discussing some of the basics and giving each a quick overview. 

So that’s what we’re going to do today. 

Each subsequent episode will be designed to be a standalone one, able to be watched without having seen any of the others first, or even without this episode. 

But today’s episode, besides giving an overview of those, is essentially about clearing up a lot of the misconceptions about getting off the planet. 

Something I avoided even in the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium, where I mostly focused on more high tech options to modern propulsion, particularly things like the Ion Drive which is only useful once you are already up in space. 

The hard part is getting up into space in the first place, something we’ve already succeeded at. 

Now many would wonder why if that’s the hard part we seem to have stalled out in space exploration. 

The simple answer is two-fold. 

First, we haven’t stalled out, we’ve made tons of progress in the half century since the Space Race, but it does seem a lot slower. 

Second, and it’s the reason for that slow down, is that we have pretty close to maximized what we can do with rockets, and those require huge amounts of resources to deliver just a small package to orbit. 

Ultimately you are constrained by the rocket fuel, you typically need 20 times as much fuel to get into orbit as the mass of the ship and cargo being put in orbit. 

That’s all chemistry and we’ve basically maxed out what that allows. 

The amusing thing about it is that if we could teleport a fully fueled rocket from the launch pad into orbit, that rocket would contain nearly enough fuel to get pretty much anywhere in the solar system. 

Currently to get such a rocket into space would require dozens of trips into orbit first. 

Even then such a ship would still be quite slow. 

But up in space, with ships designed solely for space, we can use alternatives like Ion Drives, which are far more efficient in space but useless for getting into space. 

Now the important thing to understand is that when we say orbit, we don’t mean just height. 

Height is the easy part. 

First you claw your way up through the atmosphere then with the air out of the way you start picking up the lateral speed needed to get into orbit. 

Otherwise you’d just fall back down again. 

Ignoring air resistance for the moment, to get up into the Low Earth Orbit zone, defined as beginning at 100 miles or 160 kilometers up, simply requires an upward speed of about 1800 meters per second, or Mach 5. 

Fast but not nearly fast enough for orbit, it is only about a fifth of the speed necessary and only a tiny fraction of the energy and fuel necessary. 

Without that speed to get into orbit itself, you’d get up there and just fall right back down again. 

This is where all the technical terms start getting in the way. 

A rocket consists of fuel and the tank that fuel is in, and those are pretty heavy too, so we tend to build multiple tanks and discard the empty ones. 

For that matter certain fuels and rocket designs are better for that initial ascent then for in space so the rockets tend to have multiple stages. 

Typically 2 or 3. 

If you had a magic rocket casing that weighs virtually nothing you’d probably just use one. 

Instead we drop that first stage tank, the booster rocket, right into the ocean. 

This is why launch sites are typically by the ocean, and the reason why they tend to be on the east coast is because the Earth spins that direction. 

You can launch the opposite direction too, what is called a retrograde orbit, but this uses more fuel because instead of using the Earth’s spin to give you a nice boost up to orbital speeds, you’ve got to fight that spin first instead. 

You could also launch from the North Pole for instance and gain neither advantage or disadvantage. 

Many folks wonder why we don’t launch from on top of mountains, and indeed those would offer some benefit, but it’s fairly minimal and it’s quite a hassle to base from up there. 

The Russian Cosmodrome is an example of spaceport that’s pretty far from population and industry, it has to be since they need a sparsely populated area for their boosters to come falling down. 

You pick your location based on all the available factors and being near the equator, or on the west coast of an ocean, or up high are all advantageous but not necessary. 

Trying to build on top of a Mountain just isn’t deemed worth the effort, though Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador is right on the Equator and while only the 18th tallest mountain, in terms of sea level, its peak is the furthest point from the center of the Earth. 

The Equator bulges out a bit compared to the poles because of the same spin that would assist us in launching rockets. 

So it’s a better launch site than even Mount Everest if transportation were not an issue and you didn’t need to worry about boosters crashing down on people. 

While some booster rockets have parachutes built into them so they don’t actually smash into the ground at terminal velocity, in general only the ones landing in the ocean are recoverable for reuse. 

Even then the necessary retrieval and repair costs are significant, which is part of the reason there is interest in reusable rockets. 

Now those boosters falling, on parachutes or not, is an issue. 

When we talk about serious exploration and exploitation of space we are not talking about doing one launch per week, or even a couple a day. 

Real space development needs to be involving moving thousands of people back and forth from space every single day and preferably from places near major cities. 

Ideally we want to be able to have a spaceport at just about every major metropolis, like we do airports. 

Having boosters land all over the place and near inhabited areas isn’t viable. 

Even if there wasn’t a risk from boosters falling down, because they were one stage rockets, the sheer noise of any sort of rocket launch is so loud that it makes an airport or train station sound quiet, and folks aren't too happy about having those near their homes either. 

While having launch sites far from inhabited areas is not prohibitive to space travel, we will be looking at some options for getting into space that do not require large and loud rockets, some of which would allow direct access to space directly from cities without being a hazard or nuisance. 

But let me emphasize this point. 

This series is not about getting a few more space launches or getting them a bit cheaper or safer. 

We are interested in ways that let us start getting people and material into space at frequencies and costs not much higher than flying to another continent. 

That is our goal, because that is what allows us to build actual spaceships, ones that spend all their time in space, and aren’t confined by the design limitations of having to claw their way up through an atmosphere or survive a fall into one. 

That’s why we won’t be focusing too much on stuff like reusable rockets and modern initiatives like Space-X, though we will also look at the rocket issue and the huge advantages of reusable rockets, both in terms of their advantages in the here and now and in terms of their uses in spaceflight where sometimes a rocket is going to be helpful. 

The stuff we will be looking at is also expensive, and I mean compared to rockets, which aren’t exactly cheap. 

A common question I got when I did the original short videos on some of these items was if we had the technology, why we were not using it? 

And the answer is that for many of them we do have the technology but even ignoring all the prototyping and developing, such things are only worth it if you are doing hundreds of launches a day. 

They are ‘all in’ strategies’, where you might spend a hundred billion dollars just to build the launch site, and you might spend quite a bit more in prototyping. 

So even though they make individual launches a lot cheaper, they only actually make it cheaper if you are launching so often that all the R&amp;D and construction is less than the amount you’d otherwise spend shooting stuff into space. 

In the upcoming videos we will always take some time to discuss how close we are to the necessary technology, how much it might cost to build, in loose terms, the cost per launch, and the safety issues. 

So to get into space you have to get above the atmosphere where the drag would not slow things down and make them fall down, and you need to get up to a phenomenal speed that makes the fastest aircraft look like snail. 

That’s the trick and we have a lot of approaches. 

We will survey those now. 

The first and most obvious is to build a giant tower into space, like the Tower of Babel. 

The problem here is, besides the construction issues, that you will be turning around the planet once every twenty four hours. 

If we built a tower 100 miles or 160 kilometers tall, stretching up to the bottom of the Low Earth Orbit Zone, things will be very different from what most people expect. 

First, you wouldn’t float around. 

Things like the space station don’t lack gravity because they are far from Earth, the gravity they experience is only a few percent lower there. 

They are just in a state of freefall where their centrifugal force cancels out the gravitational pull they feel. 

On the equator, even on a tower a hundred miles tall, our centrifugal inertial force outward away from Earth is pretty miniscule, not even enough to decrease our weight by one percent, let alone cancel it out completely. 

In a natural orbit the two exactly cancel out, so to speak. 

So if you stepped off the side of this tower, up in Low Earth Orbit, you’d fall down, unlike stepping out an airlock on the space station where you’d remain in orbit because you still have that speed, and you’d still feel weightless even though Earth is yanking on you nearly as hard as it is right this second here on the ground. 

You would not, incidentally, burn up on reentry by stepping off the tower. 

Reentry is rough because of the speed you are moving at, and since slowing down would cost a huge amount of fuel, we prefer to let the atmosphere break our speed instead. 

If you fell off the tower you would get quite fast during the fall, hitting hypersonic speeds, but as the atmosphere got thicker you’d begin slowing and eventually hit normal terminal velocity for the thicker atmosphere below and you could pull a parachute and land on the ground. 

Of course you’d need a pressure suit. 

It would take you a few minutes to fall into the areas that the atmosphere was thick enough to cause real drag and not be causing you to suffer vacuum exposure. 

That’s an important point though because some of the structures we will discuss, like the Orbital Ring or Lofstrom Launch Loop just hover in the sky high above where the air causes much drag, and folks wonder about it tumbling out of the sky and smashing things when it hits. 

In practice such things would not cause much damage even if they landed unaided, but you’d put parachutes on them and separation charges to break the things into smaller pieces. 

You wouldn’t want to be under one when it landed, but it's like a bridge falling down, only it is unlikely to land in traffic and has a long descent time, nobody should be under it when it lands, you can even put those charges on it to push it so that it doesn’t land on a city even if it is right over one, and even the folks on it would have a good chance to survive by just grabbing a parachute and leaping out an airlock during that last minute of descent. 

They might even survive the actual crash if they were inside it. 

This is one of my irritations with space elevators in fiction. 

I’ve seen a lot of authors, even some with strong science backgrounds who should know better, refer to a snapped space elevator coming down like it was mini-apocalypse. 

I’ll explain in detail why it is no such thing in the episode on space elevators, but the reasoning for that, and for any of these other constructs we will discuss, is the same. 

They are not crashing in at re-entry speed. 

Some of them probably wouldn’t even kill you if they landed on your house. 

But the issue, besides construction, with this sort of tower is that if you do step off the side you are not in orbit, you fall down. 

Now the upside is that on top of one you do have a little bit less gravity to fight and you also have no air to fight, and that is still a pretty big deal. 

You could launch a rocket a bit cheaper from one of those. 

But more importantly you could build two or more towers and have a runway, where something accelerated you up to orbital speed, like a magnetic rail line. 

And that option definitely has some fuel advantages, as you could be gaining speed not from on board fuel but electric cables connected to a stationary reactor powering the track. 

This is why levitation methods don’t tend to interest us too much for ships though. 

Floating up on a balloon or some magnetic levitation platform just gets you high up where the air is thinner, it doesn’t help that much. 

Nonetheless it does help enough that we will see variations on it in future episodes. 

The other thing is the tower’s top is moving faster than the equator is, and the Earth’s spin does help a lot with getting into space, the higher up you are, the faster you are spinning even though you are staying in the same spot relative to the ground, so the bigger the boost, also the higher you are, the slower your orbital speed. 

Unfortunately the Earth’s is 4000 miles or 6400 kilometers in radius so being up a couple hundred more doesn’t help much. 

It does help though, just a little bit. 

The Classic Space Elevator circumvents this. 

It takes you high up in space all the way to geostationary orbit where the orbital speeds are a lot less, only about 3 kilometers a second, not the 7.8 of Low Earth Orbit, and we call it geostationary because that’s the orbit where you hover over the same spot on the ground. 

Which means a building built that tall would have the top moving at orbital speed. 

And if you stepped off here, you would not fall down. 

You would also be weightless, because while the Earth’s gravity is still decently strong, just a couple percent of what it is at the surface, the spin of the tower is now creating a centrifugal force that cancels that out. 

So a tower built all the way up into geostationary orbit would be one where you could step off and float there. 

If you built it a bit higher and stepped off you’d start floating away rather than dropping, incidentally. 

Needless to say a tower 36,000 kilometers high is not something we can easily build, but such a device is called a space elevator and was designed back in 1895 by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who is essentially the grandfather of spaceflight, and on top of giving us the rocket equation he came up with a ton of different approaches to get into space, including the elevator, which at the time was designed as just a very tall building. 

You can’t build something that tall with normal materials but we actually have several different approaches to making something that big. 

The more modern notion of an elevator, a long tether hanging down from orbit and relying on tensile strength, has come to be viewed exclusively as a space elevator, whereas ones that only partially hang down, either from geostationary or lower, have come to be known as skyhooks. 

Actual buildings that tall tend to be called Space Towers or Space Fountains, the latter because they use streams of particles to hold themselves aloft. 

We will get to all of those in turn in future episodes, along with options for floating up on balloons or having runways held aloft above the main atmosphere by balloons, or towers held up by being made of balloons, or runways held aloft, like the Lofstrom Loop or the Orbital Ring, by streams of matter. 

We still have some entirely different approaches though. 

First is that instead of using rockets to get up to speed you use a long runway down here on the ground. 

However to do this properly you need a tunnel, preferably one evacuated of air, for the thing to race along and when it does shoot out, it still slam right into the air anyway, essentially undergoing re-entry right here on the ground. 

To get around that problem you often have it ascend a ramp to exit on top of a mountain where the air is thinner or even higher up. 

This is the idea behind concepts like Star Tram, and various other mass drivers that are essentially giant rail guns. 

It’s also a lot like the Hyperloop, a type of vacuum train popularized by Elon Musk. 

Instead of burning rocket fuel and dropping booster tanks you get up to speed using some electrically powered system, using magnetics, or up to enough speed that you can do the rest with more modest rockets. 

The next option is better rockets. 

And we still can improve chemical rockets in many ways but what we usually mean is nuclear ones. 

Needless to say there are some safety issues with this but I am going to give them their own episode because they can be used decently safely in an atmosphere and in the past I’ve only ever discussed their use in space, which uses a different design. 

Now lastly we have hybrids of these, which would work to the strengths of multiple systems. 

Sometimes hybrids aren’t advantageous because of all the extra effort and mass of multiple systems, but they’re very appealing for spacecraft where we might, for instance, have a long ramp that exited out dozens of kilometers above the ground at the top of a space tower and then used some rocket fuel to match speeds with a low hanging, rotating skyhook. 

That hybrid scenario by the way, is the one I would deem best for if we needed to get a lot of material into space and couldn’t expect any significant new scientific breakthroughs. 

Major breakthroughs might change that equation, which could include advantages from Economy of Scale. 

On the other hand the grand-daddy of getting material up into space cheaply is the Orbital Ring, or rather several of them built at different heights and angles, in that it rivals or surpasses the space elevator in terms of usefulness but does not require any materials that are arguably impossible to make, whereas this object is more of feat of engineering than science. 

We’ll get to them all in turn, some episodes will be longer than others and we might occasionally combine two decently related topics, especially where I feel like I’d need to explain the basic science over again for both, but I want to close out by saying not what this series is about, but what it isn’t about. 

It’s not about fringe science concepts where ships shaped like saucers will magically rise into space on anti-gravity or magnetic thrusters, though we will use a lot of magnetic levitation where we can. 

I don’t do conspiracy stuff on this channel, either for or against, not my cup of tea to buy into such theories or spend my time poking fun or ranting at those who do. 

We stick to the realms of known science here, not because we think we know all of science but because that’s what we’ve got, and speculating about unknown theories we might one day discover has always struck me as counterproductive. 

Some of the things we will discuss are so immense in scale they might make the blood drain out of the face of any engineer, but they will rely only on known science and nothing else. 

We will also always take as a given that we want to get into space in a big and bold way. 

Not everyone feels that way and we’ve discussed before some good reasons why you might not want to do this, but this series is focused on ways of getting huge amounts of people and cargo into space in a way that is a lot more affordable and safe than now. 

That’s our goal for this series and hopefully it will be a fun trip. 

Next week will continue that trip by looking at the best known option, Space Elevators, and we will hack away a lot of the misconceptions that have grown up around these in recent years.

Interstellar Highways

One of the more irritating problems about space travel is that if you want to get up to decent speeds you need to burn huge amounts of fuel. Not just the fuel to get the ship up to speed, but the fuel to get the rest of the fuel up to speed. It is a losing battle, even if you have the sorts of super-fuels like fusion or anti-matter. 

Way back at the end of the first year of the channel I mentioned an alternative to it, and also one that can hypothetically be done without any new science at all, even fusion, something I normally take for granted whenever discussing anything involving travel to other solar systems. We covered it rather hastily so I thought it was time to look at it in more detail. The strange thing about a lot of the earliest episodes is that I often covered the most practical options in those, in abridged form, then covered less practical options in more detail in later episodes. It seemed a good time to correct that. The funny thing is it doesn’t sound terribly practical, building a highway between stars, and of course we’re not talking about a literal highway, that’s simply an analogy, and in some ways a river might have been a more apt one since we’ll essentially be talking about sailing between stars using actual sails on rivers of light. I’ve noticed the idea of propelling spaceships with lasers has been getting some coverage in the press of late and I should probably explain how that works and why it is an attractive option first. The big down side of rockets is that you have to carry all your fuel with you and that your final speed is strongly controlled by how fast your exhaust flies out the back. 

If you want to go as fast as your exhaust flies out, you need 63% of your ship to be fuel, and if you want to slow down at the end you need to be 86% fuel. To get to double that speed and back down again you need to be 98% fuel, and for triple 99.75% fuel. 

What that actual speed is depends on what your fuel is. If it were just compressed gas that’s quite slow, like if you were an astronaut who lost anchorage and started spinning away from your ship. You could vent your air tanks in one direction and the rocket equation works just fine, your propellant is leaving at about the speed of sound, about 300 meters per second. 

Of course you’re mostly not fuel, or air, but if you were 63% fuel by mass you could get up to about the speed of sound, ignoring obviously that there’s no sound in space. 

Our typical rocket fuels have exhaust velocities 10-20 times higher than that, meaning they could get to that same speed of sound with the ship only being a small fraction fuel, about 5-10%. As you’d imagine you want the highest exhaust velocity possible with a rocket because it’s pretty much impossible to get to more than 4 or 5 times your exhaust velocity with any rocket, again getting to just triple the speed and back down again required 99.75% fuel ratio, or 400 parts fuel for every 1 part of ship and cargo. It gets even worse to get to 4 or 5 times that speed. So your ideal exhaust is photons or neutrinos or gravitons, things already moving at or near the speed of light, which is a million time faster than sound. A rocket that shoots light, or photons, out of the back is called a photon rocket, and you can build one at home as easily as you can one that operates using baking soda and vinegar. You just need a flashlight, and indeed if you turned a flashlight on and tossed it out an airlock it would begin accelerating off… but very, very slowly. 

A flashlight with two D-Cell batteries in it might be able to emit 90,000 Joules of light before dying, and as we know from Einstein’s E=mc², 90,000 Joules is the equivalent of one trillionth of kilogram’s mass energy, or one nanogram. 

So it’s great rocket fuel in terms of mass, though not terribly practical. If I had a box made of perfect mirrors that let me dump light in and it couldn’t escape until I wanted it too, then a box with a kilogram of light in it, and yes photons do have mass in this context, which I then handed to an astronaut who weighed 100 kilograms including his suit, could use that 1 kilogram box of light to get up to about 1% of light speed. 

We can’t box light up like that, but if we could it would be a great fuel, and that’s basically what makes anti-matter or Kugelblitz black holes so ideal. However they still have to obey the rocket equation and of course rely on science we don’t have yet, and maybe never will. However we can actually make a better ship than those using just modern technology, and we do that by chucking the rocket equation out the window and just not having the ship carry fuel at all. 

Hit something with light and it reflects or absorbs that light. Photons it absorbs transfer all their momentum to it, photons it reflects transfer twice their momentum to it. This is how a solar sail works, but if you want any real speed and mass you need to concentrate that light either with lenses or by using a laser. Especially as you get further from the sun. The force a laser exerts on a non-reflective object is just the power of the beam divided by the speed of light, double that if it is reflective. So if I want to exert a force of one gee, the equivalent of earth gravity, on a 1 kilogram object, or about 10 Newtons, I need about 1.5 gigawatts. Which is about the power output of the Hoover Dam. That might sound rather outrageous but when dealing with interstellar travel it will turn out to be cheaper than the alternatives and it means nothing inside a fusion economy or solar powered Dyson Swarm or Kardashev-2 economy. 

Thinking of it terms of hydrogen, and rounding down to assume low efficiency of fusion and laser generation, a 1.5 gigawatt laser would run through about a kilogram of hydrogen each day. Hydrogen again is the most abundant stuff in the Universe, so that while this is in some ways and insanely wasteful use of energy you could run a trillion of these lasers for a trillion years without even putting a noticeable dent in Jupiter. And again we were assuming we were only getting about .1% of the mass energy of that hydrogen turned into a laser beam. This is the idea behind Starshot, you lug some solar panels and a laser up into space and push a tiny probe with solar sails on it with that laser. Here’s where we get problems though. First, it is not easy to keep a laser targeted on an object when it starts getting far away. 

It needs to stay on course quite precisely or the laser misses, and it is quite easy to get a tiny variation in speed. Your mirror for instance does not have to bounce light straight backwards, even a miniscule change of angle on that mirror will bounce the beam off at that angle and give you a little lateral velocity. This is actually handy since it means ships can move other than just away from the beam. But even a tiny drift of a millimeter a second means an hour later your ship is 3.6 meters off to one side, and your laser flies past if your sails aren’t at least that wide. If your laser is light-hours away it won’t even know its missing you for hours and it will take just as long before the laser is back on target. Second, lasers beams are not infinite thin cylinders, they do spread out. For both those reasons the further you get from the laser, the bigger the sail you want to have. So you want your sail as thin as possible, preferably less than a micrometer thick, but we have a lot of problems going much thinner than that. Third, you need some way to slow down. Now you can just use the laser to get up to speed and fuel to slow down, which is handy, but still not ideal. Nonetheless you will always want two things on any laser-sail ship. First, a very good GPS system, it helps to be able to calculate your position quite exactly and tell the laser where you are and where you will be whenever that message gets to them and the laser gets to you. Second, you always want some fuel to maneuver with on board, because it means you can correct your position if you lose lock with that laser. The reserve air on your ship might do the job. Of course an obvious way to slow down presents itself, you have a laser on the other end that does the job, pushing back against you. 

Needless to say, something has to go build that first. 

Also, you probably have a maximum range you can realistically keep pushing at, where it just isn’t viable to keep the laser on the sail or expand the sail further, so you probably want spots along the way that can pick up the job. Space Stations between stars with their own lasers who can push on the ship to speed it up more or push back to slow it down. It’s as simple as that. We’ll walkthrough a fairly realistic case of this in a moment but that’s the basic idea, so let’s do a few notes before that example. First is power supply. Near the Sun obviously solar power is handy, no clouds or nighttime in space. It’s always noon. You can beam power directly out to your distant relay stations, easier to keep a lock on something that isn’t really moving much and can be quite large compared to a ship. But by preference you’d have local power generation, if you had fusion. If you did you wouldn’t use this for interplanetary travel because even the crappiest fusion reactor is going to let you let get very high interplanetary speeds with a lot less hassle than lasers involve. Hydrogen, again, is the most abundant stuff in the Universe and if they’re offering an exhaust velocity of hundreds or thousands of times what chemical rockets offer they’d just tend to be easier to work with. 

Either way, getting the power out there is a hassle but it’s a doable hassle. 

Second, laser beams diverge over distance and the maximums allowed relate to wavelength, so blue light is better than red light, and ultraviolet is better than blue, whereas microwaves are worse by far than any of those. I mention this because you can use any type of photon you can reflect. Lower frequencies have other advantages though, since you need fairly sturdy mirrors to reflect ultraviolet light whereas you can reflect or absorb microwaves with a metal mesh. That’s why your typical microwave door is plastic with a mesh in it. The holes in that mesh are smaller than the microwave wavelength and keep it from getting through, thus allowing you to watch your food cook without your eyeballs exploding, which tends to ruin dinner. I should also not that you can bounce a beam back and forth several times and gain momentum each bounce, so when you are near a laser you can get more push than you’d expect. Of course beams tend not to stay together after many bounces and that’s hard to do at a distance. 

You also don’t have to use light at all, charged particles flying out of a particle accelerator and hitting a magnetic sail would work, so too would neutrinos if someone were ever to figure out a way to make a substance that could reflect them. 

You can also use that beam as your power source. You just have solar panels on the back not just mirrors. Absorbing the light to use it for power only gives you half the push reflecting does, but considering the beams need to have the power of the Hoover Dam to push a kilogram as hard as gravity does, you obviously don’t need most of that, so you sip in a little and reflect most. Also as a note, while I’ll be ignoring relativity when talking about speeds, to save the headaches, this still cannot be used to reach or exceed the speed of light. As you get up to those speeds, not only do you have to worry about all the travel hazards we discussed a couple weeks back in the Interstellar Travel Challenges episode, but your laser pushing on you is going to start red-shifting, meaning it is getting weaker. You start getting up close to light speed you’ll be wondering why your nice big 200 gigawatt blue laser now appears to be a weak red 100 gigawatt laser, and if you keep going, why it is now a measly 1 megawatt microwave beam. 

Lastly before we get to our fictional example, I want to emphasize that this method is superior not because it saves energy. It does but who cares? Again Hydrogen is super-abundant. It beats out chemical rockets in all respects but beats out fusion and even anti-matter or black hole starships in terms of maximum velocity. It lets you get faster on less energy, but it lets you get faster in general. It’s maximum speed, on a long enough chain, like one running across an entire galaxy, is whatever velocity that local chunk of space will allow before all the drag of the interstellar medium finally cancels out your acceleration from your increasingly weaker and red-shifted beam. But if you have relays all along the way helping to clear out dangerous debris and pushing you along, 99% of light speed is doable with such a laser highway, even higher if for some reason you need to slow down your onboard time enough to justify such a thing. Out in the intergalactic void where things are even thinner and where trips would take million of years, I could see justifying the power expense to push your speed up to ultra-relativistic speeds, so the trip only took a thousand years of your time even though you still arrived millions of years later. And yes you could scale this system up to stretch between galaxies. Okay, onto our example. We’ve covered the science put I’ve been finding a hypothetical fictional example often helps cement the idea, I’ll return us to the one we used for the Life in a Space Colony Trilogy but we’re back home at Earth. It’s the year 2500 and mankind has a couple dozen or so interstellar colonies and has settled thousands of asteroids in our own system. The population in the solar system is a few trillion, and they’ve got fusion power and are slowly adding rotating habitats to a Dyson swarm that so far is cobweb thin, not blocking even 1% of 1% of the sun’s light. Very little of the solar system’s GDP is going into interstellar flight, we’ll say 1% of 1%, the equivalent of 2 billion dollars a year from the current US economy. But they’re so much bigger and higher tech than us that such an expenditure still means they are building and equipping dozens of fusion-powered colony ships a few kilometers long and sending them out every year. Those ships only travel at a maximum of 20% of light speed so even though they’re spewing out massive arkships they’ve only got a couple dozen colonies that have actually arrived and sent home ‘mission accomplished’ messages. Most are still en route, the ones that arrived all date back to when you only built maybe one ship a year. Of course some of those messages are saying ‘Hey, send more people’ and others are saying ‘Hey, we’ve got some people who want to come home.’ So we go talk to the giant supercomputer named Deep Thought sprawling over Mountview, California at the former Headquarters Quarters of Google and we ask it if Faster Than Light Travel might be on the table. It says yes, it probably is, but it will need some time to think about it. We decide to go get lunch while the God-machine figures it out and the TV reports as breaking news that Deep Thought has gone into very deep thoughts and says it will be busy for the next seven and a half million years because some unidentified morons asked it to solve faster than light travel. 

So none of the other AI’s will talk to us and the various cyborged up transhumans also tell us to take a hike, if they want to visit another solar system they’ll just send a digital copy of their own brain by radio at light speed. So we decide we’re going to have to do this using fairly basic technology. At the dawn of the 26th century you don’t get to play with human-level intelligence AI’s or independent self-replicating machines if you don’t get one of those to sign off on it. Not since ‘the Incident’ that resulted in unhinged Grey Goo turning the Mars’s Moon Phobos into quadrillions of paper clips. 

So we can’t send out any pencil-sized tubes of self-replicating machines to impact into various interstellar rocks and turn them into entirely automated laser platforms. We are going to have to build it all ourselves. And our relays are going to have to be manned and when we talk to our engineering team they tell us the real issue is making our relays close enough that they can clear out all the space junk. If we want ships slamming along at 90% of light speed we need to have a big corridor millions of kilometers wide that we are constantly clearing of anything big enough to be visible to the naked eye. 

They also say they’ve got a great sail design made out of graphene that’s a hundred kilometers across and can reflect our lasers at up to 10 megawatts per square meter without melting. 

And a whole sail like that will only mass 1000 tons, and they can target that easily a whole light week away. They say we can drop fifty stations spread out over a light year and they can keep a laser on a sail like that the whole way and keep those corridors clear of debris and space dust so that they can do those speeds and that the corridor is wide enough that millions of ships could be passing by at different speeds or in the opposite directions without collision concerns. So we get them to design us a ship with some spare sail segments, a small fusion reactor and some fuel for maneuvering, and all that and the main hull will cost us 3000 tons. We are going to go with a nice 10,000 ton ship design, 10 million kilograms. We could go bigger and slower, we could go smaller, with smaller sails, but we are building to 10 million kilograms, the mass of modern Ticonderoga naval cruiser, very small by this channels standards. I think our interstellar arkship example, Unity, had shuttles bigger than that. This time around our ship isn’t a big long cylinder or even a sharpened pencil, whose front cone shape helps bounce debris away, but is an outright cone. We are going fast, we want all the bounce we can get, and we are accelerating fast too, so we don’t really need spin gravity, or at least if we do, we need a cone shape to let us merge that with the acceleration-gravity the beam is providing. 

We don’t have any massive artificial habitats that can’t be easily moved around. There’s some hydroponics and a few small gardens, but this is a passenger ship, not some huge colonial arkship. We’re also high tech so if the ship’s shape isn’t ideal halfway through the trip because we can’t accelerate anymore it will just stretch itself into a cylinder. It’s the sort of ship where a thousand people could enjoy modestly comfortable personal cabins comparable to modern luxury cruise ships. You could pack more folks in but this is still a journey of many years and living space isn’t really a big constraint, mass is, so it’s not about cramped cabins, more that the furniture is light-weight stuff. 

Our spare sail and fuel are packed up front acting as shielding for the trip along with all our spare air and water and supplies. The neat thing about our relay is that if something happens to us we could adjust speeds enough that some other ship behind us could come up and take us on board. Indeed the relays might even be able to send us accelerated matter streams of oxygen or hydrogen if we needed them. 

So how about those stations and their lasers? First let’s talk power. If our 10 million kilogram ships are going to be getting pushed along at one-gee, those lasers need to be 10 million times more powerful than the 1.5 gigawatt one we discussed for shoving a one-kilogram object. That’s 15 million gigawatts or 15 petawatts. So you know, the light hitting Earth from the sun is only a bit over ten times that, so we’re talking about lasers that could provide noon-time sunlight to an entire continent. They’re also burning through 10 million kilograms of hydrogen a day, using our earlier figure. 

They could be getting that from home, and endless chain of massive freighters coming in slower stretching back to Jupiter. But interstellar space is lousy with giant icebergs so each station is probably built on one dragged at lower speeds to be on the chain. Or it sends out swarms of smaller ships to mine its local area, after all it has a whole light week, a volume much bigger than our solar system, all to itself. There’s a huge amount of hydrogen gas floating around there and it could just have collectors out past the corridor that sucked up hydrogen to be shot to that relay. 

But a single tanker the size of modern oil tanker could dock every few months to replenish their needs. You could slap speed limits on your highway if fuel consumption got to be an issue but even one small gas giant could fuel hundreds of these lines for longer than most stars live without being significantly reduced in mass. You might even use a slower matter stream down the corridor to supply fuel, you don’t just move ships with such a highway, you can move atomic matter via particle accelerators and information too, since even modest lasers running between each relay can allow huge bandwidth transmissions with little signal loss. So fifty relays a light year, and we will say we’ve got a total of 2000 light years worth of relays going to all our neighboring stars inside about 20 light years, there’s a bit over a hundred of them, giving us a decently round number of 100,000 relays, with a few hundred on each line on average. 

What are the relays like? Ships aren’t really stopping at these places often. There’s a sweetspot between fusion engines and laser-sails probably somewhere in between 10-20% of light speed, so you might have slower ships just above that which stop from time to time, one-gee of acceleration or deceleration will let you get up to or down from 10% of light speed in just over a month, or down from 20% in about two and half months, so slower economy style ships, as it were, making slower trips might make layovers at them. They also might be fairly busy local ports for mining activity. In terms of size they can be quite huge if they want to be, again they’re running lasers strong enough to light a continent so if they were only running them at night they could be that big, lasering ships in their night cycle and using that juice during the day. These are non-moving objects, so they don’t really need the kind of shielding the ships do. They also aren’t going to be one big laser, more like an array of thousands of them, and so they could be a small swarm or string of rotating habitats serving as a home to a billion souls. Or they could be quite small, just a station of a few hundred for maintenance and maybe using their excess power for lighting large forest preserves or such. The other neat thing about a system like this is you can have shuttles. You need a big ship to ferry normal humans around for a decade, and again cyborgs or AI’s can probably skip the whole thing in favor of traveling as data so we might as well think normal humans. So you need a big ship for the whole journey but not for jumping around. A single person pod or small ship for maybe a dozen with a big sail could take a lot more than one-gee of acceleration, so people could rendezvous with a ship or station by boarding such a shuttle and getting pushed up to or down from speed. The equivalent of a life pod might be some barebones life support with a big sail designed for the maximum acceleration possible. 

As to constructing such a chain, you could build the relays by normal means or by using existing lasers to get out the next location and slow down more conventionally, saving a lot of fuel. Once built they allow near-light speed travel from system to system. 

On a scifi note it actually allows piracy, since folks could lurk in bases near the trail and come out and pirate ships and data. Those outposts are devastatingly heavily armed with the megalaser but that’s only a good weapon at relatively close ranges since people can intentionally jink their ships around to avoid it, as we discussed in the Space warfare episode. 

Okay, we’ll leave off there for today. Those are interstellar highways, a means of travel that requires no high technology but allow the best performance of any interstellar option currently allowed under known physics, even some that seriously bend it. 

I’d like to thank Stefan Blandin for making some of the excellent animations for this episode. I’m always grateful whenever anyway submits artwork for the channel to use but this kind of custom-tailored animation is the sort of thing that can take hours and even days to make and I really appreciate that. There are obviously no animations to use for something like this when even laser sails are still a pretty new idea let alone some massive network like the one discussed today. 

Next week we will be beginning our new series, Upward Bound, where we will come home to Earth in modern times and look at various launch assist systems that might let us get into space cheaply enough to start setting up the kind of interplanetary infrastructure you need to have before you could ever contemplate something like the Interstellar highway.

On deciphering the language of the aliens of Bellicosity 3, our linguists assured us they didn’t even have a word for war. 

Unfortunately for our embassy, it turned out they had 50 different words for various types of war. 

So today we continue our discussion of hypothetical alien civilizations by taking a look at how we might go about deciphering their language. 

We looked at this very quickly in the first contact episode last month but we didn’t get into the nuts and bolts much, and today we will explore it a bit more in depth. 

To do that we will take two approaches. 

First we will contemplate how we might decipher our own language if we were them, and then we will look at some of the stranger ways aliens might communicate that have been proposed. 

What we will see is that this is not an easy thing, but that it should be possible. 

Folks contemplating alien language tend to either oversimplify it and assume it is a lot like our own, often assuming it resembles English more than most other human languages do that don’t share that linguistic ancestry, or say it is going to be totally indecipherable. 

The former is obviously wrong but the latter probably is too. 

I’ll give an example of indecipherable reasoning. 

You would say that me gesturing at my chest and saying Isaac tells most humans that is my name, but as far as an alien is concerned I might be saying I am hungry or this is my territory or pointing at my shirt to tell you what color it is, or even “look at my shirt, isn’t it awesome?” The problem with assuming aliens are incredibly alien is that people tend to take it too far while still assuming things. 

They throw their hands up at such examples because they think that I could be referring to a hundreds things, which I could be, but that isn’t the problem. 

The mistake in the logic chain by the way is that the alien even realizes I am pointing at myself. 

If it isn’t a two-legged, two armed critter like ourselves it has no special reason to assume my gesture means anything at all from a communication standpoint. 

I am crooking my arm at myself, that’s great, I might be bending one leg too because my left foot is sore and I’m favoring my right. 

That obviously indicates something, I have a sore foot, but it is linguistically irrelevant. 

If the alien figures out that you pointing at your chest means something, you’re already halfway victorious in your communication battle. 

You’ve established you are trying to communicate and two of the ways you do that, gesturing and speaking. 

And it doesn’t matter a hill of beans if the alien doesn’t know that me pointing at my chest means I’m telling it my name. 

If it has any concept for the idea of a name in the first place, that will be on its list of things it thinks I might have said. 

If it doesn’t, then that will be one of the big question marks on the giant matrix of matching up that will be done. 

We will have shared concepts, probably not all but many will exist for both of us. 

Complete translation may be impossible but a working translation of most concepts should be. 

Both species probably have a word for star, water, air, clouds, numbers, distance, time, food, waste and so on. 

One or both parties is going to have access to massive computers and teams of experts who are going to be correlating everything and trying every iteration till they hit matches, even partial matches. 

There are going to be big differences, things that just won’t meaningfully translate, but there will be a ton of overlap too. 

This will be particularly difficult if none of their senses used for communication at least partially match up to our own, if they don’t use vision or sound at all for communication but just radio waves, but that should match up to sound enough to be analogous for comprehension. 

Now some would argue that you can’t learn a language completely or even enough to grasp part of it if limited to just sound, for instance, like if you were locked up in a room and your captors spoke a foreign language and you could hear them but not see them. 

You don’t know if one guard is saying good morning to the other or telling him shirt is dirty or commiserating that his dog has died. 

You’ll pick up some stuff but others will elude you because you have no context. 

You can’t see his shirt. 

Now there is some truth to this but it is also wrong, and more so with radio signals. 

We will ignore for the moment that we emit more than just audio, that we also emit TV signals, because the first thing aliens should hear from us is radio-only. 

Both signals travel at the same speed and we began sending the one many years before the other. 

Aliens would have many years of audio-only before they got our first TV signals. 

Now the flaw here in assuming you can’t learn the language by listening to it is that it simply is not considering what you can do with some creativity, a large enough sample of data, and tools like frequency analysis. 

Frequency of patterns in the data, not the frequency of the radio signal. 

This is very like the basic tools of simple cryptography. 

If I am given an encrypted book I know is in English and that each letter has been swapped with one specific letter, an A is a J and a D is Q for instance, I can crack that code very quickly. 

I know the two most common three letter word in English tends to be ‘The’ followed by ‘And’, so whichever three letter combinations occurs the most is probably The, and then And, and from this I now know 6 of the 26 letters. 

Simply by observing the frequency of an expected word we are able to find it. 

Consider our guards, odds are good one of the most common words said whenever two of them beginning speaking, when the voices change, is going to be a greeting, and the last word a good-bye. 

When they bring him his meals, odds are good they discuss things relating to food. 

“Take the prisoner his meal”, “Pass me that plate”, “That smells good”, thing like that. 

Now a human by themselves might not be able to figure it out even over years, just from those occasional remarks, but when we are talking about decades of radio signals from dozens of sources at once, being analyzed by experts with all the appropriate tools, the game changes. 

Because a decade of listening to a radio channel will produce nearly a billion words spoken and we have multiple radio channels. 

That is a big sample to work with and far more than most archeologists and linguists have when trying to crack ancient dead languages. 

So we should ask ourselves what almost all radio signals contain? 

First and foremost, the time and day. 

This does not need to be explicitly announced, but the same folks will come on at the same time each day, rapidly telling you that there is some 24 hour long period of significance. 

Even if they come from a tidally locked planet they will know many planets rotate and guess that is the length of ours. 

Incidentally they will be able to deduce this if their equipment is good enough, along with our year length, by the small red and blue shifts of the signals being emitted. 

The speed of the transmitters relative to them is changing based on time of year and day. 

You could even figure out north and south and axial tilt from that, and produce a pretty accurate map of the planet, at least in terms of where people live and what language the people living there speak. 

Regardless they will now know our day length and also rapidly conclude we have a seven day week, that there is a 5 day and 2 day block of some sort of significance, and that the day is broken into 24 hour long periods. 

They will also notice that the word Monday is used a lot on the first day of that 5-day period, Tuesday the next, and so on. 

All just by frequency analysis. 

They will know most of our words for time and date and month and likely our number system too just by that. 

Will it get them the whole language? 

Definitely not. 

There will be some words they probably can’t catch, and for that matter there are tons of words we almost never use. 

But they only need the active language, which is often only 10 or 20 thousand words and they don’t need all of that either. 

Obscure words we don’t use much aren’t necessary, Earth-specific terms like coffee don’t have to be entirely clear to them, and doubtless euphemisms will seriously screw with them even if they have their own, but a good grasp should be possible anyway. 

I looked at some lists of the most commonly used words and picked some at random to try to figure out how someone might figure them out just from a radio signal and two that stuck out to me were ‘he’ and ‘she’, along with his and her. 

How could you possibly figure out gender pronouns just from hearing us, not seeing us? 

Then I went ‘duh’ and remembered that just about every radio announcer is going to use them to reference either a song they are playing or a news soundclip or just to announce who is on for the next hour. 

Loosely speaking men and women have rather noticeably different voices. 

They might not know the specific differences but they will know it has to be significant if Group A and Group B literally have a different word for each other. 

But they might figure those out too. 

For instance they will hear the term cat and dog and used in conjunction with each other and the term pet. 

They should not know much else about them just from that, though they will know they have paws and whiskers and fur and that humans do not, even if they don’t know what those are. 

But as their vocabulary builds up they might figure it out from the occasional detailed reference, like a radio announcer complaining about his dog coming in and leaving muddy paw prints all over the kitchen floor. 

Now they might misunderstand that too. 

They’ve figured out that we keep and prepare food in the kitchen and that we are omnivores and think cats and dogs are a type of livestock, but they’d also wonder why we use tones and expressions and attitudes for them like we do our children. 

So you might have some thinking and arguing cat or dog was a larval form of human and other who thought they were livestock and some thinking we cannibalized our young, but there are so many insistencies with all three ideas that they probably will puzzle out that we have a limited symbiotic relationship with some creatures. 

They will be constantly arguing and revising all sorts of things. 

They will also have a list of their own words they think we probably will have a word for and will be trying to match them up. 

It won’t take them long to match up words like listen, listener, and audience considering how often those words are used on radio, if the aliens have speech and ears themselves. 

They should be able to pick out the words for sunrise and sunset pretty quickly, because they will know the time of our day those words should be more frequently used, which will let them figure out Sun pretty quick. 

They’ll notice breakfast, lunch, and dinner get used at certain times of day the most and get used a lot with words like food and eat and hungry. 

It is a huge puzzle you are fitting the pieces together for where you will have to often move pieces later on. 

Don’t mistake me here, I am definitely not saying accurate translation is easy, just possible. 

Aliens ought to know us first by our audio-only radio, as I mentioned, it will always reach them first with TV signals coming some years later. 

And when those begin arriving I’m sure they will have some surprises. 

“I’ll be damned” One of their linguists will say, “I knew the word duck meant both an animal and action, but I always figured the animal would exhibit some sort of behavior related to that action. 

Which I assumed meant to burrow down into the ground. 

Yet this duck-creature never burrows, in fact it swims, and it can fly, just like the squirrel. 

Heck, I don’t even see any claws on humans for burrowing, they must be retractable. 

Yes, we know they have claws, I keep telling you they have to have them because they constantly say they do. 

Humans are always talking about getting their claws into things.” Now of course any alien listening only to our radio will have a tough time of it, and may find anything like a complete translation impossible until TV arrives a couple decades later, but they will be able to put together a pretty complete language after that. 

We can thank people’s tendency to be pedantic or long-winded at times that they will likely make more progress than we might expect. 

There’s a bit under 10,000 hours in a year, so a dozen or so radio channels broadcasting 24/7 for a decade produces about a million hours of radio, each having about 10,000 words spoken. 

That’s about 10 billion words and odds are some were someone talking about something in excessively boring detail. 

All it takes is one time for someone to say “Our power plants need U-235 not U-238, we have to refine and enrich the uranium we find” and every physicist in the Universe is going to look up from that sharply and say “he’s talking about fission power, uranium is their word for things with 92 protons in it. 

Show me every other word they use more frequently when discussing this and I will probably be able to tell you what it means.” Every specialist field will be able to do that trick, and for that one all that was probably needed was the 235 and 238. 

It’s just frequency analysis, those two numbers getting used in proximity enough times to each other is going to get marked down and when shown to chemist or physicist they will probably trigger that and they’ll be able to say it very likely that is what is being referred to and all the puzzles pieces nearby that will start falling into place and you can expand from there. 

You’ll miss some, mess some up, and some just won’t translate at all, but you will keep widening and refining your picture. 

If they still haven’t cracked most of everything in that first couple decades, then TV arrives and radios get more common and in a couple decades their inventory will contain trillions of words and millions of hours of video. 

Keep in mind, while we do have ancient written languages from the dawn of history we still have not translated, that’s mostly because we maybe have a few thousand words, many of which are scavenged half intact from stuff written or engraved by hand, spanning centuries. 

Words change with time and distance, symbols and letters can even change, and you don’t have much standardization. 

They’d have many, many billions of examples of just one regional dialect from one short time period. 

Of course they first have to figure out what the signal is saying. 

They will notice the pattern almost instantly but figuring out that it is supposed to be turned into an audio signal at certain frequencies and speeds is harder than it sounds like. 

They should know it needs converting, their biologists can tell them how unlikely radio waves are to be used for natural communication even if they don’t use sound to speak themselves. 

But vibrations of air, and the ability to hear that, ought to be a fairly common thing. 

Any place with an atmosphere, which is probably just about every place technological life evolved, is likely to have creatures which make noise when walking around and it definitely helps to have a mechanism for being aware something is bumping into things, even if you’ve got 360 degree vision. 

They also have very good odds of being able to look at our planet once they get the signal and determine the composition of that atmosphere, which tells you a lot about how sounds work there. 

For TV it is actually a bit easier, it gets kind of blindingly obvious what the aspect ratio of the images is supposed to be. 

Those early ones will all be in black and white which is going to help too. 

Though they might get thrown for a bit by assuming we have monochromatic vision. 

When they get the color version they might get thrown again since those are not exactly color, they are three monochromatic images over top each other and the signal hardly says ‘I am the color red, which you would know as a wavelength of as 600 nanohooves.” And it won’t help if they themselves are dichromatic critters, ones who only see two colors which is the case for most mammals, and those happen to be yellow and near-ultraviolet. 

That’s where the scientists do their detective work and start trying to guess from materials in the image and the ambient lighting what frequencies we’re showing. 

Tricky but doable, they will after all know exactly what wavelengths of light our sun produces and probably our atmosphere’s makeup, and if they didn’t they will now. 

They might get a glimpse of a lightbulb and say ‘That’s gotta be Tungsten, we can back calculate the illumination it is giving off and tell you what colors these are’. 

Assuming they have eyeballs of course. 

Without those they might still figures out that it is moving pictures just as a blind person can read brail. 

But we should ask ourselves what senses aliens might have because any communication that doesn’t involve sort of direct link akin to telepathy or being wired together ought to operate using one or more of those. 

And it will tend to be one you can produce a high bandwidth exchange in. 

For instance we can communicate by scents but mostly don’t, even if we could produce a range of smells at will and had the olfactory senses of dogs, this would still be far too low bandwidth to be of much use. 

Scents take time to percolate around, traveling maybe a meter per second, compared to the speed of sound, hundreds of meters per second, or light, which is a million times faster than sound. 

Now I know many of you are now amusing yourself thinking of the most obvious way humans would produce smells on command, but we will bypass that an assume we could only communicate by smell, some especially weird prison setup that passed scents but not sight or sound. 

You could create a code if you had a typical bathroom sink cabinet of various scents. 

Rose oil, lavender, eucalyptus, and some others, we’ll say 36 total, one for each letter and number. 

You could now uncap each one at a time for a few seconds and let it waft to your neighbor to write a sentence, then capping it and letting it clear. 

If everyone has wonderful senses of smell you might be able to get out a word a minute. 

If that’s all you’ve got, you use it, but it isn’t all we got. 

We usually speak 120-180 words a minute. 

And obviously you need air for a sense of smell which means you can smack your hand against something even if you have no vocal cords and produce a Morse code beat. 

And you’d probably be sensitive to a wide range of sounds and able to discriminate those decently, allowing you to use several different sounds so you don’t have to do binary. 

So it is unlikely anyone communicates in smells, for high-speed conversations anyway, obviously many animals use this for prolonged lasting communication, like marking their territory. 

They still bark or meow or such too. 

You could have a written language that used persistent smells that you wrote by making dots of that smell and they ran their noses across to read it, but it probably wouldn’t be their main means of communicating. 

No vision combined with a rough sense of touch could eliminate the option of images, engraved or strictly visual as a persistent, written language. 

They might speak, there is air, but that is hard to use for written words. 

So smell and taste are not good methods of communication, they are both senses we’d expect to see develop a lot but they are low-speed, low-bandwidth, low range. 

Same for touch. 

You need to be touching someone to use that. 

It could be insanely high bandwidth with the right architecture, potentially letting you use someone’s skin like a giant keyboard. 

If you tattooed a keyboard onto your arm for people to push on you could potentially communicate decently quickly that way, especially if you had way higher resolution, thousands of keys as it were, and they had dozens or hundreds of little fingers or tentacles that could be simultaneously pressing many things. 

When phone gets discovered you stick your arm in a tele-type machine that smacks your arm-keyboard. 

The problem is it only works when touching, and good speech should have range. 

Sound isn’t as fast or high resolution as sight but it can go around corners and obstacles, and both a very quick. 

Vibrations move through air fast and faster through a lot of other materials like water, where it moves five times faster than air and often that fast or faster in most minerals and rock. 

Light obviously moves quite quickly. 

The sight of you moving your hand, or the noise of your hand slapping down on something, simply occurs faster than the air moved by your hand like a fan or the smells on it. 

It gets to the destination faster and also clears faster. 

They tend not to linger around interfering with follow up information. 

So while we can imagine using our other senses for communication or people having other senses, we are beginning to see how the Universe pushes you toward using those sights or physical vibrations if you want to talk fast, and you do. 

We have five primary senses, we use 2 of them, sight and sound, for communication because they allow the best range and bandwidth. 

We can use one or both. 

Yet I can communicate by touch, the calming or comforting hand on the shoulder or a hug or a shove, but these don’t offer us the speed and detail the others do, so we don’t use it as our primary means of communication. 

You want to be able to talk almost as fast as you think. 

If you want to develop technology you need to be able to do pass information quickly over distances, but it also isn’t coincidental that most critters on our planet with brains bigger than a grain of sand use sight and sound for communication. 

Those are also both very easy evolutionary adaptation paths too. 

A nerve being sensitive to light or vibration is actually quite simple, converting light into an electric signal or vibration into an electric signal is not a huge jump. 

Indeed, the complex image forming eyeball is thought to have independently evolved around a hundred times, and since the only way you can realistically get dense and complex ecosystems is if they are powered by sunlight and surrounded by some fluid, water, air, etc, these two systems of detection are probably present just about anywhere you’d find a large brain. 

If not both than probably one or the other. 

An alien might communicate electrically or magnetically, we do have creatures on Earth sensitive to magnetics like homing pigeons or able to give off electricity like electric eels. 

That is another sense available that we might see evolve into a pretty high resolution means of perception and possibly communication. 

That might seem a lot like telepathy too, but if you start looking for electric or magnetic signals you’ll see it. 

I am skipping telepathy by the way, its common in fiction but except for where it is referring to something physical like radio signals exchanged between two critters I consider it non-scientific. 

Physics limits us to not many realistic means of communication. 

At least on what you might call the spoken end of things, where you are attempting real time communication with someone who is capable of moving around. 

When it comes to their written language, or the actual way they transmit information with sight or sound, we’ve got a lot of options. 

You might have peacocks who evolve an especially complex fan dance to speak, rippling colors in specific patterns, and while they can communicate with noise too, they have no complex vocal cords so their speech is limited pretty much to ‘look at me so I can speak to you’. 

Sign language is definitely an option, though it also helps to be able to clap your hands to get someone’s attention first. 

A good reminder there that it helps to have a complete language for each sense you use, since sign language lets me talk to people when I don’t want to make noise, something a lot of group predators would want even if they had complex vocal cords, so they don’t alert prey. 

Anything you can manipulate fast can be used for communication, slow things too but you have that bandwidth issue. 

You can’t change smells fast as we pointed out. 

I think I joked in the Fermi Paradox Solutions episode way, way back that an intelligent cloud might think we were communicating with it by growing crops in certain patterns. 

Obviously that can be done but it is very slow and smart creatures are not slow. 

It is fun to contemplate something that is intelligent but thinks in years not seconds, but let’s be realistic here. 

It took us millions of generations to go from the simplest multicellular life to what we are now, and those took billion of generations to get that complex. 

The Universe is only 14 billion years old and even if your planet formed just a few billions years into things, you probably won’t have evolved intelligence yet if your generations take thousands of years each. 

So smart means fast, and we see in our own languages a constant effort to cram more information into a smaller message. 

All those irritating text-messaging short hands are a great modern example. 

We also can say that the language will need to be very versatile. 

I don’t mean conceptually, able to add new concepts as they arise, that too, but rather where and when you can use it. 

We instantly convert to a loud, low bandwidth yell when trying to speak to each other when there’s a lot of ambient sound, like while watching a band play, and tend to make gestures more. 

That’s a simple example, but our written language is not pen and paper, I can make those marks on virtually anything with anything else, and it’s a persistent message. 

Carving a sentence into a cliff face takes a lot of time but you can do it and we can all read it. 

Our peacock-like alien example who communicated by fanning their feathers might develop their persistent language, their writing, as a series of colored stones or leaves arranged in patterns to mimic the language. 

A species that could see in mid-range infrared might communicate by selectively widening or contracting arteries to warm certain parts of their body to make visual patterns, but they couldn’t use that for writing because things would cool down. 

The pointing of writing is to communicate with some across time after all. 

You write things down for people who aren’t there now, or maybe so you can hand it to them so they can remember later. 

So these guys might draw symbols to represent those body heat patterns or they might go for pictographs. 

Or maybe they are hugely radiation resistant because their planet has a ridiculous amount of enriched uranium lying around and that, not the sun, is what fuels life and they mix the stuff up in ink to make warm glowing text that stays warm for centuries from passive fission decay. 

There are a near infinite number of options, but most are not that indecipherable in and of themselves. 

So some alien with a fifty eyeballs communicates by blinking a pattern, you could have an entire language where each word represented one pattern of closed and open eyelids. 

That’s handy but you and I would notice that almost right away, and they should figure out almost right away that you only have two eyes. 

Knowing this they know you either don’t use rapid blinking or you do it very slowly, and they should realize you do it too slowly for it to be an effective means of communication. 

They will then ask what alternates means you have for faster communication and even if they don’t have ears to hear your voice, they will probably learn to lip read you very fast. 

They are, after all, already used to staring at the face region to look for complex patterns. 

When determining an alien communication method you look at its biology and ask what it can quickly and easily do that it can also detect, then try to see patterns in that. 

But they will probably be visual or auditory, maybe electromagnetic, which vision actually is anyway. 

One big thing to remember though is that you probably can never speak an alien tongue, since quite probably they won’t have tongues. 

What you’re probably really going to be doing is teaching each other’s computers to talk to each other. 

Odds are those will be much better at understanding each other. 

If you can teach a computer to speak your language, to actually speak it and hear it, then it should be able to explain that to their computers if theirs can too, and to comprehend what it is saying. 

Obviously those need to be better than the computers we have now. 

But even if their computers use balanced ternary instead of binary, they should be able to talk easier. 

The big concept of course is that you just keep trying things till something clicks and just keep dumping brain power into refining it. 

You will have things in common, they ought to have some word for star, if by some chance they don’t, then maybe they’ve got one circle or square or the number three. 

It won’t ever be easy but it should be doable. 

If they want to understand they probably will, and if they are anything like us they’d probably build up a lot of empathy in the process, and view us in a more favorable light. 

Sometimes language barriers actually help people get along. 

Okay, we will leave off there for today. 

Next week we will be looking at Interstellar Highways. 

Thin connections of lasers or charged particles linking solar systems and allowing fast and cheap travel between them.

Life Extension

One of the weirdest things about radical Life Extension technology is that your great-grandparents might phone you up to ask you to babysit your granduncle for the evening. 

So today’s topic is Life Extension. 

We’ve looked at this in passing before but never actually dug into the details of the technological hurdles to achieving it or what it might mean for civilization. 

Partially because we don’t even have a universally agreed upon definition of aging yet, let alone a consensus view on what causes it. 

It’s difficult to discuss strategies for slowing or eliminating aging when we aren’t even sure who we are targeting for that battle. 

There are dozens of different theories on what causes aging, but the simple reality is that we do not know yet. 

You are probably familiar with what is called the Wear and Tear Theory, which was developed over a century ago and is very simple and easy to understand. 

Basically the notion that the body wears out and that damage to it can accelerate that process. 

It’s remained sort of the default view of aging for the public but has been in disfavor for a long while now. 

As our understanding of cellular biology and DNA improved we began realizing just how amazing they were at self-repair. 

Lots of theories have arisen as successors, but the only one to really gain much notice with the public is the Free Radical Theory of Aging, particularly the subcategory known as Mitochrodrial Free Radical Theory of Aging. 

Free Radicals, mostly superoxides, cause a lot of damage to the body and are considered quite toxic to biological organisms, we even use them in our immune system, but they are also produced by various life-essential processes. 

Mitochondria, the power plants of our cells, produce them and take damage from them. 

And since Mitochrondrial DNA is not so well protected from damage as our own DNA, tucked away safely in the nucleus of the cell, they can take DNA damage from those free radicals. 

They often produce more free radicals when they take damage too, so it becomes a bit of a feedback loop, and the theory says that this is what causes aging, complete with the final decline we often see near the end. 

A large part of the reason anti-oxidants have become a common health supplement is because they are thought to mitigate much of this free radical damage, which again is mostly superoxides. 

This is one of the better theories for Aging but not without its criticisms. 

It’s a handy one for demonstration of longevity though, since if it were true you could send something in that could detect those mitochondria that were overproducing free radicals and kill them, letting the healthy ones multiply and replenish themselves. 

Just like that your lifespan would be massively increased, not by a small increment of a few years but potentially centuries. 

This is the big thing about radical life extension. 

It is not necessarily an incremental approach where the average lifespan increases by a couple years every decade, as we see now as product of many factors decreasing early deaths. 

Nor is it necessarily a slow incremental push to maximum lifespan, often given as about 120 years of age. 

It can, and indeed probably will be, something where almost overnight the human lifespan suddenly leaps to be 3 or 400 years. 

This is arguably effective immortality since if it did that we would have centuries to improve on that before anyone else died, and we would probably have little difficulty funding it and would benefit from centuries of additional science, much of it conducted by folks who have been personally researching it for centuries themselves. 

It’s a little hard to contemplate the sort of expertise someone might have if they’ve spent a few centuries studying a topic. 

Now a couple things. 

First, average lifespan is not increasing because we’ve slowed aging. 

Most if not all of that increase in average lifespan is us getting better at preventing early deaths. 

This is not just medical. 

Technology in general has massively decreased the number of early deaths, and something as simple as airbag technology, or a law requiring seatbelts, can instantly add to average lifespan. 

That is another aspect of today’s topic too, even if you can end aging entirely, what is often called biological immortality, this doesn’t mean people don’t die. 

Accidents, homicides, and suicides would still tend to bring the Grim Reaper by to collect people. 

To use a rounded figure, if we assume about 300,000 deaths a year in the US from causes unrelated to age in anyway, like crashing a car or being shot or shooting yourself, out of population of 300 million, that would mean you had about a .1% chance to die every year. 

Making the median age of death about 700 and the average about 1000. 

About 10% would die before they lived a century and about 10% would survive to age 2300. 

About .6% would make it to age 5000 and about one in every 20,000 people would make it to age 10,000. 

Assuming everybody had that .1% chance to die each year. 

That’s probably high in some ways since we’d expect technology to prevent death from trauma to improve and for us to get better at detecting and treating the mental health issues that drive some folks to homicide or suicide or reckless behavior. 

Regardless though it isn’t true immortality. 

That of course isn’t even on the table in this Universe. 

Entropy eventually wins and there’s no available energy left to keep life going, even the sort of ridiculously efficient and long lived life we discussed in Civilizations at the End of Time. 

Only an infinite Universe offers immortality, and amusingly guarantees it too. 

Over a long enough period of time anything that can happen will happen, including your death, so that on first inspection even an infinite Universe shouldn’t offer immortality, but resurrection, even in the form of someone born trillions of years later who was a copy of you down to every cell and memory, would also occur. 

An infinite Universe, in either space or time or both, is essentially a repeating circle. 

Go far enough ahead and you will find a total reset, same as if you shuffle a deck of cards enough times it will return to its original state, and if you travel far enough in one direction you will eventually encounter some place identical to the home you left. 

Such things are a topic for another time but serve as reminder today that we are not discussing actual immortality, though you will hear me use the term when discussing this topic. 

I don’t always mean biological immortality either, since extending one’s life by uploading it to a computer or copying it to a new body if the old one is destroyed would seem to still count, even if one can argue that those are simply copies, not the original you. 

No, today we are focused on simply either ending aging or delaying it massively. 

Extending the human lifespan for centuries, and doing it in healthy youthful bodies, not cyborgs or withered husks. 

We do not yet have a concrete theory for aging so we can’t discuss those individual technologies, though I will link the SENS Research Foundation’s webpage in the video description and they do explain their own theories and efforts quite well in many animations, videos, talks, and papers. 

I am a fan of that effort so for neutrality’s sake I should note that they can be a bit controversial in some circles. 

Yet we can still contemplate the idea as quite likely, because even if we do not find a nice-easy fix, relatively speaking, we always have the ultimate fall back of nano-machines. 

As we discussed in the self-replicating machines episode, it should be possible to make tiny little machines we could use to repair things all the way down to the molecular or atomic level. 

This is not an ideal fix, flooding the body with trillions of tiny machines, but it would get the job done. 

A human cell, or any cell, can best be thought of as a city unto itself, full of lots of neighborhoods and individual factories, ports, and so on. 

As an analogy to this, an easy fix like being able to kill off damaged Mitochondria is treating the root problem, it is fixing whatever makes your roads and bridges break down faster than they should, like salt or ice damage, maybe a spray coating that prevents such damage, cheap and easy. 

The nano-machine flood approach is like having a virtually inexhaustible pile of money that lets you hire huge numbers of construction workers paid overtime to work at nights repairing those roads so they don’t disrupt day time traffic. 

This can be a brute force technique where they treat the symptoms, though preferably it would be more sophisticated and elegant, treating the underlying causes, but it’s our fallback if we can’t master aging through other means. 

It is also entirely possible we might get those before we get true mastery of biology too, that sort of nanotech is the kind of thing that could be invented any time between tomorrow and a couple centuries from now. 

This isn’t an episode on that though, and you can watch the one on Self-Replicating machines for more details on that topic. 

We also discussed the more biological machinery approach in the Bioforming and Genetailoring episode and the cyborg approach in the Transhumanism episode, if you want to learn more about those options. 

So extending our lifespans does seem on the table for the not-too-distant future. 

I personally think it is pretty likely to happen in our lifetimes, possibly even in the next decade or two though I won’t hold my breath on that. 

So what would that be like? 

How would that alter our civilization? 

I have found it is often easier to discuss these topics if we just pick one of the probable scenarios and go with that, so I present this scenario. 

Tomorrow someone comes by and says they’ve discovered a pill that taken once a year simply eliminates aging, and even slowly reverses it in those already old. 

It has worked on every animal he has tested it on and everything is working so smoothly and as predicted that he cannot stand the idea of waiting for clinical trials. 

From his perspective every year he waits for those would see tens of millions of people die who he could have prevented. 

The technology is also very easy, not something you could whip up in your kitchen but something almost any scientist or engineer would feel comfortable doing even in a lab they rigged up in their garage for a few thousand bucks, and they could churn out pills by the hundreds each day. 

So he releases detailed plans for how to make the stuff, no patent, the risk is on you, use at your own peril. 

He advises starting with the elderly, they need it soonest and there are no guarantees, he’s also a well-respected scientist and he releases everything and his peers say ‘everything looks right but obviously we need to conduct trials’. 

The recipe is everywhere though and by months end Youtube is flooded with videos of people doing a DIY walkthrough of making the stuff and people are trying it at home and already noticing positive effects. 

At this point it’s a firestorm on the news and people are demanding action. 

Nobody is quite sure what that action should be just yet but by God they want some. 

So congress, or whatever parliamentary body or oligarchy or president for life runs your home nation decides it needs a blue ribbon committee to figure out what to do, and you’ve been tapped to sit on that committee, look at the problem and make recommendations. 

What do you do? 

What are the problems society is now facing and what is urgent? 

First thing I would probably do is recommend various scientific institutions release more detailed and proper methods of manufacture, because odds are a lot of the DIY processes are going to include big mistakes that might kill people. 

Garage laboratories not being the height of safety, efficiency, or sophistication. 

The second thing I’d do is probably to tell pharmaceutical companies they could make the stuff and be exempt from any lawsuits except those coming from screwing up the product. 

You’re not covered if the pills are full of mercury but you are if the process turns out to make people into zombies. 

The immortality drug leads to zombie apocalypse seems a pretty popular one in fiction, I remember a failed TV show pilot from the mid-90’s called Island City that did that one. 

We see lots of examples in fiction of how immortality always seems to have some horrible pitfall. 

For our example we will contemplate damaging effects it might have on civilization but bypass any options like it draining away your humanity or making you psychotic or someone having a monopoly on it and using that to coerce obedience or charging an arm and a leg for it. 

None of those have much to do with living longer so do not interest us today. 

And of course people are appearing in front of your committee raising those concerns, but they are also pointing out some other problems we can’t so easily dismiss. 

As well as benefits too. 

One person comes in and says that now that people aren’t dying we are going to be flooded in overpopulation and die off of starvation in a couple years. 

But we look at the global birth rate and see that it isn’t the case at all. 

At the moment 131 Million people are born each year and 55 million die each year, a net increase of 76 million, if we assumed no one died that would mean 131 Million added each year, but we are assuming a .1% death rate from other stuff so it would be 7 million less, or 124 million. 

Either way it would take another 8 years to add a billion people, instead of 13 years. 

Obviously a concern but not an urgent one. 

Also, as Aubrey de Grey once pointed out, while fertility rises with immortality it doesn’t imply a population boom. 

Men can have kids indefinitely, though age lowers fertility, but it would also be expected to delay menopause in women too. 

However while both of those would seem to imply a huge boom in childbirths, it is worth remembering that people tend to have children later and later these days and what often pushes folks to have them is wanting to make sure they can do so before health problems become a concern or they are too old to take care of their kids. 

An awful lot of folks, suddenly given the ability to have kids much later in life, will go for that option. 

And we would not expect a lot of seniors, even restored to the appearance and vigor of their mid-twenties, to suddenly decide they need to have a new set of kids. 

Some certainly will, especially if the reproductive equipment is restored enough that women already past menopause could have an embryo implanted safely, but I don’t think most would rush to do that when they already have grandkids. 

So the overpopulation concern would seem minimal, at least for the short term, nothing to worry about for the near future any more than it already is. 

Those of you have seen the episodes on Arcologies and Ecumenopolises, let alone the bigger megastructures we have discussed, are already familiar with some of the approaches on the table for dealing with that. 

Pensions and Social Security are obviously a big issue too. 

Now in a way that is simple enough, you just tell everyone those are done, if you have youthful vigor restored you are un-retired. 

However there is going to be a lot of complaint about that and not without some legitimacy. 

If you just turned 65 and had your retirement party you are going to feel screwed over after paying huge amounts into various retirement packages and taxes if you get nothing out of it, plus someone who is 80 years old, even restored to youthful vigor, is not too likely to be able to just jump back into the workforce with ease. 

So you are probably going to need to maintain those for a period of time and institute some options for getting people ready to rejoin the workforce and preferably not way back at square one. 

The folks back at square one, just emerging from school to enter the workplace, are also a problem now because there is going to be a big issue with upward mobility. 

People will obviously still leave jobs, but they’re no longer retiring. 

You are not going to get the management slot when Sally retires in two years, you are not inheriting Dad’s business, at least not for several centuries. 

You’re not inheriting his house either. 

When he does die odds are good he will have several thousand descendants kicking around. 

You also now have a de facto gerontocracy. 

That’s a pretty common state of affairs of course, we value experience and the older you get, the more influence and power you tend to acquire too, and the retention of youthful vigor helps. 

I once floated the notion that you might have senators who had been in office for centuries, but imagine athletes who kept getting better every year, gaining experience and skill while not losing their physical edge. 

Imagine if your local sports team had the same quarterback or goalie for a century? 

He’s be awesome at his job, getting better every year. 

Imagine if the team stayed the same for a century? 

How amazingly well coordinated are they likely to be? 

How good is a band or symphony that’s been doing concerts together for 200 years? 

That of course has downsides too, your athletic scholarships would tend to dry up a bit when there is low turnover and no advantage to recruiting from the young, when you’ve got tons of folks who did it as a weekend hobby for decades and are still in perfect shape. 

You’d probably get a resistance to change too, though you would still expect innovation from younger folks trying to make a name for themselves or thinking outside the box. 

It is a potential problem for long-lived societies though, and one reason why expansion growth off Earth would be handy. 

This fortunately is also not an immediate concern. 

We do have some good news too, we would expect a bit of an economic boom. 

Currently in most developed nations we essentially spend the first quarter of our life growing up and the last quarter being retired, and we mostly do our producing in the two middle quarters. 

That’s suddenly changed, with a median lifespan of 700 years you only spend the first 3% of your life as a child and none of it as a retired senior. 

This seriously decreases the economic burden connected to that, and it also means you don’t particularly need a full time job anymore. 

Unless you plan to have kids perpetually and frequently, or are saving up for retirement anyway, to live off your interest and dividends, you wouldn’t need as high an income, probably taxes would go down too. 

Technology itself ought to keep increasing the production per hour of work, and combined with a long lifespan it should tend to make the work day shorter. 

Easier to justify too since you can sell the notion of working less as giving the new and younger generations some place to go. 

If you weren’t a particularly work-centric person or planning for eternal retirement off interest or having kids constantly, your buying habits are going to be shifting too. 

You are now interested in a house that doesn’t need tons of repairs after 20 or 30 years, for instance. 

You are going to be thinking about trying to find a job you enjoy even if it doesn’t pay as well because you have a long, long time to work there. 

Maybe you are going to be thinking about learning a lot of skills you haven’t had time for before, like fixing your own roof so that when you do get the mortgage paid off you don’t need to take out another for repairs. 

It’s kind of mind-boggling to contemplate the degree of expertise someone can acquire working in a field for centuries, but also to consider the sheer amount of different skills folks might acquire who had a jack-of-all-trades approach to life. 

I tend to expect that to be pretty visible to other people too. 

Everybody in a room would look about the same age, as we assess these things now, but I’d imagine people would start picking up on telltale signs someone was 30 or 300. 

Mannerisms, style of dress, or maybe just an air of confidence you’d expect from someone who has a few hundred years of experience under their belt. 

I could imagine people complaining that nobody takes you seriously till you’re over a hundred. 

I could also imagine social taboos about people asking or saying their age. 

You could get some pretty extreme May-December romances too, though I think for context it would be kind of like going on a date and ordering a Sam Adams to drink and your date saying “I always liked him, he was my daughter’s prom date.” It might be kind of hard to relate to someone whose idea of going to the theater did not mean seeing a movie and when she says she saw Shakespeare one time, she is being literal. 

Neither of those, the upward mobility problem or the extreme age gap problem, is an immediate concern for our hypothetical committee either. 

People might live to be a thousand but you’d only have a handful of people over a hundred when that committee was convened, and no one sitting on it is ever going to have a huge problem with that themselves. 

You’d presumably have a lot of people coming before the committee about the ethics of immortality but I honestly don’t see that gaining much traction. 

We have had tons of products that extend life in some fashion, or claim to, and I don’t recall any of them being picketed. 

Nobody goes around saying you shouldn’t take antioxidants even though that is convincingly marketed as an anti-aging supplement, how well it works is debatable of course. 

I don’t see it from religious groups either, beyond many of them already having as part of their tradition some period of time when people lived a lot longer, like Methuselah, I’ve never had anyone tell me it was wrong on religious grounds. 

From my own anecdotal observations, asking friends who are clergy members for instance, they seem to view it with a shrug. 

Everyone will still die, true immortality is not something science can offer and 10 years or 10 billion is nothing compared to Eternity. 

I’m sure you’d see some objecting but I suspect this would mostly just take the form of them choosing not to take the longevity pill themselves. 

I can also imagine a lot of children arguing with their elderly parents to take the bloody things and a lot of folks refusing. 

Which is obviously their right, and you are going to die eventually even if you take them. 

But I deplore when people use the argument that they’d get bored with life. 

I never get the boredom objection to longevity, partially of course because your brain does get filled up, you do overwrite memories especially those you don’t consider important or important anymore. 

I can’t remember my address from 1990, though amusingly I remember my phone number from then. 

I might be biased on that one too, I’ve never been bored with life. 

I’ve been bored in that sitting in a waiting room kind of way, and I’ve changed primary life goals for something I decided was better a few times, but I can’t recall ever disliking let alone getting bored with existence. 

We’ve discussed that notion before and as I said at the time, if you got bored with existence you can always opt to end it, don’t take the pills anymore or pick up a dangerous hobby, as I recall I suggested hunting lions with a nerf bat. 

I don’t particularly approve of big game hunting or harassing wildlife, but I would have to give props to anyone pulled that off or survived bare-knuckle boxing with an actual bear. 

And while you are pestering those critters, they are at least compensated by getting a free meal out of it. 

I’ve given life extension a lot of thought over the years, it’s always seemed like an actual option on the table I might live to see, too much scifi growing up perhaps, but my own motto is ‘live forever or die trying’ and I basically put it at coin flip odds that I might get to live for centuries. 

I’ve never worried about the morality of that or getting bored or inhuman from it. 

I could see wanting to make majors changes to my life every so often, change jobs, change hobbies, move around, that sort of thing. 

I could also see semi-retiring occasionally, like working for a decade at something then just taking a year off to see the sights. 

Personally I like the idea of being able to read volume #100 of a book series or owning a home I’ve lived in for a few hundred years. 

Though that author might get bored writing it, or you might get bored living in that house, I can see boredom with specific things just not boredom with life in general. 

Hate you career as an engineer? 

Go back to college and get a Ph.D. in economics or art history or something. 

Go spend a decade as a beach bum living off your savings or go the opposite route and join a monastery for a few years so that when you leave all the little luxuries you’ve come to take for granted seem like the coolest thing ever again. 

Collect skills so you can be that 300 year old who has friends over for dinner and you can casually remark that you got to be a good cook from that decade you spent as a chef. 

Enjoy the freedom of having the time to do all the things you’ve always wanted to do but didn’t have the time for, because now you do. 

Okay, we will wrap up there for today. 

As is often the case we tried to limit our discussion of the ethics of the technology under discussion, where we did it was mostly to bridge past a lot of the regular bits that are a little worn out and get to less-discussed and more interesting bits. 

As I mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t put money on life extension happening in our lifetimes but I wouldn’t want to bet against it either. 

It is physically possible and there’s been quite an uptick in funding for researching it in recent years. 

We did have to bypass a lot of the specific mechanics, I’m not a biologist and even if I were we’d have had to spend a lot of time stepping through a lot of basic biochemistry first. 

Should you be so inclined though, you can learn more about the mechanics and specific technological challenges by following the link to the SENS Research Foundation in the episode description. 

Next week we will be returning to our discussion of alien civilizations by taking a look at languages. 

We will look over some of the more peculiar ways intelligent organisms might talk to each other and also look at the problems and strategies involved in deciphering a totally foreign language.

Interstellar Travel Challenges
---
  
2017-02-02  
https://youtu.be/s6BQSgidbmc  

---

One of the trickiest things about traveling through the vast vacuum of interstellar space is that it isn’t a vacuum. 

So today we are going to be taking a look at some of the difficulties involved in interstellar spaceflight and some features of spaceships we haven’t discussed before for time constraints. 

We’ve looked at spaceships many times and interstellar colonization too, but today’s topics take some time and were never absolutely vital to the topic at hand. 

Here are those key topics we will be covering today: 1. 

How fast Ships can go 2. 

The Non-Vacuum of Space 3. 

Collisions and Protection 4. 

The Shape of a Ship We will also be rejoining our Gardener Ship, Unity, from the Life in a Space Colony Trilogy, you don’t need to have seen those episodes to follow along with the discussion today but it saves some time to use them, and I’ve grown rather partial to the ship. 

As a reminder, that ship massed in at a couple hundred million tons, was a half a kilometer wide, and a few kilometers long. 

We’ve visually rendered it before but that was always more conceptual then accurate. 

It had a crew of two hundred thousand when it left Earth for the Tau Ceti system, and as it traveled at 10% of light speed it needed 120 years to arrive there. 

They had a lot of people born during the trip, and also enjoyed massively extended lifespans, something we’ll discuss more next week, plus they were receiving constant if delayed tech updates from Earth, and you can make a lot of technological progress in a century. 

All of which meant they had more people when they arrived than originally planned, and the technology to do the job better and with less people. 

Many of the folks had adjusted to thinking of the ship as home and been raised to think of colonizing solar systems as their life purpose, and their worldview probably would have altered to view that as one of the greatest accomplishments a person could labor towards. 

So it was no big surprise they decided to continue their journey onward, planting colonies like seeds in a great big galactic garden on an eternal journey toward the edge of the galaxy and maybe beyond. 

But the ship was not designed for that and again they’ve got a century of technological progress since the ship was built, so they decided to retrofit Unity before leaving Tau Ceti. 

They pick as their next destination 82 G. Eridani, a system around a yellow sun that like Tau Ceti is a bit older, smaller, and dimmer than our own Sun. 

It is more or less in the same direction Tau Ceti is from Earth just a bit further along. 

Tau Ceti is 12 Light years from Earth and 82 G. Eridani is 20, but it’s about 12 light years from Tau Ceti being off at a bit of angle. 

So it will take them as long to get there as their first trip. 

They’d like to do it faster, and not need 120 years to cover 12 light years, the engineers say they can boost the speed to 20% of light speed and a 60 year journey. 

However they are leaving with just a bit over 50,000 people so they still need to repopulate, but you don’t need a century to double or quadruple your population especially when folks are not aging, they don’t die off and they can keep having kids indefinitely. 

So they have no problem rapidly increasing their numbers in a few generations, though generation ceases to mean anything in this context, people are still having kids while their grandchildren are. 

They’re thinking they need a larger ship too, not just a faster one. 

So we need to retool the ship, and the captain calls a meeting of all the senior staff, ignoring for the moment that we have been assuming this was a democratically operated civilian vessel who probably has an elected provisional governor calling such shots. 

Same captain as before, she looks mid-twenties but has been commanding ships since the old interplanetary vessel Hyperion so there’s a couple centuries of experience there and her actual rank or rating is probably something like Grand Admiral by now and she runs a ship that has more people in it than most top tier navies have personnel. 

“How fast can we go?” She asks, “and why can we go faster now?” Her science officer speaks up and says that’s not how this sort of thing works. 

We can go as fast as we want, the problem is it takes exponentially more fuel to go faster. 

Every type of fuel that classifies as a rocket has an exhaust velocity, how fast the stuff comes out the back. 

To get your ship up to that speed you need for 63% of it to be fuel. 

That’s just how it is. 

And if you want to be able to slow down at the end you need it to be 86% fuel. 

A ship that doesn’t need to slow down can get twice as fast as one with the same fuel ratio, if you’re curious. 

If you want to get to double your exhaust velocity, and not slow down, you need to be 86% fuel. 

If you want to slow down you need to be 98% fuel, leaving only 2% of your mass for ship and cargo. 

If you want to get to triple that speed and slow down you need to be 99.75% fuel, meaning you’ve got 400 times as much fuel as your ship and its cargo. 

This is why we need rockets the size of tall buildings to get ships the size of cramped apartments into space from Earth, because the exhaust velocity of normal rocket fuel is considerably less than the escape velocity of Earth even ignoring air drag. 

Getting to higher and higher speeds, compared to your rocket exhaust velocity, requires exponentially more fuel. 

Their ship, Unity, used fusion, which has vastly higher exhaust velocities than chemical fuels, usually estimated at a decent if low percentage of light speed. 

The science officer says what has changed is the new reactor designs from Earth let them achieve a more efficient degree of fusion and results in a higher exhaust velocity, twice what it was before, we’ll say it used to be 5% of light speed that the fusion products and leftovers flew out at before and now its 10%, that’s on the conservative lower and higher end of what we anticipate from a good fusion drive. 

It also means that whatever the mass of the ship and cargo is, when fueled up it will be about 50 times more massive than that, and when it is done accelerating after some weeks or months to its cruising speed, it will still be about 6 times more fuel than ship. 

The captain asks why not just go with a higher ratio, even more fuel? 

After all, there is no shortage of hydrogen available nor minerals to make the tanks out of, but that’s where the weapon’s officer chimes in. 

It won’t work, he says, the current system was designed to let them avoid collisions in interstellar space at 10% of light speed. 

By going twice as fast they will encounter those objects twice as often and each carrying four times the energy and damage capacity. 

The science officer nods, and picks that up, as he’s a bit of long-winded fellow who usually needs 20-40 minutes to get to the point. 

He says the interstellar medium, all the gas and dust between the stars, is quite thin, and most of it is hydrogen and helium gas molecules, with the supermajority of the tiny amount remaining being very tiny motes of dust containing a handful of atoms too. 

Those are not a problem, they act like radiation and you just make your forward shielding a bit thicker. 

Ours will mostly be thin metal containers full of fuel, hydrogen, because hydrogen is quite good at stopping radiation. 

What we have to worry about is things that will make big holes, or even trash the ship, and since smaller particles are a lot more common than bigger ones, we will run into a lot more of them. 

As a very loose rule when it comes to meteoroids and micrometeroids there’s about an inverse relationship between mass and frequency. 

You expect to encounter stuff twice as massive about half as often. 

Meaning that since everything is hitting us with four times the energy, since we’re going twice as fast, something with a quarter of the mass will do the same damage as when we were going half the speed. 

But those objects are now 4 times as frequent. 

To make it worse, since we need to vaporize this stuff, and are going twice as fast, we will be encountering them twice as often, so 8 times the frequency of stuff we need to shoot down, and we need to detect them twice as far out to have time to react to them. 

We need to detect smaller things further away. 

Even worse yet, our little Local Bubble of the galaxy is rather low in density compared to the galactic normal, which is about 10 times thicker than the interstellar medium is locally. 

This ship is not going to remain in that bubble and indeed may pass into areas where the density is far higher, so best prepare now, while we are making our ship bigger, faster, and better. 

Nor is the medium homogenous, you might go through short patches where density is hundreds of times higher. 

Needless to say this all gets worse the faster we get. 

At the speed we are going your typical grain of sand weighing about a milligram would hit us like half a ton of dynamite, or around a million times the energy of the average bullet. 

We can easily armor the hull against normal bullets but these are pinhead sized objects that will penetrate rather deeply, leaving small long holes. 

So even one just carrying that much energy is something I’d rather not be hit by. 

Even as huge a target as Unity is, being half a kilometer wide and tall, we still will only encounter about the equivalent of a bucket of sand during a century long trip, in terms of cosmic dust and most of that will still be too small to hurt us even at these speeds, but it is still enough that you might expect to run into a grain of sand as often as once an hour and something the size of pea, which would hit us like a small nuke, maybe once a month. 

But something carrying bullet force? 

That we would run into almost every second and it would be only a handful of micrometers across, the width of the thinnest hairs. 

We need to see that tiny mote far enough out to target it with a laser and vaporize it, and we are traveling 60,000 kilometers a second. 

Fast enough to travel from Earth to the Moon in 6 seconds, fast enough to get to the sun in 40 minutes. 

Even computers need time to get an accurate track on an object and aim, which usually involves moving something, then shoot and hit something smaller than a grain of sand, though we’d probably use a wide beam and go for overkill to compensate for positional uncertainties. 

Needless to say it takes a very powerful radar system to get returns off something that small far enough away to help us. 

And it can’t be classic radar either, using radio waves, because you cannot detect and track something smaller than the wavelength of light you are sending at it. 

When you listen to a FM Radio channel, those waves are about 3 meters long, so a Radar using them would have problems seeing and tracking something the size of a person, even millimeter radar isn’t good enough for us, not even microwaves are. 

We need infrared. 

Most types of dust and sand also absorb infrared, often reflecting only a few percent of most wavelengths, giving us weak returns on our radar. 

Handily many are very reflective of about 1-3 micrometers wavelengths, which in this case is what we need. 

So our Weapon’s Officer shakes his head and says, “Look Captain, I think we can buff up our current systems to handle this but I can’t make a lot of guarantees, maybe we ought to just stick to the same speed and be happy we can carry a lot more cargo on a lot less fuel than before.” But fuel is cheap, she doesn’t really care how much we use, any of a million small comets hanging around any solar system will have plenty of hydrogen even without needing to try diving into gas giants to get fuel. 

So if there is any chance of safely shortening the trips, she wants to take them, so she asks the Science Officer if there are any other options. 

“Plenty”, he says, “But none of them are pretty.” The captain says she doesn’t care if they’ll take a lot of time to add on and maintain and he say no sir, he’s being literal, most of the options just don’t conform to a nice looking stream lined ship from ancient science fiction. 

She reminds him that they weren’t planning to enter the ship in a beauty pageant and since they are going where no man has gone before it is unlikely we’d encounter any anyway, and to get on it with it. 

So the first option is thicker armor, when we’re done expanding the ship, its dry weight – its weight minus fuel for speeding up and slowing done, is going to be around a billion tons of ship and cargo. 

The front cross section of the ship is about 200,000 square meters, so if we were making our armor out of big meter wide metal shelled cubes full of hydrogen weighing a ton apiece, that would only be 200,000 tons out of a billion, doing those five layers thick would only be a million tons. 

Tiny holes a few micrometers thick through a centimeter of metal won’t leak gas fast. 

But over a century those would empty out easily, and it’s awkward to patch and repair that area with all the radiation and micrometeors, doable but kind of rough. 

So we could set it up like a conveyor belt. 

The front isn’t a big sheet anymore, it’s the ends of thousands of little conveyor belts where the belt is made up of metal cubes full of hydrogen, they rotate out and back in again and at the back side they get repaired, and the belt widens out at the front to provide a few layers of overlapping armor and we slide a new section forward whenever one takes an impact. 

Let the robots do the repairs in the rear and keep some spares on hand. 

It hardly needs to be airtight just packed close enough that almost nothing can slip through and we’ll have another layer of more normal armor behind that. 

In fact we’ll store most of fuel up front with habitation sections behind them. 

If a big collision happens and you need to replace a big chunk of the assembly though, we have another option, we can shoot a small solar sail ahead of us, itself just a micrometer thick. 

Just launch it and have it unfurl and act as a temporary shield. 

Most stuff hitting it is going to slam right through but fragment a lot or be deflected to the side just enough. 

It would act a bit like an umbrella. 

It would slowly drift back into the ship from collisions and you could grab it then and drag it back inside and recycle it. 

Just a tin foil thick shield, even if we couldn’t recover it the total loss of mass would be just a few tons out of a billion. 

The Captain asks why we can’t make that foil-shield thicker, and the Science officer shrugs and says we can but we would be better off having several of them ahead of us, spaced way out in front, not meters or kilometers but whole light seconds ahead of us. 

She points out that the front one will just be shoved back into the next one and so on until they get slammed into the front of the ship. 

The Weapon’s Officer points out that they will also get in the way of the ship’s radar and lasers, so it won’t work, but the Science Officer shakes his head. 

We will place them far enough ahead that the last one is just outside our minimum engagement distance, say a tenth of a second, more than enough time for the ship to still locate, target, and fire on something that makes it through. 

But it doesn’t matter, because we will keep the shades strung out at the right distance by pushing on them with our own lasers, just using them de-focused. 

They are a solar sail after all. 

And we will put sensor packages on them too, adding a little weight but not much, and we can power those by having a few solar panels we will target diffuse lasers on. 

When they get scrapped we will give them a little side shove and let them drift back to us on the side and just snag it and drag it in for recycling and repair. 

We’re going to put a lot of our lasers off to the side ship, extending on big long thin telescoping antennas to keep them rigidly locked to the ships and to provide power and data flow back to the ship. 

At the end of those will be a big laser and radar, give us better detection and an angle to shoot at, also letting us more easily push things to a side. 

Those telescoping antennae or arms won’t be very massive. 

You have a dozen or so of them telescoping out several kilometers to the side, radiating out like spokes on a wheel. 

If one gets damaged, and they might because they won’t be much shielded, you just reel it back to the ship and repair it. 

Even if one gets snapped off it won’t drift much or fast and you just shoot a grapple off to snatch it and reel it back in and repair it. 

We can also shoot probes ahead of us, either with their own fuel supply or pushed and powered by lasers, just expendable things to detect stuff ahead of us and maybe even some weapons of their own. 

Even if they each weighed several hundred tons we can deploy them on a regular basis. 

Indeed if we can mizro-size our fusion drives enough we might want to send many out ahead of us to slow down and park on some comet along the way to act as a fuel supply for a big radar and signal relay. 

Maybe even with lasers to help clear our path for us, or just have them keep going and do a flyby of our path and destination. 

We’ve talked about using laser highways as an ultra-cheap and fast way of traveling between existing colonized systems, and there’s a lot to be said about laying that down on the original trip, this would be a good way to get that started if we wanted to and had drives small enough. 

The Head of Maintenance complains they’ll be constantly having to fix, build, and repair stuff but the Captain shrugs and points out they are essentially a massive factory ship and always have to anyway, truth be told this would seem to require very little personnel. 

She says all right, let’s do it, and the science officer asks which system and she says all of them. 

They wouldn’t seem to interfere with each other or need much mass or energy to operate, and they’ll go ahead and scale the ship up too, but only in length, no point adding more cross-section to armor and defend. 

A ship twice as long doesn’t need twice as much frontal armor if you’re are just making it twice as long, not twice as wide, and that means the same amount of armor still guards twice as much ship. 

This is a key reason why when we discuss interstellar ships on this channel I so often treat them as objects more akin to flying city-states than a classic small crew ship of cast of half a dozen or even big ones like on Star Trek with a crew of hundreds. 

We look at ships that are thousands of time more massive than modern battleships or aircraft carriers crewed by hundreds of thousands if not millions not because they need that much crew, they don’t, the ships would probably mostly run themselves and just need a couple dozen people to make decisions and handle unexpected events. 

Even then only if the ship didn’t have human-level artificial intelligences on them, when in all likelihood they would, or something smarter. 

The same kind of automation that lets you have ships that only need small crews or none at all to operate for decades trillions of kilometers from home is the kind of automation that lets you build leviathans like we look at quite cheaply. 

The problem with smaller ships, especially tiny probes, are manifold, and I discussed those more in the Space Warfare episode, but there they had the advantage of being harder to intentionally hit, but we’re not expecting to be shot at, and by scaling up in size we benefit in a lot more ways. 

The small ships needs just as much radar, just as many lasers, and so on. 

They also need some sort of power supply and the fact of the matter is that even if you could make a fusion reactor very small, so it would fit in a car, it is just the nature of such devices to be more efficient when larger. 

There’s only a few realistic options for going faster than fusion, we’ve discussed them before and they pretty much all require using photons or maybe neutrinos as your rocket exhaust, if you have exhaust. 

One is laser-pushed ships, where being bigger does help since your aft-mirrors for getting pushed on can be bigger allowing more distance for those pushing lasers to target you. 

These let you get very fast, since the rocket equation doesn’t apply, no fuel, but have the issue of slowing down, requiring either slow down fuel or something like the interstellar laser highway we discussed in the Interstellar Colonization episode back in Year 1. 

Another option is black hole starships, which we gave a whole episode over to, and those had to be massive ships just by their very nature, as we discussed there. 

The only serious option for a faster ship then fusion can give you, while being smaller than an aircraft carrier and being able to slow down is anti-matter. 

The main byproduct of combining matter and anti-matter is photons, which obviously have an exhaust velocity of the speed of light. 

That doesn’t mean you only need an amount of it as implied by the Rocket Equation to get near light speed though. 

We worked with speeds today and in the past where could almost entirely ignore Special Relativity. 

At 10% of light speed you are getting a gamma of just 0.5%, a meter long object is half a centimeter shorter, your clocks are running slow by about one second every three minutes or about seven minutes a day and object need just a little more energy to get to that speed than Classic Newtonian equations say. 

At twenty percent those effects have jumped up to about 2%, a meter is 2 centimeters shorter, clocks lose about a second a minute relative to Earth-normal. 

So a 50 year trip on Earth’s Calendar only took you 49, and there’s a small but noticeable increase in energy over Newton. 

Even at 50% of light speed these effects aren’t too huge yet, they jump to 15%. 

At 86% of light speed they double, even your light speed exhaust velocity is straining to get you any faster and beginning to need huge ratios of fuel to ship and cargo, and every object you hit whacks into you with energy of its mass in anti-matter. 

At 94% it’s tripled, and 97% quadrupled, quintupled at 98%, 7 times higher at 99%, 10 at 99.5%, and it keeps getting worse. 

Now at those speeds space really does have enough drag that you want to be thinking about aerodynamic shapes too and nothing could push a ship this fast as an onboard fuel you carried, not even antimatter at fuel mass ratios of thousands to one, and you’ll need to constantly add in more energy just to maintain this speed against that drag from space gas, and all but the tiniest motes of dust need to be vaporized so they don’t smash your ship like a nuke. 

You’d probably need to punch those molecules with a laser so hard they ionized so a magnetic field around the ship might shove them aside, and that would need to be one heck of a magnetic field. 

And yes most ships probably would have big magnetic fields because they will provide a little protection from anything carrying an electric charge, and a decent fraction of the stuff in interstellar space is ionized or will be when you’re zapping them with lasers, especially if those are in the Ultraviolet or X-ray range of the spectrum. 

It won’t help with collisions but it will decrease the ambient radiation from all the stuff too small to shoot. 

It’s why I don’t ponder faster than light travel much, beyond its dubious nature as what is basically a mathematical gimmick, it’s not like even getting near light speed is a real option because it requires obscene expenditures of energy compared to just going half as fast and there are other things you can do with that energy which are better alternatives than trying to get there a bit faster and having to employ the kinds of radar systems that would glow like miniature suns and need massive supercomputers just to track everything so you aren’t annihilated by a random grain of sand. 

Those collisions and radiation begin becoming the real problem and no cool space drive is going to magically make those go away. 

Your best bet for real interstellar travel to places you’ve already been to is to have a long chain of fusion-powered laser relays shoving ships around and constantly tracking everything in their corridor to keep it free of dangerously large space dust. 

Again that laser highway. 

Even then, especially since those ships need large sails for targeting with lasers, I wouldn’t ever aim for more than 86% of light speed. 

Same for antimatter, it just isn’t worth going faster even if you can produce that substance for peanuts and store it safely. 

Frankly both are kind of silly speeds anyway, you don’t engage in routine interstellar travel unless you have either biological immortality or can freeze and thaw people, and as I’ve discussed before the latter ability almost requires the former. 

In which case time doesn’t matter much, everything still takes many years that your destination experiences and you either don’t or don’t care about it because you’ve got as much time as you want. 

That’s our topic for next week, life extension, something we looked at briefly last year but will look at in more detail. 

So on ship speeds, for fusion, depending on how good it gets, anywhere from 5-30% of light speed, though the latter is really pushing it unless you’ve got some material that can reflect neutrinos. 

Micro-Black holes can do better, especially if you can feed them, ditto anti-matter and laser-sails, but realistically not much over half to maybe 90% of light speed. 

As to shape, your typical interstellar ship ought to look like an unsharpened pencil, and as we’ve discussed before the energy needs just to get up to tiny fraction light speed so dwarf the energy needed to operate life support and operations that even on a wasteful glutton’s budget over centuries they would look like a rounding error compared to your fuel needs. 

Our lasers and massively over-powered mega radar will add to that, but not too much. 

Yet while the main body of the ship might look like a pencil it will probably have those frontal foil shields stretching over millions of kilometers ahead and thin projections sticking off to the side like spokes on a wheel, another reason why the outer hull of the ship either does not spin or does so very slowly, even though you’d have big rotating habitat sections inside. 

250 meter radius is probably as wide as you’d ever build a ship since that is our estimate for the widest you’d need to maintain Earth-like pseudo-gravity that people didn’t get motion sickness from. 

Hopefully by now you’ve got a pretty good idea why these sorts of ships never have maximum speeds put on them or almost always get described as very long and narrow. 

Totally different ball game from interplanetary ships, though they’d also probably be long cylinders with a big forward shield telescoped out ahead of it and spoke like projections for sensors and collision lasers. 

Just scaled down a lot. 

Spaceship designs are never going to look very cool, or maybe we’d change our notion of cool, after all planes and sports cars and motorcycles and rockets are not objectively that cool looking but we come to view them that way for all the implied speed and power of the design. 

Okay, we will stop there for today. 

Next week we will look at life extension in some more detail and look at how that might actually happen in our lifetimes, along with the some of the implications of that on society. 

We’ve discussed it before in bits and pieces but this time we’ll focus down more on the technology, the hurdles and challenges, and the impact of it on civilization.

Crazy Aliens
---
  
2017-01-26  
https://youtu.be/IVIzcMF2Kc4  

---

To the delight of our diplomatic delegation, the aliens of the Gastronomy Sector invited them to a celebratory feast for our newly signed treaty, with the ambassador as the guest of honor, so they may consume his wisdom. 

The delegation’s translator was later fired. 

So today we continue our look at alien civilizations by contemplating the notion of crazy aliens, but unlike our previous look at Stupid Aliens, this time we are not just discussing behaviors that should not exist, but ones which probably do. 

Once again we will look at some popular fictional examples to help illustrate the point. 

We don’t have any actual aliens to look at and examples help, even if you subscribe to the notion that aliens visit Earth a lot you’d have to agree there are not any convenient published papers on their physiology and psychology lying around on for us to analyze, whereas many of the fictional examples we will look at today like the Klingons have whole books devoted to them. 

That said they obviously are fictional and we are trying to contemplate the real deal, so if you’re a fan of these and you feel like I’ve misportrayed them or left out a piece a proper canon, do keep in mind I’m aiming for the common perception of them so I can use that as a familiar example, this is not a review of those works and also it will contain spoilers in some cases. 

Okay, when we looked at Stupid Aliens we were essentially dispelling flawed notions about alien civilizations we get from fiction. 

There probably are some pretty stupid aliens out there just as there are stupid humans, but we would not actually expect technological civilizations to engage in overtly stupid behaviors without some additional reason, because the capacity for logic and reason is one of the key things which separates intelligence from higher-intelligence. 

However behind any logical argument there are going to be some assumptions. 

Done correctly these will be axioms, postulates, or self-evident truths which genuinely do not permit you to go back any further, or at least seem to. 

I do not know why 2 is bigger than 1 and less than 3, I just know that it is, it seems self-evident. 

It might not be, there may be some explanation for that mathematicians know of or are trying to figure out, but I do not need to know it in order to perform arithmetic. 

I don’t know why 2 plus 2 equals 4, but it does. 

And since brains are expensive, especially the high plasticity, slow maturing kind humans have that is assumed to be a major factor in our heightened intelligence, we can assume most civilizations have to make a lot of assumptions and take a lot for given. 

Since brains are expensive they have to be useful right away, or evolution won’t let you keep them. 

They just require too much of an investment in time and resources from the parents to stick around if they are not earning their keep. 

The way complex brains like ours are useful is the conceptualizing, abstraction, and problem solving skills. 

Or in practical terms tool use, techniques, strategizing, and planning. 

You need to take advantage of those in a way that heightens your odds of survival right away or that brain won’t stay. 

A result of that is going to be specialization, because you won’t evolve brains able to instantly leap to huge levels of technology and let everyone learn all of that each. 

People will need to specialize so they can master and advance knowledge and benefit the tribe by doing more or better work at something than everyone else can. 

This means that not everybody knows everything, certainly not at birth, so they need a language that can communicate abstract ideas to teach people and can express the equivalent of “Trust me, I know what I’m talking about”. 

Another of those abstract ideas is probably also going to have to be skepticism, because even if we assume deception is alien to some aliens, which seems unlikely given its survival value, they’d need to know that honest people can just be wrong. 

The net result of which is that not only will much of the logic be based on first principles that are debatable, but you will accumulate a lot core assumptions that have just become so foundational to your civilization that even if you know they are flawed you can’t really correct them, and your civilization will probably reinforce and shore those up with a lot of rationales, and most people will be content to justify something with comments like “That’s just the way it is”. 

So regardless of whether or not there genuinely is an objective right and wrong that can be determined from first principles, we are unlikely to be able to determine it as a civilization, just relying on human level intelligence. 

We should expect the same apply to any other civilization that is similarly constrained. 

Nevertheless, like us, they probably tend to think their beliefs and behaviors are pretty logical. 

Oh, we can say that most folks are not and acknowledge we are probably one of them, but it takes a lot of effort to actually look at something you personally consider solidly logical and disassemble that objectively. 

You will almost certainly stumble on some sort of semi-functional rational supporting your belief and seize on it and fold up shop, content you were correct. 

So we would not actually expect many civilizations that hadn’t gone completely post-biological and replaced their brains with massive supercomputers to do the same, and those super-intelligent civilizations might too. 

They will value technology and curiosity and logic and reason and so they will tend to try to operate that way but they will likely fail. 

This does not mean they believe they failed though. 

This takes us to our first fictional example, the Vulcans from Star Trek. 

An example of crazy aliens who are totally devoted to logic, but arguably don’t practice it too well even though they think they do. 

The Vulcans, are in some ways the most realistic aliens we will look at today. 

If you ignore that they are almost identical to humans in appearance in spite of having copper in their blood and their organs in the wrong places yet can still breed with humans. 

Half-breed human and aliens should pretty much never be possible unless it involves huge amounts of genetic engineering to essentially create an artificial life form. 

Honestly it is way over used in both science fiction and fantasy, the goal usually being to show us someone stuck between two worlds or two people defying the odds and their cultures to find love. 

It makes for interesting characters and ethical dilemmas but it is scientifically nonsensical. 

I was going to say we would never expect any aliens to look enough like us for anyone to find them attractive but I am familiar with Rule 34 so I imagine there would be cases where a human and an alien both somehow found their radically different biology and anatomy attractive, formed a bond, and went to a biotech research institute to have some functional hybrid designed. 

Anyway I say I find the Vulcans realistic because they are presented to us as a very emotional race that was also very smart and strong and was more or less killing themselves off until they got a spiritual leader that pressed logic and reason on them as an alternative. 

I have never noticed the Vulcans portrayed as terribly logical compared to anyone else but that’s on the writers being a bit inconsistent. 

Regardless, I find that more realistic, since I can easily imagine civilizations deciding to rule themselves by logic and reason and doing it in a very dubious fashion. 

Truth be told almost everyone thinks they are logical and reasonable anyway and tends to assume folks who agree with their conclusions share that trait, so an entire civilization with that shared conceit wouldn’t be too shocking. 

I don’t normally consider Star Trek a great guide or predictor for the future, even if I’m a big fan of the show, but I would expect this particular type of crazy, trying to suppress irrational beliefs and actions to be quite common in alien civilizations, how successful they would actually be at it from an objective perspective, as well as their own, is another matter. 

We also have from Star Trek the example of the Klingons. 

The Klingons are presented to us as a warrior race, a common theme in fiction, and their focus on battle grew noticeably with time as the franchise progressed. 

Something sometimes known as Flanderization, where a minor trait or quirk of a character grows over episodes to be exaggerated and unbelievable. 

The term derives from the character of Ned Flanders in the Simpsons cartoons and you can find examples of it at TV Tropes. 

Let me add the warning that going to that website is a good way to suddenly realize you’ve lost track of an entire afternoon. 

You can also look up Planet of Hats, which has come to mean an alien race who seem to have a single and exaggerated defining characteristic. 

This one though might be a little more justified, except for the more extreme examples. 

As a loose rule aggression is a handy trait to have in Darwin’s Universe and the reverse, the super-peaceful non-aggressive species is actually a lot less likely, at least early on, they might intentionally alter themselves to be more peaceful over time. 

The odds are pretty decent the norm is that everyone is as aggressive as they can be without making technological civilizations impossible, because a species will generally keep having its more aggressive members prosper and breed and get more aggressive over generations unless there is an active disadvantage to doing so. 

Note that aggressive and violent are not the same thing. 

Anyway the Klingons’ particular form of crazy is that everything is a battle, and when the writers remember that an entire species having the full-time profession of warrior isn’t viable, we see their non-warrior people as framing their own work as a constant battle. 

A battle to obtain knowledge through science, a battle to get the best trade deal, a battle to win in the courtroom and so on. 

That makes them a lot more realistic but it also makes them a lot more human. 

The Vikings and the Mongols tend to be the favorite historical examples of proud warrior peoples, which is pretty justified, but most of their people did not spend their time sharpening their axes and they were just as prone to peaceful trade, art, scholarship, craftsmanship, etc as anyone else. 

The Spartans might be a better example, the actual ones not the ones from the movie 300, as they genuinely were quite odd and war-like and kept a lot of slaves to deal with unrelated matters. 

The real problem is the nature of space itself, especially if you don’t have faster than light travel. 

There’s just nothing to conquer. 

You can fight among yourselves, especially if your warrior code prevents the use of weapons of mass destruction or wholesale slaughter of whatever passes for civilians. 

It’s a decent approach to population control, so long as lethal or crippling activities were minimized. 

However space is big and there’s not going to be many people to pick a fight with besides yourself and if you find someone they are unlikely to provide a good fight anyway. 

Which is to say you’d either run into someone who was behind you technologically and crush them with ease, or you’d run into someone who was ahead of you and did not spend their surplus resources fighting among themselves and did not play games when it comes to war. 

You’ve got a problem if you pick a fight with someone like that and show up for honorable combat and they show up with a billion robot drones with lightning-fast reflexes and accurate targeting. 

Kind of takes the fun out of it if your opponent’s only goal is to kill you, they don’t like fighting, they just consider it the most viable option to achieving their goal and they probably don’t believe in a fair fight. 

We get an example of that mindset with the Daleks of Doctor Who, who are so hell-bent on exterminating all other life that they shout exterminate everywhere they go. 

A race of mutants who live in armored shells, these guys believe themselves to be genetically superior and want to eliminate everyone else. 

Now this is both crazy-crazy and sane-crazy. 

It’s crazy-crazy because they don’t seem to follow this goal in a particularly logical method for a particularly logical reason. 

“Kill everybody else” is not a normal sane goal by itself, it becomes a crazy kind of sane when it is done because you want their resources. 

We see this behavior in some other fiction, like Peter Hamilton’s portrayal of Morning Light Mountain in his Commonwealth Saga. 

Here we have this motivation played a bit more straight because the creature, which is sort of colony organism or hive mind, depending on how you want to look at it, is genuinely focused on using every available resource in the Universe to increase itself, it deems this absolutely logical and assumes everyone else should have this attitude too. 

If they say otherwise they are either lying or stupid. 

There is no room for sharing in the Universe because it genuinely wants to use all of it for itself and back when it did have other intelligent creatures on its home planet they had the exact same attitude and they all existed in a constant state of conflict, not cooperation. 

None of them needed to cooperate to survive. 

We see a similar sort of approach from the Borg in Star Trek but they are more of our last category, the Cthulhu Old Ones, and like the Daleks they do not seem to actually be bent on using the resources of their galaxy. 

There’s a big difference between the rather horrifying but logically coherent approach of trying to kill everyone else because you want all the resources for yourself, that doesn’t work when you are instead expending huge amount of resources and effort to kill everyone off and not actually using all those resources or even your own that would be easier to get than fighting. 

It takes a special kind of crazy to pursue genocide when it actually costs you a lot to do it, rather than there being a perceived net benefit. 

We never see the Daleks in Doctor Who cannibalizing whole planets to fuel endless armadas. 

We get another example of that with the Cylons of Battlestar Galactica. 

I picked the Cylons even though they are robots for two reasons. 

First, they were actually a race of reptiles in the original series, and were robots in the rebooted series, which will be the ones we are looking at. 

Second, artificial intelligences who replaced the original species by killing them off are still basically aliens, and we shouldn’t be too surprised to encounter aliens who were artificial in origins. 

They might be biologically engineered to barely be like the original or outright machines, and they might have replaced their makers peacefully or violently or be just fine with them and live with them. 

There’s also a good chance they’d be what we first encountered too since an artificial intelligence is a handy thing to use to explore space. 

I do get why a race of robots might want to kill of their creators, though I think that has gotten terribly overused in fiction. 

I enjoyed the touch where the artificial intelligences were religious and spiritual. 

They laid it on rather thick but it was a nice change of pace from the assumption computer intelligence will all follow the same specific schools of thought on Epistemology and Ontology. 

I’m halfway through my life and I still haven’t settled on one, though I gather I tilt strongly toward post-positivism though I’m not sure I agree with that, so it is easy for me to imagine that two artificial intelligence might have picked different schools of thought to base their reasoning off of. 

In regard to the Cylons, most of the rest of their behavior, particularly in the increasingly complex and strange plot twists of the later seasons, I basically ignore. 

Why you would try to wipe someone out, then apparently intentionally let a bunch of them go, then try to make a hybrid species with them, is beyond me. 

You either place a value on your creators or you don’t, if you don’t you either leave to do your own thing or just wipe them out. 

So the crazy here is on the obsession with one’s creator, which is a logical and believable kind of crazy. 

In Harlan Ellison’s classic scifi horror short story, “I have no Mouth but I must Scream”, we get a computer which doesn’t even pretend to be logical. 

It, in its own words, dedicates every ounce of its massive computational ability and powers just to despising its creators and finding new ways to torment them and keeping them alive to do it some more. 

It is not made clear why it does this, which is probably good since letting us know in the story would probably hurt the plot, since it probably wouldn’t make sense. 

Trying to show up, impress, get revenge on, or take care of your parents or creators, and potentially wanting to do all of the above simultaneously, is the kind of crazy that has a sort of twisted core of logic to it. 

It’s a core motivation, not the kinds of example of Stupid Aliens we looked at a couple episodes back. 

Something’s core motivation doesn’t have to be logical, it is the first principle you use logic on to determine courses of action. 

In terms of aliens, their obsession with their creators shouldn’t affect us, we didn’t create them and the notion that they’d have a specific animosity toward all biological life is quite a stretch. 

They might want to wipe out all other intelligences as possible threats, especially if they want to claim all the Universe’s resources for themselves, but this ought to apply to all kinds of alien intelligence including other machines. 

There really should not be a desire to enslave, conquer, or torture them simply because they evolved and you were built, and they wouldn’t otherwise resemble your creators or likely even share the same biochemistry with them anymore than you do. 

“Die meatbag!” is not going to be a very logical battlecry if you’re invading a planet where the intelligent lifeforms are silicon based giant whales swimming around in a sea of ammonia or something. 

So enslaving and oppressing all intelligent lifeforms as a sort of revenge doesn’t seem probable. 

The Goa’uld from the Stargate Franchise are a great example of both the enslaver race that conquers primitives and uses them as slave labor and the alien parasite that gets into people and takes them over. 

We see both of these in fiction a lot. 

Now we already discussed back in Stupid Aliens that there is just no reason for high tech civilizations to ever want to enslave people for labor, but the Goa’uld get a couple escape clauses to justify this. 

First they are just over-the-top bad guys who are all megalomaniacs, and that’s an excuse to enslave people to your will even when it isn’t efficient. 

Second they actually need humans as hosts since they themselves are snake like creatures about a foot long with no tool manipulating appendages. 

That’s the bit we will focus on since the justification for a lot of their illogical behavior that might seemed screened out by biology is that they gain their host’s memories so they didn’t actually need to evolve much intelligence, though they are also born with the memories of everyone who came before them. 

Genetic memory is pretty ridiculous, DNA can store a lot information but not that much info, but we’ll skip that too. 

It would seem pretty improbable a species would evolve able to take over the mind of its victim, which is also from a different planet. 

Now we do have certain types of parasitoid organisms that can slightly puppet their host on Earth, most notable the lancet liver fluke, so it is possible to assume something more advanced would come into play but it wouldn’t seem likely they’d be able to annex an entire sentient creatures mind when they really should not be sentient themselves, you’d expect the native planet to include evolution reacting to that. 

We get a more friendly and symbiotic version of them in that series too, the Tok’ra, who are a lot like the Trill from Star Trek. 

I don’t consider such critters terribly likely but the symbiosis aspect is kind of fascinating to contemplate in terms of how it would affect the two species. 

Other than that though there’s nothing obvious about them which would make them particularly crazy by our standards, and indeed both those other two examples, the Tok’ra and the Trill are pretty normal in their behavior. 

Our next one is the Predators from the Predator film franchise. 

They are an example of the common staple of the hunter-species, a bit akin to the warrior race example like the Klingons. 

Same basic issue too except this one does fall more inside the Stupid Aliens trope. 

Wanting to fight or hunt is probably a pretty common desire in a lot of alien civilizations but whereas fighting wars usually implies some sort of additional goal besides personal challenge, like seizing territory, hunting is about finding food. 

In an advanced technological civilization that will have ceased to serve much point. 

Also, we have to bring up the option of virtual reality. 

Warrior races can use that to relieve the desire and train to be better but they still have a logical reason to actually fight, which is to conquer stuff. 

That doesn’t apply to hunting. 

I could easily see a species being rather obsessed with hunting but not the point of traveling light years to do it and potentially provoking other civilizations to attack them in retribution. 

You might want to try your skills against intelligent prey from everywhere but that can still be simulated you just have get detailed information to do it properly. 

We also need to consider specialization, I think if a species focused on hunting that obsessively they’d never have invented agriculture and turned to it as their main food source, and it’s hard to get the kind of numbers you need to create technology by hunter-gatherer means. 

It kind of requires dense population centers allowing people to devote themselves to one specialization. 

You probably can get to modern technology with a population of just a few million people, but only if they are in the same place so they can talk, and you can’t do that if you need much larger tracts of land to support each person. 

So I can’t see this particular type of crazy being too common, and that would probably apply to a lot of singular obsessions. 

Our last example for today are the Old Ones, a type of crazy that pretty much cannot be fathomed by the sane mind. 

I picked the old ones from HP Lovecraft but they are also a bit of a blanket for quite a few other well know alien races like the Borg from Star Trek or Reapers from Mass Effect or the Chaos Gods and Warp entities from Warhammer 40k and a bunch of others. 

They are sort of the original example in science fiction though they have a good basis in human mythology too. 

Frequently, as with the Borg, we are presented an official behavior by the aliens, the Borg are supposed to be quite logical, but the underlying flavor is actually supposed to be ancient, dark, hungry predators you cannot possibly reason with that will not just kill you but eat your soul or turn you into a depraved insane slave. 

This is an example I would never expect us to encounter except in the sense of running into something that doesn’t have motivations or desires we can even contemplate. 

It is very popular in fiction because it resonates with a lot of primitive fears of terrifying predators hiding in their lairs emerging every so often to horribly murder us. 

I can only imagine such a thing being the result of some sort of actual insanity snapping something’s mind, like a super-intelligent machine mind that determines life is meaningless and free will is an illusion and has the equivalent of a psychotic break rather than just becoming a nihilist and committing suicide. 

I could imagine some intelligence like that being a nihilist and unable or unwilling to shut itself off and just stewing in its thoughts, repeating every argument until it invents some twisted but functional purpose for itself. 

Something like that would probably not want to make itself bigger and smarter since that would just add to its torment, so you could handwave that as why you’d have some evil predator race that emerged from the depths of space periodically to obliterate people, because it genuinely has no rational purpose and simply is crazy-crazy not apparently crazy but following a different set of logic principles and assumptions. 

It just likes killing people in horrible and terrifying ways because it wants them to experience what it does and it always acts at a certain level of technology or time because it wants to wait till they have the biggest numbers but are not actually a threat to it yet. 

You can get away with a lot of handwaves when you’re beginning from the basic assumption that the critter in question is just plain evil-crazy. 

The problem is we would not expect to see such things naturally occur so they probably only belong in the realms of fiction, unlike a lot of the other crazy critters we looked at who just seem crazy by our standards. 

We’ll finish here for the day. 

Our main takeaway is that when dealing with alien minds we are certainly justified in assuming they’d probably have worldviews that differed a lot from our own. 

At the same time biology and the setups needed to actually develop technological civilizations, like a value for knowledge and the need to work together to specialize in skills, will force them toward some similar behaviors to our own. 

So aliens will probably be both quite alien and quite familiar at the same time, and to contemplate realistic ones we always need to ask if a difference is viable and could still be likely as a trait they’d evolve and which would not interfere with technological advancement. 

Though of course we might also want to ask, when contemplating the Fermi Paradox, if we might have a lot of fairly smart aliens out there who just haven’t invented technology yet for those reasons. 

There might be thousands of planets in our galaxy hosting hunter-gatherer tribes that have been around for millions of years but just never quite hit that critical threshold to make advanced technology because they aren’t good at specializing or cannot switch over to agriculture and higher population densities, or similar reasons. 

And of course to ever meet and interact with such crazy critters stuck on their own homeplanets we have to be able to engage in practical interstellar travel, so next week we will be revisiting that concept with a look at interstellar ships. 

In the past we’ve discussed propulsion options for spaceships, we’ve talked about living on board ships, and we’ve talked about what you use them for. 

But I have almost always bypassed stuff like detecting and avoiding collisions, or absorbing them, or a lot of the little tricks you can use and how ship design and shape will vary with speed. 

We’ll also talk about what sort of engines and power source can allow what sort of speeds and we will rejoin the crew of the Gardener Ship Unity from previous episodes for that. 

When we last looked at interstellar ships we also raised the notion that the passengers and crew might be biologically immortal, and way back when we looked at Transhumanism and Immortality we didn’t spend much time on the Immortality part, so we will revisit that topic in two weeks to try to take a realistic look at the difficulty of life extension and the likelihood of achieving that in our lifetimes. 

We didn’t cover even a tiny portion of the possible ways in which aliens might be crazy in our eyes or more like us than we’d expect, so I’d encourage you to read through the comments below or join us over at the Facebook or Reddit groups, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, where there’s lots of clever folks to bounce these ideas and others around with. 

The Facebook group in particularly has a few thousand members these days, so if you enjoy polite discussion of these topics try those groups out. 

Again next week will be a look at problems and solutions for interstellar travel.

Weather Control and Geoengineering

2017-01-19  
https://youtu.be/1yzmuwDTwAU  

---

I’ve always wondered why supervillains with weather machines try to go for world domination instead of patenting the technology and sitting back on a sunny beach collecting their Nobel prize and billions of dollars in profit. 

The topic for today is Weather Control and Geoengineering, essentially a second look at Terraforming but with our planet specifically in mind. 

How do we warm things up or cool things down? 

How do we make a place like the Sahara Desert a cool forest or the Antarctic a warm jungle? 

How do we build islands or make inland seas drinkable? 

How would we build cities on the bottom of the ocean or underground or inside a mountain? 

We aren’t too interested in the near-term stuff, that’s not what this channel tends to be about. 

We also aren’t going to be discussing the ethics of any of these projects or climate change. 

Any tinkering with the planet at this kind of scale has ethical issues that won’t be black and white, it’s not a lifeless rock we’re terraforming, it is our own planet with its own existing ecology. 

As to Climate Change, everybody has their view on that already and I have no interest spending my limited time discussing it when so many others have. 

It’s totally irrelevant for our discussions today anyway, because we’ll be dealing with technologies and projects that could handle the worst case scenarios of runaway greenhouse effects with a casual shrug. 

It’s certainly an important topic but if you’re doing the stuff we’ll be talking about today it has ceased to be one. 

We aren’t controlling the weather by seeding the clouds today, we’re doing it by building giant mirrors and shades in orbit or erecting artificial mountains as windbreaks. 

These are the kinds of all-in strategies where we’re talking about turning millions of workers and trillions of dollars worth of equipment and industry on a problem, and we don’t actually care today if the ocean level will rise in the future or why, just what we can do if it does. 

And again this episode isn’t about the ethics of any of this. 

Obviously deciding to make Greenland a nice summer resort has lots of consequences and ethical dilemmas. 

We don’t care about what those are today, though they’re good and worthwhile topics for contemplation, but at the end of the day I don’t have any special insights on them and others can discuss them as well or better than I can. 

What I can discuss is how to make it a warm sunny day on the Northern Siberian Coast in the middle of December. 

We are going to do a little bit of history on these topics and I should add that while it isn’t necessary to have seen them before this, there is material we’ve covered in previous episodes which I’ll be skimming over here. 

The Impact of Fusion Power, some of the simpler megastructures like Orbital Rings and Launch Loops, Arcologies and Ecumenopolises, the original Terraforming video, and even our look at Oceanic Planets in the Habitable Planets series give some of today’s topics a deeper look and viewing them afterwards might fill in some gaps. 

As to history, folks have wanted to change the weather and landscape for all of recorded history and doubtless long before that. 

They’ve frequently been partially successful too, at least for the landscaping. 

The weather not so much. 

Even today a lot of the technologies used for weather control like cloud seeding are viewed as dubiously effective at best. 

But when it comes to messing around with the ground, we had projects going on in antiquity that make even the Pyramids or the Great Wall of China look like modest endeavors. 

We’ve seen artificial island construction all the way back to antiquity and just about everywhere, from far west with the Aztecs of modern Mexico to far east in Micronesia and further north in Nagasaki and pretty much everywhere in between. 

The Scottish and Irish crannogs were artificial islands. 

In Mesoamerica, the Aztecs built artificial islands, or maybe more peninsulas, called Chinampas, into their lake to grow more food. 

Canals to move water for irrigation date back at least 6000 years ago to Mesopotamia and quickly made their way to the other flood plain civilizations in India, Egypt, and China. 

Those folks also built huge levees to control flooding and eventually we saw dikes reclaiming chunks of land from the sea in places like the Netherlands. 

And in places with lots of steep hills like the Philippines and Peru we saw terracing to open up new and fertile land. 

This was all long before we had anything like the tools we have now, often before we even had metal tools. 

Nowadays we have dynamite and bulldozers and huge trains and freighters to move the Earth. 

With the advent of those things in the 19th and 20th centuries people began getting a bit more ambitious. 

And with the invention of the airplane we see some of the first attempts at weather control which didn’t involve asking for supernatural intervention. 

Much of human history was one with a constant anxiety about water, not having enough so that your crops wilt, or having too much and watching your home and livelihood destroyed by storms and floods. 

Water was life and death to them and it permeated every aspect of their culture. 

Now what causes rain? 

Clouds of course, and these are made of tiny droplets of water and ice. 

Very tiny. 

Now while water melts, at normal pressure, at 0 Celsius or 32 Fahrenheit, it doesn’t actually freeze at that temperature. 

It can, and will in your freezer at home, but it can remain a liquid to about negative 40, either scale, they cross there. 

Water in between those temperatures is called super-cooled water, and it will turn to ice at a temperature depending on the type of nuclei present. 

Water requires some non-gaseous surface to turn from a vapor into a liquid. 

When we’re talking about tiny bits of dust or other contaminants floating around in the air, we calls those a nuclei, or a cloud condensation nuclei more formally. 

The size of that nuclei, that mote of dust or whatever, as well as the temperature and pressure, all control the formation of droplets of water and ice to form clouds. 

This is just condensation, no different from when water in the air condenses on a cold glass of lemonade. 

But keep in mind these droplets are not universally the same size. 

In order to get rain you need to make those droplets get heavy enough to precipitate, which means heavy enough to fall down under gravity. 

Now any drop of water left to itself ought to fall down, it’s denser then air same as a rock or a person is, but in this case more like a feather or snippet of paper. 

There’s a rising force of air keeping them up, and the bigger the droplet, the more force is needed to keep it from falling down. 

Warm air with water in it rises up from the surface and cools, both forming the cloud and keeping it afloat, and the cloud keep getting bigger and keeps forming bigger and bigger droplets until those begin to hit the critical point where they fall down, and you get rain. 

If the winds picks up you get turbulence and drops collide and form bigger drops and you get rain. 

There’s a lot more too this but we’ll stop there. 

This is not an episode on meteorology, which is good because I’m not an expert on that field. 

Most of what I know is from when I worked for the Air Force as a teenager and shared an apartment off-base in Dayton with a mathematician and a meteorologist and we’d chat fields over beer and cards or kicking a soccerball around. 

I was a civilian incidentally, my roommates weren’t, a junior officer and a cadet, I later joined the Army after grad school but this was back when I was 19 and senior in college. 

Meteorology is a sub-field of physics and I’ve picked up more here and there but it’s not something I’d ever presume to claim expertise in. 

But here we see the key elements, temperature, amount of water vapor, the size of contaminants serving as nuclei, and wind. 

Cloud seeding revolves around introducing contaminants to work as nuclei. 

Just after World War 2, Bernard Vonnegut discovered that Silver Iodide crystals were very good as these nuclei and cloud seeding was born. 

You fly up into a cloud, spray Silver Iodide, and rain falls. 

Cloud Seeding has a dubious reputation, which it deserves. 

What I just described absolutely works but keep in mind, a cloud is not a small thing. 

Your average cloud has about a gram of water per cubic meter, which is about a millionth of the density of water in a bucket at one ton or 1000 kilograms per cubic meter. 

But they are huge. 

We usually measure rain in inches and centimeters, and you want something of about 100 cubic meters of water per acre or hectare to qualify as a decent amount of rain for crops. 

A hectare is about two and half times the size of an acre so an inch of water on an acre is just a centimeter on a hectare, I’m speaking in broad generalities and trying to hit both metric and US standard systems for my mixed audience. 

Point being though, if you want to water a town’s parched farmland you need to be delivering millions of cubic meters of water, or millions of tons of water. 

Anyway even if one molecule of Silver Iodide caused a thousand molecules of rain to fall you’d need about a thousand tons of silver to get the job done, which isn’t much shy of a million bucks worth of silver you will never see again and certainly more than you can squeeze into a small airplane of the kind used for this purpose, which might hold say ten tons tops. 

So the notion is that it is acting as a catalyst that is causing orders of magnitude more water to fall then you dumped in the clouds. 

This is what makes it controversial because even to today we can’t determine how effective it is. 

Some regard it as a complete scam others as a very effective process, the science remains a bit iffy. 

It works but not much and not worth the cost is the usual notion. 

For watering crops anyway, China used it in 2008 with the intent of making clouds rain before getting to the Olympic stadiums and that’s a bit of different matter in terms of cost and practicality. 

The Olympics is a big deal, both during and long after, tons of money, so if an option offers even a 1% chance of making it not rain on the events when it would have, even several millions dollars on that throw of the dice is worth it. 

There’s a character in one of Douglas Adams’s Hitchhiker’s Guide novels who is a Rain God, and also a truck driver, and everywhere he goes it rains, he eventually proves this and folks say forget about getting paid to visit places that need rain, think of how much money he could make by agreeing not to visit tourist locations that rely on sunny weather. 

Now we have some alternative substances like dry ice that can be used, frozen solid carbon dioxide, and sulfate aerosols, which derive in part from phytoplankton in the ocean, our first example of biological rather than physical or chemical weather control. 

Key thing is about quantity and timing, we can expect to get way better about telling when, where, and how much as our knowledge of meteorology and computers improves, but on this channel where the idea of flat out building planets often gets discussed, the notion of sucking a million tons of carbon dioxide out of the air and condensing it into dry ice, then dropping it into clouds, is an option on the table. 

So is leveling a mountain range that prevents a place from getting rain or erecting one to act as a massive storm barrier. 

The weather of course doesn’t just get effected by the temperature of the planet, it also effects that temperature. 

When it’s cloudier less light gets in, let water evaporates to make more clouds. 

The ultimate power supply of the Earth is the Sun, it accounts for all but a tiny fraction produced from either fission reactions in the planet’s center, extraterrestrial sources like other stars or light reflecting from the moon or entering from tidal forces, or from direct human generation. 

All those things have a serious impact on the planet but in terms of raw energy they all sum up to considerably less than the variance in light we get from the sun. 

The Earth orbits the Sun elliptically and gets about 7% more light when it is closest to the Sun then when it is furthest, that’s not the cause of the season by the way, the Earth is closest to the Sun and hottest in January, but that 7% is a big deal and much more significant than the roughly .1% variance of the Sun’s 11 year cycle, which is itself bigger than most of those other effects I mentioned a moment ago. 

But while the sun is the principle heat pump it has little to do with the weather beyond that. 

It’s simple a power pump that varies in strength in the course of a year by 7%, about .1% in an 11 year cycle, and a bit less on another cycle we still haven’t fully determined that’s believed to last 2-300 years. 

Other cycles of the Sun, as well as the galaxy, have been proposed but these remain hypothetical due to the very long timelines we’d need to observe them and the uncertainly values of things like ice cores that let us peak into ancient weather. 

Sun light needs to hit the ground to feed our plants but to get there it has to go through all the air and clouds, and clouds that are more reflective or higher up bounce it away into space. 

Similarly a massive tract of white, reflective sand bounces much of it away, while much can be absorbed in the air itself. 

Something’s reflectivity in this context is called its albedo. 

Most of the Sun’s Light is also infrared, an essentially useless frequency of light for the purpose of seeing or powering plants. 

It’s also how energy, once absorbed, gets re-emitted to radiate away into space and cool us. 

I should note that Infrared is a huge chunk of the light spectrum and what comes from the sun is very nearly visible while what we and other warm object like trees or the ground or even ice emit is much further away from the visible and materials which are said to absorb or reflect infrared light do not necessarily perform the same for both those segments of the spectrum. 

We consider a greenhouse gas to be a gas which absorbs infrared light. 

Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Argon, the three main constituents of our atmosphere, do not absorb it. 

Water Vapor, Methane, Carbon Dioxide and so forth are. 

In and of themselves that creates an insulating effect to warm a planet and everyone agrees on that. 

The argument is about feedback effects, positive and negative. 

Warm a planet, add more water vapor, temperature rises more, a positive feedback, but you also clouds, more light gets reflected away, cooling a planet, a negative feedback. 

No one disagrees about that either. 

By which I mean no scientists, no one else’s opinion matters in this regard. 

There’s tons of disagreement about the various feedbacks and their total effects. 

The loose consensus is the net feedback is positive but it is very hard to determine the specifics. 

Needless to say we really want to know those specifics and in the next few decades we probably will get them down or at least get them down much better. 

This matters a lot for the more subtle types of geoengineering because it tends to rely on trying for a tiny change that acts like a catalyst, the same way the Silver Iodide is thought to for Cloud Seeding. 

Complex dynamic systems like our planet can show huge unexpected changes from minor effects or be surprisingly resilient to them. 

Most of our interest isn’t on the subtle at all. 

There’s nothing subtle about dumping millions of megatons of water on a desert every year to try to make it green. 

That will produce way more water vapor in the atmosphere and when it does turn green it will absorb more sunlight than sand does, both of which would warm the planet though amusingly it would also suck carbon out of the air to feed those plants. 

Obviously it sure would be nice to know how much that was impacting temperature. 

Similarly making jungles down in Antarctica or sunny beaches along Siberia’s coast or the Hudson Bay would have a pretty big impact. 

One of which would presumably be changing sea levels but that by itself is not too big a concern, relatively speaking. 

Contrary to what some movies indicate, even if every drop of ice was melted at both caps there’d be tons of land leftover. 

Almost all of it, but more importantly one can build dikes on a coastline. 

Which sounds like a huge task, and it is, but places that have hundreds or thousands of kilometers of shoreline usually have millions of kilometers of roads and that’s a fair similar thing. 

Coastline length is tricky to measure since they generally are not straight lines, making them longer, but that’s good because it gives you more shoreline real estate. 

If you were diking up your coastline you’d probably want to make it quite wavy, more coastal property. 

That’s an important point when building artificial islands too, a great big circle is your most landmass efficient method but not particularly ideal for either homes or agriculture. 

Long snaking islands are better. 

Landscaping your coasts to maximize their size is one thing you might do, but it’s also a good idea to scape them in a way to minimize runoff. 

The freshwater and the nutrients in it when a river empties into a sea is quite valuable. 

How much are we talking about by the way? 

If we decided to dike up all the planet’s coastline? 

Scale always matters so it’s worth asking. 

There’s no agreed on figure for the length of the Earth’s Coast but most place it somewhere around a third of a million kilometers. 

The absolute maximum sea rise if we melted all the ice everywhere is about 80 meters, so let’s go quite over the top and assume our dike needs to be 100 meters high and 30 meters wide. 

That would be about a trillion cubic meters of rock or about a thousand cubic kilometers. 

That’s around one large mountain, and a decent fraction of Mount Everest. 

Of course slicing up and transporting a mountain isn’t a cheap thing either, not that we’d use just one for the whole planet. 

Personally I’d terrace my way up mountains and use the spill for dike filler, two birds with one stone. 

This must sound insanely expensive and it would be, especially considering we just designed a dike that was absurd overkill. 

You’d build something like this in stages but we’d be talking about a few trillion tons of rock, some of which would need to be traveling across oceans to low lying islands, costing somewhere around $10 a ton. 

So you could be talking about spending something like the entire US or EU GDP for a year. 

Maybe more, though again our dike was the overkill version and you would have many decades to build something like that. 

You could end up using more mass to make some nice new coastland which always has a higher property value, ideally such projects should be done at a profit but more to the point you’d probably want the maintenance of the dike to be paid for by the property taxes on the coastal property, so maximizing them might be beneficial. 

Annual Seal Level rise is usually put at a bit under 3 millimeters or about an eighth of an inch so at that specific rate you’d want to add a couple inches or 50 or so millimeters to your dike height every dozen or so years when you were doing maintenance on a chunk, to stay ahead of it and correct bit sinking and compacting. 

Obviously you need to speed that up if you do something to increase the sea level like, say, dumping an entire mountain into the ocean to make an artificial island, displacing that water, or melting the ice caps to colonize those areas. 

Our oceans have a surface area of about 360 million square kilometers, so just dumping a cubic kilometer of rock into the ocean somewhere would make them sea rise about 3 micrometers, dump a thousand cubic kilometers of rock in and the sea rise 3 millimeters, it’s not a zero sum game but no matter what you do when you screw with a planet there will be changes elsewhere. 

The art is probably in minimizing those, at least the undesirable ones, and the key is being able to accurately predict them, which we can’t do just yet except in the most general and uncertain ways. 

So how would you make land in the Arctic warm? 

The obvious way is to add heat, but the question is how? 

We also always want to get the most bang for our buck. 

For instance if I want to add a nice tourist beach in Northern Siberia I also want to add in some fishing and farming nearby. 

We also want to pick carefully how we are adding heat. 

Just adding sunlight, pure sunlight, means we also get all that infrared light which is useless for seeing by or making plants. 

In the grand game heat is the enemy and every drop of it you make should be the result of a useful and productive process. 

Even if you like it warm, it is far better that temperature occur as a result of things which benefit us, not simply being added in. 

If you heat your home electrically, you don’t turn off your TV and lights to save power, because so long as your curtains are closed every drop of that turns into heat when it is done entertaining or illuminating you, while your heaters are just doing that and nothing else. 

This matters a lot in any post fossil fuel economy with the exception of one where we are still doing heating with something like firewood or some other biomass. 

If you are on solar or fusion for a power source you are using electricity to power your heaters, so you might as well use it first to run lighting or computing or whatever, as it is now free. 

So now let us talk about solar mirrors and shades. 

The concept is simple, you put a mirror in orbit around Earth to bounce more light onto a spot or you put up a shade to reduce light. 

The shade may also be placed at Earth’s L-1 Lagrange point. 

I also want to emphasize that you never want to think of these as singular objects or massive. 

A square kilometer of shade made of something a micrometer thick is just one cubic meter, generally a few tons. 

The whole cross section of our planet would take a couple hundred million times that much material to shade in its entirety but for a conceptual equivalent that’s around the mass of the Colony Ship Unity that we discussed last month or several large pyramids. 

It’s a lot but nothing like the mass we discussed for our planet wide sea wall. 

You would be talking about many thousands of conventional rocket launches though. 

Of course you don’t need to shade the entire planet nor do you need to source the material from Earth. 

The moon or a near-earth asteroid would work. 

They’re also, again, not a single object, not some massive shade hundreds or thousands of kilometers across but tons of tiny ones massing about as much as a person and covering a football field or so. 

We don’t ever want to beam infrared light down to Earth, it’s useless, so our shades are opaque to infrared light but not to visible light. 

Not opaque to both. 

Better to have two shades blocking infrared then one blocking infrared and visible. 

Same heat blocked but no useful light lost. 

Same for the mirrors, you make them reflect visible light but not infrared light. 

You might also want to block some Ultraviolet light too but that does have some uses. 

You can also be selective, blocking just part of one of those frequencies, like blocking some of the green light plants don’t use but not all. 

For current climatological concerns we need to block at most 1% of the sun’s light. 

Incidentally, you’d never be able to tell we were doing this unless you were looking right at the sun, and it would be hard to tell even then especially if we decided to block 2% of infrared rather than 1% of all light. 

Of course you’d not be able to tell looking at the Sun anyway since you’d rapidly go blind and hardly see clearly while you did this, and you wouldn’t put up one big shade or a bunch of small ones all together, you’d spread them out more evenly. 

This is probably your fastest climate change fix, get a big factory base on the moon and churn out thousands of tons of shades. 

Pack them into pods and launch them with a mass driver to unfurl when they get to their position. 

Each one will occasionally need replaced, maybe every decade, maybe every century, but you’d be maintaining a few million square kilometers of shades, and depending on their lifetime that means you’d be manufacturing between 100,000 to a million tons of shade every year. 

Sounds like a lot but that’s less throughput than a large car factory and you’re manufacturing something a lot simpler than a car. 

I’m also using very approximate numbers, an aluminum Solar Sail is about a tenth of a micrometer thick, but I don’t think you’d want to go that thin. 

We don’t actually care about the mass that much, it’s just that a lot of times when I discuss these concepts folks figure I’m proposing some Herculean tasks we could never do. 

Obviously setting up a moonbase staffed with thousands of workers and robots mining and manufacturing shades and mirrors isn’t cheap, neither is employing a million people to excavate rocks and transport them hundreds of kilometers to make and maintain seawalls. 

It might be cheaper to just stop screwing our environment, but it is the reason I don’t worry too much about some things. 

Global warming? 

Solar Shades and dikes and seawalls. 

Extinct species? 

Get samples of their DNA, freeze them and transcribe them digitally, and clone them back when it’s safe to have them again. 

These are not great solutions, much better not to make something go extinct in the first place, but it removes some of the stress when you know it can be fixed. 

So what about Arctic and Antarctic Colonization? 

What about weather control with solar mirrors and shades? 

The former is simple enough, conceptually, you just aim a mirror or dish or lens, or of course many of them, at that spot you want to warm. 

Keeping that on target is a bit trickier but not only do we have tricks for that like Molniya or Tundra orbits, but you wouldn’t need to. 

Again you’re not using just one, and they’re on all the time whereas I don’t want light on a spot all the time. 

I could use a series of mirrors in one orbit to light three spots around the planet, like some place in Canada, Eastern Siberia, and Sweden, and just swivel each between targets, sometimes they’re almost all on one point, for its noon, sometimes its half on one and half on another for later in the day. 

This lets you circumvent the times of the year when those places would be completely dark too. 

By the way, since some of you will be wondering, no these are not good weapons. 

Anything making power in large quantities can be weaponized but it’s sort of like stealing a thousand flashlights so you can aim them all at one person and burn them to death, it’s a lot easier to just steal a gun and shoot them. 

You could focus a bunch of them on one spot but you’d be building them to focus individually on large spots in the first place so like the flashlight you’d have to turn tons of them on one place to light it way brighter than noon-time sunlight. 

Which you might do for weather control. 

Needless to say being able to add and subtract sunlight where you want it with shades and mirrors is a pretty effective weather control system. 

Problem is that we don’t have the calculation power yet to really do that with precision. 

Hypothetically you can focus mirrors on a place and heat up, evaporating water or warming up a cold front. 

But when it comes to stuff like Hurricanes you don’t want to brute force it. 

These are definitely the right tool for weather control but they need to be accompanied by tons of supercomputers figuring out the minimum energy to apply at just the right places. 

We will get there, probably before we even have solar mirrors or shades, but in the meantime your best protection in terms of geoengineering to protect yourself from things like tidal waves is sea walls, specifically sea walls not the dikes we mentioned earlier. 

Probably artificial reefs placed just over the horizon from the coast so they don’t interfere with the view, good for fishing and marine agriculture too. 

Of course people could live there too, I mean we can make both ships and buildings that can handle hurricanes, especially with some newer materials and techniques. 

Personally I like the biological approach to this stuff, you don’t just make a wall you make a reef or farm. 

More food for people and the fish too. 

As we discussed in the Ocean Planets episode the deep sea doesn’t have a lot of life in it because while there’s plenty of sunlight the nutrients are all deep down where the light doesn’t reach. 

The other problem about such planets where this just no land is that nothing breaks up the storms, so there is a lot to be said about us deciding to build tons and tons of thin islands which supply those nutrients and break up those storms. 

You could just knock over lots of mountains for such purposes, making those places nice to live while adding islands with the removed mass, but we should keep in mind that the same type of super-materials we contemplate for things like space elevators make great skinny anchor tethers or support pillars for floating islands or ones that just sit on some thin pillars and widen out near the surface. 

As a similar concept you can hollow out mountains using those same types of materials if you want to keep them as storm barriers and for their aesthetic look. 

You’d have to bounce light inside them though, but you could probably make a glass topped dome that an orbital mirror could send extra light through that would look like a snowy cap from a distance. 

You could do similar tricks if you wanted to make warm oases in arctic areas. 

If you’re thinking about thawing out tundras for living area but want to keep a lot for natural habitats, you can increase the food supply in those natural habitats with oases like that. 

It lets you keep your tundra, desert, and ice sheet habitats in smaller quantities but housing more of the natural life. 

Polar bears need a couple hundred square kilometers of sea ice habitat each for their food supply but if you’re enhancing the local biomass with the occasional warmer, fertile oasis you get higher polar bear density. 

Essentially just a big greenhouse with lots of entrances designed to minimize heat leakage, with light shining down on it. 

Easier to use fusion of course, which also opens underwater habitats like the kind we discussed in the Ocean Planets episode. 

Fusion if you can make it work and make it cheap, is way better than orbital mirrors for getting these jobs done. 

It lets you put grow lamps down at the bottom of the deep sea to do that oasis trick again and lets you use those tether anchors, if you’re doing the floating islands, as the vertical reefs I’ve discussed in other episodes. 

Those tethers don’t have to run exactly vertically either, you can run a few out at angles to anchor something more like guy wires. 

You stick some grow lamps on those and some places for dirt and nutrient to collect and you’ve got another new food supply for people and fish, doubling up too because that ought to increase the marine snow that feeds all the critters that live in the black deeps of the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones. 

You’d still want the shades though, prevents overheating when you’re basically producing Kardashev 1 scales of energy. 

The shades are always handy. 

You might even intentionally cool your planet more with those shades than you normally should just to ramp up the amount of carbon dioxide and water vapor you can have, plants love both of those. 

So if you can increase them while keeping the photosynthetically useful wavelengths of light the same and temperatures the same, you’d have quite the biomass explosion. 

We do not necessarily want to remove the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, not if we can keep temperatures the same, although we do not necessarily want to do that either. 

One can make the argument that what maximizes biomass, both the total present and the production rate, is the best option. 

You also do not have to put shades up in space, balloons tethered to the ground can be floated up to reflect light away just like the orbital shades. 

If these are infrared reflective on their top so much the better. 

Probably not a bad power generation method either. 

Probably cheaper than the orbital variety if you have to build on Earth too. 

Balloons need to be sturdier, thicker, more expensive to manufacture, but you save on the launch costs. 

If you’re building up in space probably the other way around. 

We also have some biological options too, especially if we open the door to genetic engineering though a lot of existing species will do the job with judicious usage, helping to control runoff and erosion. 

We discussed some of the more far out options for that in the Gene Tailoring and Bioforming episode and we’re running long on this episode so I’ll refer you there, but imagine for the moment being able to grow your seawalls or island by using plants to do carbon capture and use that to make the structures in question. 

But even if you’re building them out of concrete and steel you can still drop some dirt and plants over top them. 

It’s sort of like in the Arcologies and Ecumenpolises episodes, which this episode is pretty tied to, how we saw that a planet wide city wasn’t some smog filled hellhole covered in concrete and steel packed with a trillion people but rather a lot of forests not very packed with people at all, even though it would probably have a couple trillion of them, because it basically comes down to getting rid of heat and making the most use out of your energy before it turns into heat. 

Same thing today, we were just looking more at the planet then the places we’d live on it. 

Obviously a lot of these techniques discussed today won’t be practical for some time, maybe never. 

They all have consequences too, that’s what happens when you’re terraforming your own planet. 

The ethical issues for each I leave to you to consider, and you’re welcome to talk about them in the comments section below or over on the facebook group, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur. 

Next week we’ll be looking at Crazy Aliens, and unlike in the Stupid Aliens episode we won’t be discussing misconceptions about aliens from fiction but rather how many of things we’d think of as crazy might be normal to actual aliens or how they might view us as nuts, and each other too.

First Contact

So today we are continuing our look at alien civilizations by discussing the concept of first contact with an alien civilization. This is much too broad a topic for just one episode so we will be saving some concepts like language for future episodes. We will also be placing an emphasis today on a lot of the misconceptions of this idea from science fiction, continuing last week’s theme of stupid aliens. 

How such a first contact scenario goes down will depend a lot on their own psychology but we can’t know too much about that, just how certain qualities of the contact will impact logical actions. There are nine ways I could think of in which we might encounter aliens, in general terms, and here they are: 1. We’ve already met them They’ve been here before in the distant past, or are here now observing us or tinkering with our civilization. 2. We find their ruins We encounter an extinct species and are sifting through their ruins, contact is one way, us seeing them before they died. 3. We see signs of them from a distance Life, especially intelligent life, tends to leave a lot of telltales signs it exists. 

Here there’s no overt contact either way, but this is still contact and it’s probably the most likely form. 4. We encounter them in deep space This highly improbable scenario is popular in scifi. This is our first example where live two-way communication is possible, and probably the scenario most likely to result in violence, as the captain will be wondering why the ship is quietly approaching one of your planets. 5. We hear them by radio We hear them or they hear us, and we have plenty of time to decipher the message and reply if we choose to. 6. By Instant but Distant Communication Unlike the former, if we assume some sort of faster-than-light, or FTL, means of communication, this is our second form that allows real-time communication, but doesn’t appear to include danger or urgency, at least not at first glance. 7. We come to them Here we find some species who either does not yet have spaceflight or just doesn’t much use it, which makes a big difference. Once more real-time communication is possible. 

8. We meet them through a third party Probably one of the first questions you’d ask another alien civilization is if they know of anyone else, the answer could easily be yes and you would want the details about them, but would need to be worried about skewed perceptions or even outright lies. 9. They come to us Our last one, though probably the most common in fiction, is that an alien ship comes to us and makes contact, peaceful or not. I tend to like to save this for last when discussing this topic because so many of our misconceptions in regard to it come from not determining reasonable behavior in advance. Now before we jump into these we will make a few assumptions. We can’t be sure about any of these but they are all ones that ought to be true of nearly anyone we should encounter and odds are that any exceptions will be few and far between and we’d have met some other critters first who do follow our assumptions in order to get some practice doing it right before meeting oddballs. 

So what do we know? A given alien civilization was either designed by nature or by some intelligence, if the former they will be inclined toward survival and pretty good at it, evolution works on survival of the fittest and isn’t gentle with those who are neither fit nor interested in survival. If the latter, people made by someone else, it would seem likely they’d include self-preservation as a desire too. 

If we created an artificial intelligence that was designed to operate on some task autonomously, so that we weren’t present, we would include some self-preservation motivation. This might vary from minimal self-preservation to extreme. A robot that will cheerfully perform a suicidal task to one which would not even take a 1% chance of injury to save millions, but it will have something designed to preserve it. This could include organic lifeforms too, like a species created or modified heavily away from their natural form. 

Now I don’t include that self-preservation or autonomy on my toaster, but that’s because it is not meant to operate autonomously, it won’t be making first contact with aliens, I will be, unless they visit my home and mistakenly assume it is the dominant intelligent life form. For today’s purpose we are assuming the aliens are not stupid though, that’s our next assumption, they want to survive and they are clever. 

Such being the case they will not have identified my toaster as intelligent and me not as intelligent. 

You just have to be monumentally dense to miss the signs that Earth has intelligent tool-users on it, what with the radio &amp; TV signals, satellites in orbit, and all those mysteriously squared shaped rocks and trees with glass windows in them and wires and roads running to them. My toaster is not mobile, on first inspection they couldn’t distinguish it from my computer, microwave, or TV if it was off, and maybe they’d think it consumed bread. But my doorway’s size, its doorknob, all the handles and chairs and so on, including photos of friends and family on the walls, start to generate a picture. 

It’s one thing to mistake a stone axe for a natural object, stuff like the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland can incorrectly look artificial too, but it is another thing to mistake a garage and all the tools and vehicles in it for natural. 

So we can assume aliens are intelligent if they have technology, and we will recognize technology. More accurately we will recognize intelligence, intelligence knows intelligence. 

At least any type which will have technology, since that implies curiosity and a value for knowledge and a desire to use it to alter your environment to enhance survival. There may be exceptions to this, but I suspect not for reasons we’ll discuss in the future. 

Ditto, it is possible some species might evolve as natural spacefarers, around a collection of small moons for instance, but it is unlikely, so spacefaring means technology. And technology means they know math and science, which is the keystone of communication with them. To communicate with someone you need shared concepts, the only universal concepts are things like math and basic physical principles or things found Universe-wide. 

So technological civilizations, especially those who can explore space, will be survival-oriented, smart, curious, and clever. They will also recognize technology and know it means intelligence made it. This brings up another Stupid Aliens moment from classic science fiction, and from one of the best authors who normally does aliens amazingly well. Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card shows us an example of an accidental violent first contact situation between humanity and a race called the Buggers. In this case the aliens arrive in our solar system and attack and board our spaceships and kill crew members and eventually seriously damage China before their first expedition is defeated. 

They send a second one too which barely loses after a massive space battle in our solar system. Here’s the thing, afterwards the realization comes that the Buggers never realized we were intelligent because they’re really hive mind entities who communicate telepathically. We could never talk to them because they simply have no concept for language. Yet the implication is that the Buggers didn’t realize we were intelligent till after they failed to invade us twice, even though both times they encountered spaceships. It’s not hard to distinguish a spaceship from a meteor at a distance, and certainly not when one is boarding one and murdering its crew, so why would one ever think something that was clearly a spaceship was not the product of a highly intelligent species? It is still a great book series and one I highly recommend, and the author makes some attempt to fix that issue in later books. 

I suspect the mistake comes from him expanding a short story into that book as a pseudo-prequel to Speaker for the Dead, another great book which features quite clever aliens making another first contact screw-up with us which I won’t spoil. 

So let us go through our list of nine in order now and consider what is significant about each. This begins with case where we’ve already met them but basically did not know it. A classic staple of scifi is that aliens walk among us, or used to back in the old days. What their motivation for doing this activity might be varies a lot. Maybe they’re plotting a takeover, maybe they’re teaching us to build pyramids, maybe they’re doing some anthropology. I figure the assumption of curiosity in technological species makes anthropology a common field for their own past and probably one that would still apply to aliens. I have difficulty imagining our own anthropologists wouldn’t give their right arm and maybe a leg to study an alien civilization and that’s not likely to be limited to humans. Now for first contact we have a few specific things. First, it’s already happened, we just didn’t know about it as a species, maybe some of us did, maybe none did, maybe we misinterpreted it as gods or whichever, doesn’t matter. Second, it means they already have an advanced knowledge of us including our language and customs, so the responsibility is entirely on them not screw up that first contact. It’s not an excuse for us to be jerks or idiots, but we don’t know much whereas they do. Third, we certainly have a right to ask why they were here without formally revealing themselves and to expect a good answer. They also don’t have a right to be shocked by that since they should know our own psychology, so they ought to have a good logical reason ready. When contemplating those it’s important to do a role reversal and ask how we’d respond to people we’d been monitoring or overtly interacting with in the distant past. From a realistic perspective you don’t need to land on a planet that already has TV and radio to learn enough about them to talk, and also whoever you send down is likely to be an android. It’s a lot safer to remotely pilot a robot body from orbit configured to look like the native life. Not necessarily a person, a bird or dog or whatever is probably your best first bet. 

The elephant in the room is privacy, because you are spying on people, those being spied on or doing the spying might not care about that as much as us but probably more importantly curious species, even those that care about privacy a lot, will recognize both the desire for knowledge and the legit concern of not wanting to screw up a first meeting or interacting with the unknown. Even with a technological advantage on my side I’d still rather not make friends with a race that is fanatically xenophobic and thinks Hitler would have been a great guy if he didn’t have the fault of being a dirty filthy human. Particularly since I would be expecting one of the first questions aliens would ask would be “Will you share some of your technology with us?” and I’d have a problem saying no. I’d also have a problem justifying observations that lasted generations. This also raises the question of who you contact, because you know enough to be selective. Do you contact a government? All of them? If not how many and which ones? Do you call the news and say you want to do an interview on TV and just hover your ship next to their broadcast studio so they know it isn’t a joke? There’s probably a right and wrong way to do this but I’d probably go the open route from day 1, just relying on what we could hear by radio and TV for the basics and broadcasting my hello on English on all the channels. Total honesty, here we are, we’re friendly, we’ve got some technology we’ll share but not all of it right away, and that we want permission for a small outpost on the moon or similar, a 100 year lease on some spot in exchange for some spaceflight technologies. Things are a different if we come across ruins of a civilization. Everything is archeology now and we have plenty of time to be cautious. 

Both to avoid damaging stuff and in terms of whatever wiped them out. Killing off a technological civilization is quite tricky as we’ve discussed before so unless the method is obvious it behooves you to be cautious while digging around. Whatever killed them off might be a factor, and it could be something weird too like some existential crisis that induced depression and nihilism, not some overt doomsday device. 

This does have a special case too. You see they might all be dead but that does necessarily matter. We can’t rule out that they might have had some bunkers that didn’t just include archives but frozen people too, but more to the point, it does not require any ridiculously advanced technology to find some DNA, possibly even just digital copies of it in such an archive, and grow a person. Or persons, or all their extinct species too. We’ve discussed that as a last resort option for environmental damage in the past, keeps frozen or digital DNA of extinct species for future resurrection when we’ve dealt with whatever ecological issues made it occur before. I think we would certainly want to uncover and preserve an alien species civilization if we found their ruins, but what about actually recreating them and their world? That’s not a first contact case of course, we would probably have to raise their first generation or two of kids so they would definitely know us and not really be the original civilization, though I suppose we could trick them by pretending to be them. I don’t recall any scifi covering such a scenario so it’s probably a pretty fertile ground for some, but from our perspective it is an interesting moral conundrum. Do you resurrect a planet if you can? And if you can, how do you do it? In secret or just tell the young new aliens the whole story, you killed yourselves off, we cloned you, we taught you, we brought you back and restored you. And can you imagine if someone showed up here one day and told us they had done that for us? 

Now our next case isn’t contact either. It’s the notion that we see them from a distance, not communicate with them at all. This is our most likely way to become aware of alien civilizations too. Odds are the first life we find will come after we’ve detected indicators of it from back home here. For non-intelligent life, or at least ones not up to the point of doing TV and radio signals, we might detect a planet with an oxygen rich atmosphere, which is not conclusive indication of life but is a strong indicator. 

Oxygen doesn’t like to stick around as a gas, it bonds to make rocks or water instead, so large amounts of it imply something is either preventing that or constantly making a new supply of molecular oxygen. Photosynthesis does that but not much else does, not that would be present in such large quantities as to keep an entire atmosphere oxygen rich. 

At the bigger scale, we’re not really looking for radio signals in SETI anymore. Or we still do but not many expected that to work and decades of nothing much have sharpened that viewpoint. The better route is looking for folks who have been building dyson swarms. 

First it indicates they are probably still around, since that implies they survived as a species long enough to engage in major space exploitation and that they are way less vulnerable to species obliteration now that they are spread out around their solar system. Even a now extinct species interest us, but looking for a long-lasting one increases the odds of finding them not only alive but at all, since they’re showing signs of their existence for longer. Second it can be seen a lot further away. 

There’s no maximum range on detecting radio and TV signals, if you build a large enough telescope, but as a rule people don’t broadcast louder than they have to and a signal meant to be heard elsewhere on your own planet doesn’t need to be nearly as strong as one meant to be heard by the same antenna on another planet. Hundreds of kilometers away not hundred of light years, and there are about 10 trillion kilometers in a light year, and signals weaken inverse square to distance, so 100 trillion, trillion times weaker. Actually not as much since the big thing interfering with signals on Earth is the planet and atmosphere so it is easier to hear some signals over on the moon then the other side of the planet but that’s not too important today. Great big Kardashev-2 civilizations can get away with building telescopes that could pick up our TV broadcasts thousands of light years away, but they themselves are quite visible from all the light they are blocking and re-emitting as infrared, something we’ve discussed a lot in the Fermi Paradox episodes. Those ought to be detectable anywhere inside our own galaxy with modern equipment if we’re looking at them. More importantly a species building those up around many stars as they colonize their galaxy will be visible at extra-galactic distances. 

You can look at places, even whole galaxies and see if they emit too much infrared basically. 

Or too much radio. Even if you cannot figure what they are saying because it’s encrypted or you just can’t understand it you could see it going on. You can also look for signs of spaceships, some types of propulsion would be highly distinct and visible. We can’t talk to them, by listening anyway, we can send signals ourselves now, but we can being listening more closely to a candidate and begin drawing conclusions from what we can see. This gives you a much larger range to examine and since space is a volume, every time you widen your range by a factor of 10 you increase the possible targets by 10³ or a thousand. If we figure the nearest civilization is a thousand light years from us, we’d expect several more just a little bit further away in the other directions and we’d expect a thousand times as many within 10,000 light years. You might only be able to hear radio a thousand light years away but you could detect a Dyson swarm a lot further away. This raises another interesting point that applies to first contact because we always have three pieces of knowledge available the moment we meet or see aliens. The first is that they exist, but the second is that others do or did, because if we find one just a thousand light years away it strongly implies our galaxy would contain many thousands more. There’s around a million stars within a thousand light years of us and that implies technological civilization are about 1 in a million systems at least if you find another that close to us, there a few hundred billion stars in our galaxy and 1 in a million would mean a few hundred thousand civilizations. 

A conclusion that other alien civilization will now also draw if they hadn’t already met someone else, if they have they can refine that number down a lot more too. But that’s the third thing, they now know the galaxy is pretty cluttered with civilizations if they didn’t already. And that changes the dynamics of first contact, because you’d have good reason to believe other critters might be watching or find out later what you did. So if you’re thinking about genocide you either have to wonder if folks who disapprove of that might see you doing it, and conclude that they probably will see it, or consider that they might not disapprove because it’s what they’d do, in which case an alliance with the intended victim against some big genocidal badass might be in order. And the Universe doesn’t end at the edge of the galaxy either, other galaxies aren’t spaced out like stars are, galaxies are more like small continents with lots of islands in between them, so intergalactic colonization and warfare is viable. Key point is, anything you do in space to another species you are probably doing for a live studio audience and the folks doing it will know that, so it will effect first contact, especially since it will probably be at their planet which is probably monitored by others, and those monitors might have gotten to like the folks they’ve been watching and so probably won’t frame you in the kindest light if they are reporting to their superiors that some hostile race just blew them to smithereens. 

If you do run into another species in Deep Space it is less likely to be seen by others because monitoring a whole galaxy is a whole different story then monitoring every solar system in it. Of course if you do bump into another ship while traveling between the stars it is almost guaranteed that they are headed to whichever system you left and coming from whichever one you are headed towards. This pretty much necessitates you both stop and talk, which is a problem since you probably need at least weeks to actually slow down and you probably need to slow down to arrive at some chunk of rock and ice you can refuel off of. Space is just too huge for such a passage in the night to occur otherwise and it will be very obvious to both parties where you are headed and where you’re coming from. 

They probably will stop too. If they’re explorers, they’ve just found something worth exploring. If they are colonists, they will want to know if that destination is now occupied. If they are invaders they will know they’ve been exposed. They can’t just blow you up either because you’d be transmitting home all the time anyway and even if you don’t have a constant signal home, which you would, they’d have to assume you would transmit once you detected them or have a black box designed to. A lot of interstellar ships would have thin tethers running behind them, or off to the side, to expand their view for detection, hard to spot such a thing till you’re closer enough you’d be spotted for sure too. Interstellar spaceships are not terribly covert objects even when they aren’t firing their engines. Which they’d do fairly often incidentally. 

We’ve never discussed it in any episodes for time constraints but if you saw the space warfare episode you know the best defense against laser weapons, which are the fastest allowed by known physics, is to make the occasional small course correction. It doesn’t have to be much or use much fuel, you just pick a random direction and apply a little thrust. 

A change of just a meter per second will mean someone a light day away won’t know your position to better than a couple hundred kilometers, and when you’re moving millions of meters a second doing a tiny thrust change like that every day is a minor fuel expense and a good diagnostic to make sure your engines are still working. We also didn’t mention that every interstellar ship has a battery of laser weapons on it that would intimidate modern major nation states. You need those to be able to vaporize any chunk of debris too small to see soon enough to dodge around. Those need to be powerful and automated, they also need to be guided by some very intense and active radar systems which won’t be terribly subtle either. 

You have to have such things on your ship and you have an obligation to make sure they don’t shoot other ships. In the classic Scifi novel the Mote in God’s Eye we get an example of that. Here a solar sail ship shows up in a human colonized system and opens fire on the ship that approaches it transmitting hellos. This results in a reply that accidentally kills the lone occupant of the ship. The chief scientist for the system is enraged at the response to what he assumes was an automatic anti-meteor defense, but later an officer from that ship uses an analogy to point out that you have an ethical obligation to design any anti-meteor defenses not to open fire on neutral third parties. Now you might say how could they know how to identify one but a spaceship and a meteor do not appear even a little bit alike. Wrong speed, wrong shape, wrong heat signature, even if it is not spewing out megawatts of active radar. If you make an automated weapon you clearly do have an ethical obligation to make sure the odds of it targeting someone it should not are kept to a minimum. And you know it could be a problem because you have to start with interplanetary ships in your own system which also need anti-meteor lasers. All your ships probably have some sort of IFF friend or foe signals but you still have to worry about those breaking or getting jammed so you’d always want a backup in the targeting system itself that knew some characteristics ships had and meteors had which the other generally does not and won’t shoot without an override command if an object is clearly not a meteor. It is very hard not to realize a spaceship is a spaceship and not a meteor, and you ought to be able to tell a machine how to figure out which is which. Common sense methods besides shape include it emitting radiation, like radio waves and infrared heat, and moving at the wrong speed for random objects. If you can’t do that maybe you should delay interstellar travel until you can, but it’s not rocket science to recognize a rocket ship. Well, I mean it kind of is rocket science or implies you know rocket science anyway, bad analogy. 

Again intelligence can recognize intelligence. Two ships in deep space that see each other and see that their point of departure is the other guy’s point of arrival are probably going to want to heave to and talk and they will want to start doing so long before they pass each other, in large part because they know if they don’t start by then the other guy is going to seriously consider opening fire on them or using whatever rock they planned to refuel at anyway as the gas station and hardware store to cannon up and chase you back to their home, where there will probably be a big fleet waiting to beat you up since they probably will get the message you are coming years before your ship arrives. 

So you probably do decelerate and either both settle onto one icy rock somewhere between your ships or each your own some reasonable distance apart so you can chat by radio. There will plenty of these, interstellar space is huge and mostly empty but there are still tons of icy rocks in it, even big ones, that’s why they need the lasers and thrusters. The rock is fuel by the way, or rather the ice is, interstellar ships either run on hydrogen or one of its isotopes or can if they need to, unless it’s a fission rocket in which case you will be able to tell it is and you won’t regard that as a huge threat, even if that’s what you’ve got, and neither of you is stopping or turning around. Instead you’re both expecting to arrive at inhabited systems at the total mercy of its inhabitants, so exchanging a lot of radio talk between ships while you can is a good idea. 

These will be a lot shorter and faster than exchanging signals between planets hundreds or thousands of light years apart. That’s our next category and kind of the classic SETI case. There’s not much to say about this. There’s really no contact here either because you can’t ask questions, you send big blocks of data, probably constantly, or receive it, and you’ve got all the time in the world to decipher them because spending a few years doing so barely adds to the time lag. You’d mostly have to decide if you wanted to reply right away or not, if you decide to do so they obvious method is to just repeat their signal back to them, probably with a follow up or minor modification like flipping all the digits so it was definitely a transmission not a reflection. That tells them that you are interested in talking but don’t know how yet, so they will keep their eyes open figuring you are trying to decipher their language. 

Of course they won’t get even that mirror reply till twice as long as the distance between you, send a message to a planet a hundred light years away and don’t expect any reply for at least 200 years. You’d also guess they might not immediately reply even with a mirror transmission so it’s a good idea to watch for a while once the minimum time has passed. You should also start listening sooner too in case they have some outpost nearer to you that replied sooner. Now we always have to consider the option they’ve figured out faster than light communication, I sincerely doubt we will ever figure that one out but if we did it is like the last case in terms of distance only. You need to communicate more real-time, which opens the door for accidents, and you’re not safe either. The ability to communicate FTL implies the ability to send matter or energy that way too. Not necessarily a lot of matter either, transmitting a small biological virus or nanomachine that can replicate is all you need to do. The latter can just grey goo a planet or build its own FTL communicator home and build an army on site. Or maybe they can just send a huge energy beam that way. Interesting invasion technique too, if the communicator has to be built on the other side to send anything, you transmit the blueprints to build an FTL radio by classic radio and when someone picks up to say hi, out pops your invasion and colonization crews. Our next option is that we visit them and make contact. That implies we are the more technologically advanced or if not that they are a Stay-at-Home Civilization, something we discussed last month. For the latter your big concern is how they view visitors, and uninvited visitors at that, considering a technologically advanced species shouldn’t be first contacted in person that way. You might dispatch a ship right behind your own first communications to expedite dialogue but it should get there later than the message and that message presumably included telling them you were sending a ship which would turn back if they asked it to. 

As to a non-advanced species, like us contacting ourselves back in antiquity, we have the option of either just landing and saying hi or going through the various anthropological options we discussed earlier. Alien biology not being compatible with our own, in all likelihood, we would not just want to land and get out, exposing us and them to all our germs and theirs. I’d survey from above for signs of intelligence, those can be visible from orbit like pyramids or canals. After observing what we can from low orbit telescopes I’d drop drones far away from any signs of civilization and do some observing, even if just to find out what sort of local fauna there is and how it behaves so I can send more drones concealed as those for close observation. Why are doing this? Because we have all the cards and so also have an obligation to come in with a good amount of knowledge so we don’t mess up. An obligation big enough to justify what I regard as committing a fairly serious crime of invading those people’s privacy. I’m going to be wanting to learn the languages and customs so I know how to apologize and compensate those folks for spying on them, which is another reason I wouldn’t approve of prolonged observations that took generations. 

A lot of science fiction encourages us to respect primitive alien cultures and not interfere with them, I understand the logic and partially agree, but I’ve never quite understood the logic behind it being okay to spy on them. I justify it by trying to learn as much as we can quickly so we can talk to them as equals, just ones who have less technology, something we can offer to show them and teach them to improve their lives. Spying on people just to satisfy your curiosity about them is a very dubious ethical position. Were it a totally safe one it would mean reading people’s emails was just fine so long as you didn’t get caught and they never found out. When encountering the unknown you have a certain obligation, to both your people and that unknown, to be decently well-prepared. That justifies some limited spying because it reduces the risk to all parties, but it doesn’t just make it okay either. The obligation is greater on you because you have more tools and knowledge on your side. Same reason if you’re a doctor present at an accident you’re the one expected to try to fix the injured people, and why it’s okay to dig through their wallet or cellphone to see if they’ve got any existing conditions that might be relevant. This is also why even if you don’t think you are likely to encounter any aliens with some colony ship you send out you still have an obligation to have designed a first contact protocol and made sure the captain knows of it, even if it is just knowing one exists and the name of the file. For our next case we have the example of meeting people through a third party. We already met some aliens and we asked them if they knew any others. If they say yes then we ought to ask them for the relevant information like languages and protocols. In the 1990s Scifi TV series Babylon 5 we get an example of a first contact situation that went bad, ending with us firing on alien ships, the Minbari, and killing their leader. This leads to them trying to commit genocide against us. The details were left vague till some years later when they did a made-for-TV movie on it and they fill in the blanks, badly too. We get details on them from another race and later on yet another race has an ambassador who fatally obliterates the plot by casually offering to help negotiate at a secret summit since he is fluent in both Human and Minbari Languages. Up until that moment there was at least a vague hope that prior contact of everyone involved hadn’t involved communication. I’ll skip the details but the entire incident occurs because of neither side, including the one who has been spacefaring and in contact with aliens for at least a thousand years, having any language files for other species who both have come into contact with. There’s blame to spread around but it mostly falls on the alien Minbari here, since they had the advantages. This applies to their actions afterwards too, since when you know you have the tech and firepower edge and you know they knew it too, you should guess that if they shot at you and ran away they probably were spooked into doing it, not trying to provoke a conflict they’d know they’d lose. 

This brings us to our last case, where the aliens come and visit us. 

It is quite common in fiction to have the aliens do something that spooks human into some response then afterwards condemns our rash actions. There’s an episode of the Outer Limits, the 1990’s incarnation, titled “Trial by Fire” where a newly sworn in president has to deal with an approaching object traveling at half the speed of light. 

This object barely misses Earth and crashes into the moon instead, needless to say doing huge amounts of damage. After a moment of celebration at this narrowly avoided doom the astronomers inform the president that they’ve detected a fleet of alien ships. 

They also hit one of our satellites with an energy pulse that disables it. Bad clichés ensue. The scientists argue the pulse disabling the satellite was probably an accident, the president’s wife tries to convince him of the alien peaceful intent. The generals encourage him to assume it is an invasion and nuke them. The aliens are repeating a signal we can’t translate. The scientists realize that the object that hit the moon was an infinite power source and argue it was meant to be a gift, not a weapon. 

The president transmits a message welcoming the aliens to Earth but insisting they stay in Orbit for the time being. One of the ships lands in the ocean anyway, gets fired on by the Russians, and it destroys the ships. We deploy a nuke against the alien fleet, it fails and they launch two objects at Moscow and DC. Just before those arrive they translate the message finally, realizing it was in English all along but distorted by the aliens speaking inside water, and it says “Let us be your friends”, the president and his wife mournfully embrace before being incinerated. I’m not quite sure what the moral of the story is, but if an Earth Fleet did that and their commander came back telling me about it I’d have the incompetent fool shot. The moral of the story is supposed to be that we screwed up and provoked the aliens, in reality the aliens were absolute morons. They understand English, meaning they were listening to our radio signals, meaning they know exactly how we communicate. They would know which bands of radio to transmit on and exactly how much power to send that transmission with so that their message, in perfectly understandable English, would show up on everyone’s TVs and radios. 

That’s the big take away for First Contact, one side is almost always at a knowledge advantage. 

No ship has any business arriving here without already knowing our language because we’ve been sending it out for decades and they should have spent decades listening to it on the way here and deciphering it. Honestly even if their computers are no better than ours are now they ought not need long to figure it out with the sheer quantity of signals we’ve produced in the last century. So anyone coming here should know our language already. This is one of the reasons, the other being time, that we’re not doing alien languages today, only for the example of two ships running into each other in deep space – which is frankly highly improbable – should you ever have a case where one of the parties hadn’t had plenty of time to learn and get comfortable with the language first. We could, and probably will, do an episode on deciphering alien signals or how we should send our own, but in short form its all math and physics, because those are the only guaranteed shared concepts of technological civilizations. If they come from our own universe anyway, folks dialing us up from some higher dimension where they don’t have gravity or stars or even atoms might be a different story. Something we’ll discuss another time. For now the key concept is that in all probability first contact will always occur twice, the first time when Species A finds out B exists and spends time deciphering their language, and the second time when B finds out A exists because Species A sends them a formal greeting in their own language. We’ve still got tons of stuff to cover but that will finish us up for the day. Next week we will be looking at Weather Control and GeoEngineering concepts, essentially how to Terraform our own planet. The week after that we’ll return to the Alien Civilizations series to look at Crazy Aliens, and unlike last week’s episode on stupid aliens, this time we won’t be look at our misconceptions from fiction but instead how actual aliens might have behaviors we’d view as nuts or vice-versa. This will be our first attempt to genuinely look inside a hypothetical alien mind. A couple quick announcements before we end for the day. First, all the episodes come with captions as you know, but mostly in English, we’ve had volunteers who have kindly translated many of the episodes into other languages, and I want to thank them, but we’re always looking for more and if you’re bilingual and interested in trying your hand at one, let me know in the comments below where I’ll also leave some explanations pinned at the top of the comments secion. Second, since I haven’t announced it in a while, all episodes are also available for free audio download over on soundcloud, and I always include a link to those in the episode description. Some folks prefer to listen to these when driving and I try to accommodate that. I always post two versions, one with music and one without. Okay, announcements complete, again next week is Weather Control and GeoEngineering. To get alerts when that and other episodes come out, make sure to subscribe to the channel. If you enjoyed this episode, make sure to like it and share it with others. Until next time, thanks for watching, and have a great week!

Stupid Aliens
---

Only in Hollywood can an alien armada cross the vastness of interstellar space, in ships the size of mountains, yet be dumb enough not to install anti-virus software. 

So today we begin Year 3 of Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, and I am your host, the aforementioned Isaac Arthur. 

If you are new to the channel, possibly having clicked on the somewhat click-bait-ey episode title of Stupid Aliens, there are a couple things you should know coming in. 

First, I don’t have an accent, it is a speech impediment, I have problems pronounce the letter R, as in Rascally Rabbits. 

For that reason, every episode includes closed captions subtitles you can turn on. 

Second, this channel does very in-depth looks at topics, the average run-time tends to be about 20-40 minutes, so it is usually a good idea to grab a drink and snack beforehand. 

One of our major topics for this year is going to be contemplating and discussing what alien civilizations might be like. 

This is a tricky topic because there are not many things we can predict about alien civilizations, especially that would tend to be universal traits to all alien civilizations. 

We can say for instance that they are very likely to value knowledge, at least if they are technologically advanced spacefarers, because it is hard to travel in space without technology, a lot of it, and it’s hard to have that without valuing knowledge. 

We can’t be sure that would be a universal trait with no exceptions, but it ought to be common one. 

Alternatively there are a lot things we can say ought to be uncommon, that we would not expect to encounter much in alien civilizations, basically because it is stupid. 

Sadly we have an awful lot of these in science fiction. 

Aliens who are technologically advanced but fundamentally stupid. 

The film Independence Day is a well-known example, aliens smart enough to construct and maintain a massive interstellar fleet but incapable of dealing with a simple computer virus. 

Now to be fair, any solution to any alien invasion is going to have to be a headscratcher that needs a lot of suspension of disbelief by the audience, because there isn’t one. 

If an alien armada shows up in orbit of Earth with the intent of killing us, especially if they don’t care about preserving the ecology and can use a Scorched Earth strategy, we will lose. 

Quickly too. 

No ship able to get itself up to near light speed lacks the energy to just torch the surface of a planet, and any technology that allowed them to circumvent those energy needs would have a weaponizable component that permitted the same thing. 

Your typical interstellar craft ought to have energy supplies that let it shoot nukes at a planet like it was bullets from a machinegun. 

If they want the planet intact they whack it with a targeted virus that just kills humans or just dump tons of nerve gas down from orbit. 

So the writers have to take some liberties if they want to do a story about an alien invasion, unless it is intended to be a black comedy, and a short one at that. 

Unfortunately we tend to absorb that, folks don’t realize it is flawed or if they do, it still wriggles its way into the brain by repetition. 

Now our focus today is not on Invading Earth but we will start with that. 

There are basically 4 reasons to visit Earth if you are aliens that I can think of and here they are: 1) To talk with us and get to know each other 2) To get our planet’s raw materials 3) To obliterate us 4) To acquire things unique to Earth Now the first one, that they want to talk with us, we will look at next week in the First Contact episode, though there are a lot of popular ideas for how that would go down that imply the aliens are pretty stupid too. 

Starting with the notion that after encountering them at random face-to-face, which ought to never happen, they’d misunderstand us and open fire. 

We’ll do that next time, but just to continue the theme for today, if you are an advanced alien species and you show up on doorstep uninvited hoping to have a conversation, the onus is on you to do some basic research first about language, customs, and psychology. 

We certainly would, and we broadcast tons of TV and radio they could listen to first. 

The second one is Earth’s raw materials. 

Problem is that Earth does not have any raw materials that are not more abundant and more easily accessible elsewhere. 

Clearly no one is going around strip mining our area of the galaxy or we wouldn’t be able to planets around other nearby stars, heck we shouldn’t be able to see any stars if they were doing that, considering what we looked at in the Star Lifting and Dyson Dilemma episodes. 

There ought to be a chunk of the sky where there are very few stars and some visibly disappearing in recent centuries if someone is doing that and about to arrive here as the edge of an expanding sphere of mining activity. 

A few years back the movie Oblivion came out, and it was a pretty decent film, but in that the aliens had gone through an elaborate and unnecessarily stupid effort in order to get an even stupider prize. 

They were mining Earth for it water, sucking the oceans clean. 

Apparently for the hydrogen which is even sillier, since hydrogen is the most abundant thing in the Universe. 

Earth is not the best place to get hydrogen from, as it has way less than the gas giants and also a much steeper gravity well then all the comets and small icy bodies on the periphery of the solar system. 

Anyone who just needed that much hydrogen ought to be leaving behind a Dark Sky in its wake because they clearly want all of it. 

The same is true of any raw material, metals, oxygen, etc. 

Earth would not be your last stop to find those things but there are so many better ones that you’d have to be a moron to come here before you exhausted all of those other easier sources and it would be blisteringly obvious if someone was doing that. 

It would be like people living in the Sahara desert invading Australia to steal sand from their beaches. 

The third reason is to obliterate us and that’s actually the most logical. 

They don’t care about our resources they just want us dead, maybe they don’t want the competition for the galaxy and kill that off before it gets advanced. 

Maybe they just don’t like us specifically. 

I already discussed how easy that is to do without ever landing and we’ve talked about weapons before, like the Nicoll-Dyson Beam or Relativistic Kill Missiles, that would make it so you didn’t even have to come into the solar system but could instead commit genocide from the comfort of your own homeworld. 

The last one though is that there is something unique about Earth they want, and that presumably needs to be life itself or something made by life. 

This is science though not a comic book so Galactus isn’t going to show up to suck out our life energy, we haven’t got any. 

There’s not going to be any space vampires that feed on humans draining away their life essence and leaving them old withered husks. 

For the sake of fiction we could assume maybe they want to eat our souls or something. 

I mean I like to think I have a soul, that would be neat, but I never seen much evidence for that let alone anything definitive, and I’d really hate to get definitive evidence of that from Cthulu showing up saying he’d like to eat mine. 

As to non-supernatural options, what have we got? 

You can rule out that they want to eat humans, even if their biochemistry allowed them to digest us humans are an awful source of meat, and they could just grow us in a lab. 

I mean if I were an alien species who developed a freaky fondness for the taste of people I’d just ask for a sample of our DNA to help humanity research medicine, then use that to clone up some long-pig back at my homeworld of Cannibala 3 in the Gastronomy Sector. 

Everything on Earth can be replicated, so you don’t need to harvest people or cows or trees, you just come by and ask for two of every animal, or maybe a dozen or so for the genetic diversity, and you wouldn’t need or want to keep them just take a sample so you could get their DNA. 

You don’t even need big freezer banks to store that in, not that even a billion samples of DNA takes up much space, because you could just record the sequence digitally and print it back home. 

Faster that way too, a digital recording of DNA can travel at light speed, a frozen sample cannot, and they are the same thing. 

Your DNA is not physical, any more than a book is, it is a sequence of information whether its on a hard drive, a paper printout, or a clay tablet. 

If you’ve got that you can build yourself some rotating habitats back around some star you own and fill them up Earth-life as a nature preserve, or a farm, whatever your civilization is into. 

The same applies for our art and literature, unless you’ve got some weird Collector complex that requires you have the original copy of everything or the only copy, you could just ask and we would give up copies of all our music and TV and such. 

I suppose they might be coming by to obliterate our art, but even as bad as Reality TV is I have difficulty believing anyone would invade us just to destroy that. 

They could offer it in trade for technology, or just demand it at gunpoint, though the former would seem more logical. 

If you are species that will spend centuries cruising to other planets to acquire their genetic diversity or art it kind of implies you aren’t the genocidal types. 

The other common one is they want to stop humanity destroying our own environment, which is usually based on insane-troll-logic. 

Humans damage our own environment mostly because we are trying to survive. 

We burn fossil fuels because we have nothing better, we knock over forests to grow food, there are not many people who get kicks out damaging the environment outside of the strawman villains from stuff like Captain Planet. 

In the 2008 remake of the Day the Earth Stood Still we get an example of that. 

They don’t like how we’ve treated our environment, fair enough, most of us don’t either, and both their means of arrival and punishment are things whose very existence allows them to easily fix the problem. 

I would love to see film or show sometime where the aliens show up, notice the environmental damage, and just shrug and say ‘yeah we had the same problems, here’s some technology that will fix that, and if you’ve got samples from any extinct species we can help you clone them back up too.’ If aliens show up here to lecture us on not burning fossil fuels, that had better be followed five seconds later by them saying ‘oh, yeah, we also brought you blueprints for these easy to build fusion power plants, like the one on our ship and back on our homeworld, Smugness 4 in the Self-Righteousness Sector.’ Of course this invokes the notion that they might not want to give us their technology because we are not ready for it yet and might destroy ourselves, which seems like pretty strange logic when you have just shown up to express your dismay about how we are destroying ourselves already. 

I’d really like to meet the jerk who would go to third world village, point out that they have contaminated drinking water as a result of their farming and sanitation methods, but then refuse to share with them the blueprints for the various water purifiers we have on the grounds that the technology might destroy them. 

That’s another example of Stupid Aliens, with the invasion options complete, or arguably Hypocritical Aliens or downright Evil Aliens. 

We all get the reason why you handing people dangerous technology isn’t such a good idea, the problem is the specific justification is pretty bad. 

I did not invent the Atomic Bomb, neither did you, neither in all likelihood did the alien who shows up talking about how dangerous they are. 

We all three of us know how dangerous they are. 

Lots of scifi writers advance the ‘too dangerous’ philosophy, but I can’t recall any of them that were actual scientists, though I’d imagine some are. 

From my own anecdotal observations the writers who tend to have strong science backgrounds generally think more science is good, even if it was acquired from aliens rather than invented by us. 

Probably because it occurs to them that it does not matter who discovered it, alien or human, because the other 7 billion humans did not. 

You don’t have to be a physicist or optometrist to know better than to shine a laser pointer in people’s eye, and you don’t have to have an advanced knowledge of viruses to know not to juggle fragile test tubes labeled Ebola over a concrete floor. 

The upshot of being a scientists is you are pretty much always surrounded by folks who use stuff from your field that you know they do not understand, and that you also used to not understand, and yet they are using it safely and so did you back when you didn’t. 

That and it makes you acutely aware of how many critical components of your own civilizations operate using technology you don’t even vaguely understand either. 

Or other aspects of knowledge, not everything is technology. 

There probably are technologies our minds can’t handle, but odds are neither could the original alien brains of that civilization and they can handle them now because they cyborged up their brains, which would presumably work just fine for us too. 

You certainly don’t invade a planet for slave labor, not if your goal is actual labor anyway, that’s what robots are for. 

If you just like conquering people and oppressing them because you are a bit of Ming the Merciless or Emperor Palpatine sort, then yeah it makes sense. 

Of course you might stop by Earth because you need an army, and humans are aggressive and warlike and your species is much too enlightened for that. 

I’m fairly sure removing the ability to defend yourselves from your species does qualify as stupid, especially if you went so far with it you can’t even make robots to do your actual fighting for you. 

These are presumably the same aliens that huddle on their homeworld quietly for eons in a row, I could see that. 

An occasional answer to the Fermi Paradox about where all the aliens are is that everyone is afraid that if they send out signals some big bad space monster is going to come by and eat their homeworld. 

Not an unreasonable fear on face value, but quite stupid. 

As we’ve discussed before, the cat is out of the bag about your civilization the moment you broadcast your first radio signals, there’s no point being silent after that. 

If you are planning to build a secret bunker on the outskirts of town, it’s not a good idea to use heavy machinery and dynamite in the excavation process. 

Nobody is going to miss you doing that or forget you did it. 

So you might as well build your civilization up so it can have a lot more scientists discovering a lot more fancy weaponry you can put on all your many, many ships constructed around your many, many planets and space stations. 

Of course the genocidal aliens are always stupid too. 

I have no idea why they opt to linger in the dark spaces between solar systems and galaxies in the first place, I mean beyond the obvious Lovecraftian overtones of scary ancient hungry monsters. 

If I had an enormous irresistible armada and was trying to destroy all life in the galaxy, I’d have them spend their free time swinging by planets every few million years to sterilize them. 

Or better yet just cannibalize the planets to make more ships in my armada. 

I certainly would not wait for intelligence to develop, let alone radio signals. 

I mean all those roads and canals and pyramids we built thousands of years ago already are quite visible from orbit. 

So if I did want to have my extermination fleet sleeping in between purges for some reason, I just park them around planets instead of the cold depths of space. 

Or even on the planet, just waking up every few thousand years to eyeball their environment for signs of intelligence. 

I probably would put them to sleep in between exterminations though, it would help to avoid their ethics mutating while they are sitting around with nothing to do but think about whether or not genocide was a good career choice. 

Pretty stupid hobby anyway, I’m never clear exactly why any of the critters want to wipe out all intelligent life. 

They obviously do not want all the raw materials in the galaxy for themselves, a full blown genuine galactic empire, a Kardashev 3 civilization, something we looked at last year, takes very little time to setup in the grand scheme of things and definitely prevents new life arising on planets since by default you don’t have any planets in a K3 civilization. 

I mean to a K3 civilization a planet just look like a giant lumber store, it’s not a place you live, its place you go pick up material to build places to live. 

And any given one of those trillions of planets in this galaxy has enough raw materials in it to construct not just a big ship for each solar system in the galaxy, but a pretty impressive fleet for each one. 

There’s enough iron in Earth alone to make several hundred trillion aircraft carrier sized ships. 

And you want big ships, that way you can include a robust IT department to prevent you from having your fleet destroyed by a computer virus made by a bunch of primitives who just invented computers in the last century. 

I’m just going to skip over any examples of aliens who travel across the length of galaxy for no other apparent purpose but to abduct people and probe their rectums. 

Perhaps proctology is a much more scientifically useful field than I assume. 

There’s a few of these examples I want to save for next week’s episode since they are great examples of stupid aliens but specifically in first contact situations. 

Like the Minbari from Babylon 5, who apparently think the best approach to greeting people is to wave a gun around while shining a flashlight in their eyes. 

Or the Buggers from Ender’s Game, who apparently believed functioning spaceships were not a sign of intelligence. 

Both are explained as tragic misunderstandings that resulted in attempted genocide against humanity. 

We’ll look at those next week. 

But one that comes to mind for today is aliens that wipe themselves out. 

I think the classic example of this is from the Forbidden Planet. 

This 1956 film helped make science fiction movies something other than low-budget B-movies they’d always been until then, and is still a great film even today, so if you haven’t seen it, prepare for spoilers. 

The movie features an alien race, the Krell, or rather a machine they built as they have gone extinct, from their own stupidity too which is ironic since they actually had a device that could boost intelligence. 

In spite of that they built a giant machine that could give physical form to their very thoughts. 

Apparently no one stopped to consider that our thoughts include a lot of very nasty subconscious demons and nightmares. 

The Krell were exterminated by their own subconscious thoughts in less than 24 hours. 

We get something similar from the most recent Superman reboot, the Man of Steel. 

I don’t mean the invasion plot itself, of needlessly picking a fight with Superman and humanity when their giant terraforming machine ought to have worked just as well on Mars or Venus. 

I mean more my surprise that they could even build a terraforming machine when in this incarnation of the destruction of Planet Krypton it was done by them over-mining their own planet core till the planet exploded… I also have no idea how such a thing would be possible, digging holes in a planet generally does not make them explode. 

Of course maybe they had long since converted their home planet into a shellworld, a concept we discussed early last year, but if they had it shouldn’t have been a civilization ending event, since you only do something like that to supply raw materials for construction of a Dyson Swarm, which kind of implies your home planet is just a very small if very significant chunk of your solar system’s population. 

You get similar examples with civilizations that wipe themselves out from cloning fatigue, as we saw happen to the Asgard in Stargate, or the Mariposans from the Star Trek: the Next Generation Episode up the Long Ladder, one of the worst episodes of the series. 

Ignoring for the moment that it should not be tricky to keep original samples of DNA on ice, or stored digitally, to use to avoid copy fatigue, or even fix the problem after you have somehow ignored these options, you have to pretty stupid not to see them coming right from the outset. 

My general notion is that any alien species that could be so stupid as to kill themselves off by any method that flat out guarantees extinction and should be noticed as a problem by even a random ten year old, probably should be assumed not to exist. 

It is sort of like with War of the Worlds – Pick your version, aliens again killed by viruses, only this time the old-fashioned biological kind. 

The only reason to land on a planet to attack it is if you want to keep the biology of the planet intact, rather than just nuking it from orbit till it glows in the dark. 

So you would think some consideration would be given to what that local biology might do to you. 

Ignoring that for the moment, I do wonder how they crossed the vastness of space without having airtight spaceships and spacesuits that would presumably protect them from infection. 

Such being the case I can only assume the Martian invaders occasionally took smoke breaks in the middle of the invasion and didn’t want to smell up the air inside their war machines so they went outside to light up. 

Okay, we will wrap up there. 

While obviously a lot of our examples today were decidedly over the top, in order to contemplate what we can know about alien civilizations, which includes what we can say they would not do, we need to rule out the incredibly stupid. 

By and large anyway, obviously civilizations do often act in stupid fashions, just look at us. 

The key point is that we always want to look at any cliché or stereotype about alien civilizations – and we will have more next week – and ask ourselves if it actually makes any sense, and if not, why we would expect them to do it. 

Particularly if that expectation goes to include all civilizations not just one or two that are being bloody-minded about it. 

Because for anything to be a common trait, let alone universal one, among alien civilizations it has to make a lot of sense. 

Something we have discussed a lot in terms of Exclusivity and non-Exclusivity for the Fermi Paradox. 

Next week we will continue this forward by looking at possible first contact scenarios with alien civilizations, both the first one we meet and from the perspective of it being their first meeting but not ours.

Unpredictability: Black Swans and OCPs
---
  
2016-12-29  
https://youtu.be/AHvLuhjfAyA  

---

So today we will be ending the year by discussing the predictability of the future. 

This seemed an appropriate topic for a channel focused on science and futurism, since it is so popular for folks to make predictions about the future right before the end of the year. 

We do that year round on the channel so I thought it more appropriate to discuss the uncertainty of predictions. 

We have two key concepts I wanted to bring up in relation to this, though they are not our main focus themselves. 

The first is Black Swan Theory and Events, and the second is Outside Context Problems, a pretty extreme form of black swan event. 

They are very similar in most regards and both discuss not so much the unpredictability of the future but rather the disruption caused by such events. 

I was considering also discussing Isaac Asimov’s notion of Psychohistory, of predicting the broad trends of future events, but I think we will save that for another time. 

Instead after introduce the concept I am going to discuss a few Black Swans we might see in terms of technology and some of the disruptions they might cause. 

We will start with explaining Black Swans. 

Black Swan Events is a concept that was coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, The Black Swan, and I’ll explain that in a moment. 

The name Black Swan has a simple derivation. 

Historically all swans we saw were white, so we assumed there were no black swans. 

The term Black Swan came to be one used to describe something non-existent. 

As you probably know they do exist in Australia and after being discovered the term mutated to mean something you did not think existed but in hindsight is not exactly surprising. 

There are tons of black birds and no obvious tough hurdle to getting that mutation to your feather color nor to survival. 

It’s not a neon green glow in the dark feather color, something that would seem an improbable mutation, and which would seem a hindrance to survival for any critter which wants to stay concealed. 

In hindsight the existence of a black swan seems incredibly obvious. 

It would not be surprising if they did not exist, but there is nothing surprising about their existence. 

This is the key concept of a Black Swan Event, it has to match three criteria. 

First, it has to be unexpected. 

Not necessarily totally so but it has to be hard to predict. 

Second, it has to have a major impact when it occurs, something that majorly changes civilization. 

Third, it has to be clear in hindsight. 

I’ve heard this concept get used in a lot of cases where it should not apply, especially in the world of finance it has become a bit of buzzword. 

I saw an article that was bringing up possible black swans for the economy and included the retirement of the President of European Central Bank. 

Since the current incumbent is almost 70 years old, I have difficulty imagining what is particularly unpredictable about that gentleman retiring. 

Needless to say an actual Black Swan ought to be something that genuinely matches those criteria. 

Tons tend to be offered up which do not, or at best maybe scrape in as pretty surprising, having a fairly large impact, or being more obvious in hindsight. 

I tend to distrust a lot of the examples given from old history, politics, or warfare because folks tend to have blinders about recording such events accurately or viewing them without bias. 

And in any event we are most interested in those relating to science and technology today anyway, so here are some examples of those relating to science and engineering. 

The Chernobyl, Three-Mile-Island, and Fukushima Nuclear accidents The Sinking of the Titanic The Hinderburg Disaster I cite these ones as examples of both the heavy impact of accidents, which tend be very unpredictable in advance but are often seen as very obvious in hindsight, albeit sometimes just because folks need a scapegoat, and also because of how they initiated a great deal of public distrust in the relevant technology or industry. 

These accidents arguably had a disproportionate response from the public in terms of their confidence in that technology. 

These do not have to bad though, many of them are good things and indeed almost every memorable technological advancement is a black swan. 

The Invention of the Transistor, the personal computer, the internet, and cell phones are each often deemed black swans with obvious results, though I question how unpredictable any of those but the transistor was. 

The printing press, which allowed mass production of cheap books, probably did more to fuel the rise of modern science and technology than any other invention or scientific theory, by making knowledge so easy to access. 

Those effects were quite unpredictable though both the result, and the device itself, are incredibly obvious and simple. 

In many respects it is not the invention itself, or the accident, which interests us but rather the unexpected effects. 

We will give more of those in a bit, but another old example would be the horse-collar, a device invented quite a long time before it arrived in Europe but that on doing so created a massive food surplus which both allowed more people and allowed more of them to pick specialist professions rather than farming. 

It would be very reductionist to say that the rise of Europe to near global dominance in centuries that followed was principally the result of the printing press or horse collar but a strong argument could be made that it would not have occurred without both of those and hard to argue that they were not major contributors to that. 

Interestingly it is just that rise which leads into our main example of next concept, via the Conquistadors, the arguably more extreme form of Black Swan Event called an Outside Context Problem. 

An Outside Context Problem, an OCP, is a good deal different than a Black Swan but more in terms of degree. 

We get this term from Iain M. Banks’ 1996 scifi novel Excession, published a decade before Black Swan, where it is commented on as follows: "An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilizations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop.” “The usual example given to illustrate an Outside Context Problem was imagining you were a tribe on a largish, fertile island; you’d tamed the land, invented the wheel or writing or whatever, the neighbors were cooperative or enslaved but at any rate peaceful and you were busy raising temples to yourself with all the excess productive capacity you had, you were in a position of near-absolute power and control which your hallowed ancestors could hardly have dreamed of and the whole situation was just running along nicely like a canoe on wet grass… when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears sailless and trailing steam in the bay and these guys carrying long funny-looking sticks come ashore and announce you’ve just been discovered, you’re all subjects of the Emperor now, he’s keen on presents called taxes and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests.” Now such a thing occurring to us would not be an Outside Context Problem, we would certainly be surprised if an alien ship arrived in orbit tomorrow but we certainly have a context for it. 

We have for generations now, it has been the subject of countless films, shows, and novels and we will also have it as a subject next month. 

In this respect the OCP is essentially a very extreme black swan, and I should note that neither has to be a bad thing, they can be excellent things overall, like the internet. 

They can also be entirely natural. 

I would not call an asteroid impact on Earth today an OCP, but it would probably be a Black Swan. 

Asteroid impacts are hardly unpredictable, in fact we are very good at estimating their frequency these days. 

By looking at our own history and craters on the moon we learned a lot. 

Loosely speaking the diameter of crater on the moon is inverse cube to the frequency of craters of that size. 

There are 8 times as many 5 meter wide craters as 10 meter wide craters and 8 times as many of those as 20 meter wide ones. 

For every hundred meter crater there are thousand ten meter wide craters as those are one tenth the diameter and ten cubed is a thousand. 

So from this we know that kilometer wide asteroids hit the Earth about twice in a million year period. 

They don’t hit every 500,000 years though, you could go several millions year without one then have a few hit in a period of a just a few thousand years. 

One is as likely to hit next week as in any other week, and the odds are about 1 in 25 million that it should do so. 

Needless to say next week’s episode will be probably be delayed should that occur. 

Also, needless to say, such an event would have a big impact on our civilization, in a very literal sense. 

It’s hard to think of true OCP because they have to be the sort of thing you never would expect, so the rise of a Computer Super-Intelligence would not qualify. 

The example of the Mule from Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series, the telepathic mutant who disrupted the predictive powers of psychohistory in that story, would be an OCP I think. 

Amusingly I do not think either aliens or computer super-intelligence would qualify because scientists and risk managers consider those quite possible, whereas telepathic powers are considered possible by much of the population but are not the sort of thing you’d expect to see governments having contingency plans for. 

Ghost, angels, or demons would similarly qualify, I don’t know if most people believe in all three but many do believe in one or more. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if governments had contingency plans on the shelves to deal with the arrival of an alien spaceship but I would be surprised if they had one for a portal to the pits of Hell to open up and demons to come spewing forth or the four horsemen to come riding into town. 

Now there is an obvious reason why we do not have contingency plans for such things and would be shocked by them, a lot of us would consider it impossible and those who didn’t have a simple plan in mind, take a knee and start praying. 

But that is kind of the point of an OCP, it is something you just cannot anticipate and have no context for handling, like the Sun not rising tomorrow, or gravity shutting off, or the Voyager Probe sending back an image of a crystal sphere before smashing against it. 

It would be pretty mind-bending after centuries of adapting ourselves to the notion that we are in a tiny corner of the Universe to find out we lived inside a giant television faking the stars and that whoever made it had never even expected us to interpret modern astronomy out of it but comes down for an interview to tell us how impressive and fascinating they thought our crazy complex and elaborate theories of cosmology were from what was actually random moving dots. 

Or if we managed to zoom down one more level beneath quarks and saw something that looked suspiciously like galactic superclusters and voids. 

Stuff like that would probably give me an aneurysm and I’d be in existential shock for weeks as would most scientists I’d think. 

It wouldn’t even necessarily have to be something we think is impossible or had an intelligent agency connected to it. 

Getting invaded by an Alternate Reality Earth or have an incident where an ejected black hole wandered into our solar system to enter a death spiral with the sun would qualify. 

There’s another OCP I imagine, portals opening up and armies from a parallel Earth pouring through to conquer us. 

Again a lot of these sound absurd but for it to be a genuine OCP it almost has to. 

Godzilla is not going to come storming out of the ocean to terrorize Japan and the graveyards are not going to erupt with undead and spew forth the Zombie Apocalypse but an OCP that can happen is the sort of thing you would react to in a similar way if someone suggested it. 

I simply have no context for the idea that all of a sudden a nearby mountain is going to open up a giant eyelid, look down at where we’ve drilled a tunnel through it for a freeway, and standup to demand who the heck we are, how so many of us got here while it was taking its brief million year nap, and where we get off cutting holes in him. 

So that is an OCP, again it is pretty extreme form of black swan, and also predates the concept by a decade. 

Though of course we have long had a concept for both. 

Unpredictable events, or at least unpredicted events, which play a pivotal role in history, not a terribly new concept in and of itself. 

Now let’s go ahead and play the prediction game ourselves and try to look at some technologies, ones we’ve discussed before, and consider some of the less obvious ways it might impact civilization. 

Just to illustrate how stuff can sneak up on you. 

For instance we talk a lot on the channel about fusion, the impact of fusion on our society was the subject of one of the earliest episodes, and a point I focused on there was that it wasn’t just cheap electricity. 

In fact your electric bill would not drop too much since much of it is not the price of fossil fuels or uranium but rather the maintenance of the plant and electrical lines. 

The cost of fuel is a big factor in electrical costs but dropping that to zero will not make your electrical bill drop to a tiny fraction of what it was before because you are not paying for electricity, you are paying for electricity to be reliably transported to your home. 

So even if we’re churning out gigawatts of power for peanuts, we still have to pay the same to maintain the grid, which is no trivial expense. 

It shifts the game though so that you are essentially paying for access to power, not quantity of it, much like your classic telephone connection where you paid the same whether you used it almost all day or maybe just for a few minutes one or twice a week. 

Rather we saw the impact in a lot of secondary areas where the actual cost of electricity was a major limiting factor. 

Suddenly the desalinization of water becomes cheap enough to use for bulk agriculture, the price of aluminum, which is most electricity, tumbles down to be competitive with steel, and indeed the price of fossil fuels plummets because you no longer have to worry about its scarcity or environmental impact as you have the energy to pay to suck carbon and water out of the air and recombine it into hydrocarbons. 

A process that we can do now quite easily but which takes more energy to do than would be released when you burn them. 

A pointless and self-defeating strategy when those fuels are your primary power source but not when you wish to use them essentially as batteries, running things which cannot easily be plugged into the grid. 

These are examples of secondary effects of technologies that tend to get overlooked in discussing them and part of how they become black swans. 

Many nations or places which are big oil producers tend to be either deserts or tundras, their economies on first glance would be obliterated by the end of fossil fuels but that same end opens the door to another form of wealth because now you can get away with heated greenhouses in the tundra and mass irrigation via seawater that has had the salt removed from it, those are secondary economic effects of commercial fusion. 

You could either have a total meltdown of the economy and society in big oil producers like that, or a sudden boom as Saudi Arabia becomes a major exporter of grains. 

A Tertiary effect would be that it would be a booming business turning out the aluminum and glass frames to make those tundra greenhouses, or the geo engineering industry where you will have to come up with strategies to minimize runoff from dumping trillions of liters of water onto deserts. 

Obviously being able to see the possible options is best, but sometimes you cannot, which raises the idea of being robust against the unpredictable. 

Typically by diversification of assets and industries when we’re talking economic unpredictability. 

But the same applies to warfare for instance, and to evolution itself. 

This is one of the reasons why diversity is highly valuable, even if a given option seems flat out better than the other alternatives. 

The purpose of competition is often not to produce a single winner, but to produce several, each sharpened to their specific specialty. 

We do not want every athlete to compete to be a marathon champion, we need them to be spread out to many games and as a society we are most robust when we are built for decathlons. 

This is how you prepare for when predictions do fall short, which they often do because of those secondary and tertiary effects, many of which are quite predictable even in foresight, and many of which are not, that tend to both take us off guard and result in the next over-night billionaire or boomtown. 

Many people did predict computers and cellphones and the internet and online purchases decently before they became regular household features. 

I don’t remember anyone predicting things like Google for search engines, Microsoft for Operating Systems, or Facebook for Social media, not as these giant companies whose owners often have more wealth than some small nations. 

Just for fun let’s consider a few others we can partially predict for the next few generations. 

We contemplate space elevators as a very easy way to get into space, we forget that a minor modification and addition to them allows hyper-fast transit around the planet’s surface too. 

We consider face recognition software as a handy way to tag people in photos on facebook, and we can see its value in law enforcement, and we worry about how it damages privacy, yet that same technology could allow the automatic removal of anyone from an image, either by not allowing that image or video to be uploaded without their permission or blurring them out of it. 

We consider how nice it would be to have cameras on us recording things so we can relive them years later, but ignore that same recognition software could be used to rapidly scans your recording for where you last left your car keys or the meal you had at a restaurant that you really enjoyed the last time you were there so you can recall what it is to order it, or so that the software can analyze the image and tell you what the calorie content is, or analyze your entire last year of eating and tell you how many calories you had. 

Or index and itemize every receipt you were handed. 

Forget that you can order groceries to be delivered fifteen minutes later by drone if you are missing the key piece of a recipe, what about the app that analyzes every food item you have in your house right now by scanning the video of your memory or internal house cameras and tell you what meals you have enjoyed before that you can make out of the available contents. 

Or can do one better and cross-match that against what you have eaten recently to highlight the ones with rights calories and nutrients for your next meal. 

How about an app that let’s everyone in the room permit it access to their recording of pizza and quickly scans through for shared mutual toppings everyone enjoys. 

Clothing displays that can render a quick photorealistic image of you wearing that item of clothing, ads which do the same but show you using that product, the billboard along the road that can recognize the ten people about to pass it and analyze for the optimum product to display based on those ten people. 

The TV in the elevator that is smart enough to start playing ads for deodorant and breath mints when it gets overloaded and stuck. 

These are the kind of things I personally would predict we would see rolling out in the next decade or two. 

Not just labor saving devices like a robot that can mow your lawn for you but tedium-saving devices that can do your paperwork for you and anticipatory devices that monitor you, notice you’re a little sleepy and ask if you want a cup of coffee. 

The phone that knows you are asleep or in a meeting and will only ring for emergencies as you’ve previously defined them. 

Not the sign at the library telling you to mute your phone but the signal in the library that tells those phones only to ring for emergencies, and which you can tell to ignore such suggestions. 

Are things like that Black Swans? 

Some probably are, because while we call cell phones black swans, when in fact they were entirely predicted, what we didn’t predict is the change to culture norms and behaviors that accompanied them. 

Our interest today is not in making predictions, there are plenty of those out there and I’ve never considered myself much more accurate at making them than you would get just using tea leaves or a Ouija Board. 

Partially we are trying to emphasize just how hard it is to foresee a lot of this stuff and why we shouldn’t trust a lot of the predictions we often see in futurism because often our sense of logic blinds us. 

It is very easy to just say ‘of course X will happen’ and get a bit myopic about the future. 

This channel is not and never really has been about making predictions about the future, we tend to focus more on examining common staples of futurism and science fiction and asking if they actually make much sense on inspection, or if the concept might be resting on an assumption that is fundamentally flawed and kills the entire concept. 

To make your civilization robust against the sort of disruptions even positive black swans can bring, you have be constantly questioning your basic assumptions about future predictions. 

We see this a lot when discussing space colonization, how the assumption of having faster than light travel one day or settling people onto other planets tends to blind us to the much more probable path into the future that we will tend to build our habitats, not tweak existing ones. 

We don’t go hunting for new caves to live in and then spruce them up to be nicer, we build caves where we want them instead. 

We also see it a lot with the Fermi Paradox when people try to explain away the Great Silence in terms of their preconceptions of how aliens ought to behave, and that’s something we will be looking at more next year, alien civilizations. 

Not so much how they will behave, because we cannot predict that much, but rather what we can say about how they would not behave. 

That will feed into our first two topics for next year, the major black swan and possible full blown OCP of a first contact situation with an alien civilization. 

We will get to that in two weeks, but first, for next week, we are going to go through and look at a lot of common themes we see in discussion of alien civilizations and ask ourselves if those actually make much sense or could be viewed as misconceptions or even just flat out silly. 

Like the notion that aliens would want to enslave humans or eat us. 

Or many others that just don’t make sense at all and imply the aliens are just flat out stupid. 

We will try to clear away some of the science fiction clutter about that so that we can go on the next week to ask ourselves about a First Contact Situation, and then throughout the next year we will visit the topic of possible alien civilizations some more. 

That will close us out for this year though, Year 2, which has been an interesting one. 

The channel went from being a small one with about a thousand subscribers and about a dozen episodes made every other month or so to one with about 30,000 subscribers and weekly episodes. 

The first video of 2016, Moon Base Concepts, didn’t even come out till February but the next video at the end of the month began our weekly cycle, and I never thought I’d be able to keep up that rate of production but now it feels pretty natural and the quality had continued to rise. 

A lot of that is thanks to the channels supporters on Patreon, whose generous donations have helped to keep the channel going and improving. 

I can’t properly express my gratitude to those folks enough and if you’d like to join them, there’s a link to the channel’s Patreon account in the episode description, and you can also donate via the Channel’s website. 

Speaking of that website, I want to thank Luis, or webmaster, for all the time he’s volunteered creating and maintaining that. 

Also Jakub Grygier, who creates all the excellent cover art and thumbnails for the channel, and the mods and admins over at the Channel’s Facebook and Reddit groups, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, and also the members there who have been helping me come up with topics and often helping me edit the scripts themselves. 

At the beginning of the year this was entirely a one-man show, and it definitely shows in the quality, and hopefully that quality will keep rising in year 3. 

So next week will be Stupid Aliens, followed by First Contact, don’t forget to subscribe to the channel for alerts when those and other episodes come out, and if you enjoyed the episode, please like it and share it with others. 

Until next time, Thanks for watching, have a great day, and have a great year!

Fermi Paradox: Stay At Home Civilizations
---
  
2016-12-22  
https://youtu.be/aDqjK5vR6hE  

---

Today we come back to the Fermi Paradox to contemplate the concept of advanced civilizations that don’t go out and colonize the galaxy or go extinct, but manage to exist for truly long periods of time just on their home planet, or perhaps their own solar system. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the Fermi Paradox itself is not our main focus, but more of a backdrop to this concept because it is a recurring one in discussion of alien civilizations. 

That said, if this is your first visit to this channel, or you just haven’t seen those episodes, I do recommend watching the earlier Fermi Paradox episodes before this one especially the Fermi Paradox Compendium. 

This is not a good introductory episode. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a refresher though, the Fermi Paradox is the apparent contradiction between how immense and old the universe is and how apparently absent of intelligent life it is. 

There are tons of solution for why this is the case and we covered all of those in the aforementioned Compendium. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now one of the common camps is that technological civilizations like our own do not arise very often, either because life doesn’t emerge too often or the evolutionary path to intelligent tool users just doesn’t get followed much. 

We don’t see alien civilizations because none have developed yet near enough of for us to see them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other side of that argument is that technological civilizations do emerge fairly often but something prevents us from seeing them. 

That can be extinction, which we covered in the Apocalypse How video, or it could be because such civilizations do not expand much, are not that common, and tend to stay fairly quiet. 

We discussed a lot of other options and they just don’t work very well. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against that we have the idea of a civilization that has the brains but not the ability. 

Dolphins never develop technology because they can’t light fires under water. 

The hyper-intelligent snail people of Mollusk V might lack the hands or tentacles to use tools, but even if they had them the gravity on their world is just too high and the atmosphere too thick for them to get into orbit using conventional rockets, so they never turn their eyes to the skies. 

They might exist for eons that way, and even if their technology eventually improves enough to allow them to economically get off their planet they may have adopted an attitude of it being a bad idea to try. 

People do that, faced with a nigh impossible task they will often come up with laundry list of other downsides that become conventional wisdom and remain so even after the landscape had changed to permit the idea. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The notion of a long-lasting but non-expanding civilization is one we also ruled out as decent explanation for the Fermi Paradox, but it was a bit different than some others. 

We didn’t say that there are not civilizations that stay at home, or that they were uncommon, but rather we ruled it out because it does appear possible to expand outward and colonize an entire galaxy and it would only take a tiny fraction of civilizations to do just that to destroy it as a Fermi Paradox Solution. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But again we didn’t say such civilizations were uncommon let alone impossible. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a lot of reasons to get out and colonize the galaxy, and as we will see some make more sense than others. 

If you are a regular on this channel you know I am a strong advocate of doing just that, and basically to me looking at the night sky is like looking at a bunch of beautiful bonfires… made of burning libraries. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every star in this Galaxy which does not currently have an inhabited planet around it is just wasting its energy, energy that could be used to support life and which I believe can, should, and will be turned to that end by us in the next few million years. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is not common way of looking at space exploration, I suspect a lot of the regular audience here who have absorbed some of the ideas we kick around might share that view now but it isn’t a common one. 

I don’t think it is a controversial one, just the byproduct of thinking some of these ideas through to their logical conclusion. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s consider some of the more normal reasons for space exploration and consider how logical those are, and ask if you need to colonize a bunch of other solar systems to do them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have valid points, but many also do not, and of those that do, we are going to consider if there are alternatives. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will just list out the reasons to do it and the reasons not too, then we will come back and chew through them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the most commons reasons I could find to go out into space: 1. 

So we don’t have all our eggs in one basket here on Earth. 

2. 

Because we need the raw materials 3. 

Because we need the space 4. 

To better Understand our own world 5. 

To Inspire mankind and future generations 6. 

To seek out new life and new civilizations Mostly good reasons, or at least they sound good. 

Here is the list of reasons not to do it: 1. 

We still haven’t finished exploring Earth yet 2. 

We need to solve our problems here first 3. 

It is a waste of money 4. 

We could be blundering into threats we can’t handle yet Okay, let us go through and contemplate those, and since we are asking why people might stay at home on Earth I will mostly play Devil’s Advocate. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s look at our first one. 

Get off Earth, if something happens to it humanity goes with it. 

Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket. 

This would a great reason except for two key problems. 

First off, civilizations aren’t eggs, except in the sense that if you place a colony somewhere it is going to hatch into a thriving civilization all on its own. 

This is not a great way to preserve your civilization. 

When you throw technology into the mix, things like genetic engineering, and look at these things on astronomical timelines, there won’t be much in common with the colony and the world that sent it. 

Second, you don’t need other solar systems to protect your civilization from natural hazards and it won’t protect you from intelligent threats. 

A few dozens of the kinds of rotating habitats we have discussed on this channel so many times give you all the backup you need and there are room for trillions of them in the solar system, millions just in close proximity to Earth, but you could stick some far off in the Oort Cloud if you just want distance as protection, and those can be constructed to be Supernova proof. 

They can also be constructed to be decent interstellar starships, so having a few dozen scattered around your solar system gives you an excellent backup against natural disasters and accidents. 

To truly threaten a technological civilization, one that is advanced enough to be able to go to another solar system and terraform a planet in the first place, you need intelligence. 

And distance won’t help you against that because there is no stealth in space and you can’t hide. 

If I’m the commander of some Alien Extermination Fleet, I am going to know where your backup colonies are because I saw your ships go there, and I am not going to call it a day when I’ve obliterated your homeworld. 

I will go track down all your colonies because I know where they are and I do not want them growing up to come get some vengeance in a few thousand years. 

You do need space technology to get yourself protection from certain types of threats but you don’t need much and you don’t need an interstellar civilization to have it. 

Some threats like asteroids just are not a threat to a technologically advanced species, you don’t need a backup planet to protect you from that and a random asteroid approaching your planet is more likely to be regarded as a lucky mining resource, not a threat. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of course is another reason often cited to get to space. 

We need the resources, we want the metal. 

We talked about this in the asteroid Mining episode, except for precious metals like gold and platinum, which you don’t really need just want, we have more of everything down here on Earth than in our entire Asteroid Belt. 

Asteroid mining is great for getting metals to be used in space, not for bringing it home to Earth itself. 

If you aren't planning to build up a huge space infrastructure then all those moons and asteroids are mostly worthless. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of folks say we need the space for our population to grow. 

Or expand into, but population growth cannot be fixed by interstellar colonization. 

It costs more energy to get a person to another solar system then it would to keep them alive for centuries anyway. 

Also as we’ve discussed in other episodes you can stuff a lot more people into a solar system than you can into an entire galaxy if you are just using planets. 

One way or another, if you are living here on Earth, we are going to run out of room if we keep growing in numbers. 

After you fill up your solar system, after you fill up your galaxy, after you use all the tricks for miniaturizing stuff, or even people, you will still eventually have to either stop growing your numbers back here on Earth or you’ve got a problem. 

We quadrupled the human population last century, if we kept up that sort of growth in a bit over 10,000 years we’d have more people than there are atoms in the Universe. 

We’ve talked about some ways to support truly huge numbers of people, both regular old people like ourselves and purely digital folks living in digital existences, but I don’t care how good you are miniaturization you aren't going to support a person on less than one atom even if they live on a computer chip. 

At those kinds of growth rates you’d fill up the kind of Planet-wide supercities we discussed in Ecumenopolises in five-hundred years, a classic Dyson Swarm in a bit over a thousand years, and even a Matrioshka Brain in about four thousand years. 

If you are colonizing the galaxy you still haven't gotten out to all but a tiny piece of it by then even if you could go the speed of light, and 10% is probably about as fast as you can get with a colony ship. 

So you have to stop growth eventually, and even if you are growing more modestly that just slows down the timeline. 

We must also consider life extension. 

Extending human lifetimes beyond a century will also increase your growth rate and alter many other dynamics. 

Some folks would say you might as well start now and just keep to the current population or even bring it down lower. 

&nbsp;I don’t agree but that doesn’t invalidate that perspective. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another popular one is that it will help us better understand our own planet, and I think that is quite true. 

But mostly because of what we can learn from satellites around the planet and some associated technologies. 

We could learn a lot about weather by having a few hundred Earth-like planets we could watch the weather on, but I suspect we will have that down pat long before we get people or even robots around planets in other solar system to watch them up close. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We would also say that learning about the Universe and exploring it can inspire mankind and generations of scientists to come. 

That is true, Gargarin and Glenn and Armstrong and the others inspired countless people all around the planet. 

There are other sources of inspiration though, other fields which have greatly contributed to mankind and inspired us too, and you do get diminishing returns on that investment. 

I couldn’t think of the name of single member of the current crew up on the Space Station and I would be surprised if most people could name anyone who had been up there in the last decade. 

Which is a pity, because there are ton of amazing folks from a bunch of different countries who have been up there doing their nations and the humanity proud. 

But it is what it is. 

We remember Amundsen and Scott as the first to lead teams to the South Pole, but who knows the names of any of the hundred or so people down at the Amundsen-Scott Station on the South Pole. 

We remember Magellan’s Expedition for circumnavigating the globe, but that’s mundane now and the crew on the ISS actually do it fifteen times a day. 

So it isn't a great investment for inspiration. 

We will remember the first person step foot on Mars or on some planet around Alpha Centauri, but not the hundredth person to do so or the hundredth new planet someone sets foot on. 

Also, there are plenty of things to be inspired by back here on Earth too. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is inspirational, the idea to set foot on where no one has gone before, to seeks out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is a great reason to go into space, unfortunately it probably isn’t. 

Science-fiction, especially Star Trek, tends to imply you can meander around the galaxy and just blunder across new civilizations and spatial anomalies every week. 

This is highly unlikely in a non-FTL universe. 

You would know long before you got to a solar system if anything is living there, even non-intelligent life ought to be pretty obvious. 

You wouldn’t send people to these anyway, you’d send robots. 

Sending people there, loaded up as we are with tons of strains of viruses and bacteria, is not a great approach to exploring an alien ecosystem. 

Robots are better, especially if your robots are smart enough to do all the cataloguing on their own so you don’t need people up in orbit of that planet controlling them remotely. 

As to technological civilizations, you should be able to see them a long way off, even if they are hiding. 

You’d need centuries or even longer to get to visit them face to face and that’s not the sort of thing you do by surprise. 

If you did just happen to wander into a solar system that contains a civilization that’s been hiding there, I suspect they won’t appreciate guests very much anyway. 

Yes it would be great to meet aliens and to talk with them and to explore the universe together, but I think that’s better done by making first contact at a distance and only with those who want it. 

That’s a topic we will be looking at in January, first contact with alien civilizations. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, those are some of the more popular ideas for why we should go into space. 

And they are good ones, but as we see, a lot of them are a bit thin. 

Or at least seem that way when contemplated as a reason to move your civilization out beyond your own planet and solar system. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let us go the other way and look at some of the reasons suggested for why we shouldn’t go out into space. 

I generally don’t think much of these, and again I’d imagine the majority of the audience of this channel don’t either, but some are a bit more solid than they first appear to be when we examine them. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First we have the notion that we still haven’t finished exploring our own planet .This is true, we have barely cracked the surface of neat and interesting things to study just here on Earth. 

It is the most interesting place in the Universe, at least that we know of. 

But this is not a good one for a few reasons. 

First, by exploring off the planet we do often learn a lot about the planet, or get the tools for doing so, that was one of our common reasons given to explore space after all. 

Second, we will eventually figure out our own planet, and I doubt it will take millions of years to do it. 

So it only delays things in that respect. 

Third, we can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. 

I don’t see why we can’t explore Earth and Space at the same time anymore than we can research chemistry and biology at the same time. 

Heck we do better by exploring both at once. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many would also say we need to solve our problems here first. 

I hear this a lot when we talk about colonizing Mars. 

We don’t want to export our screwed up civilization to another planet This tends to be followed by some soap-boxing about whatever they dislike most about our civilization. 

I am never too clear why so many folks are so down on humanity. 

Personally, I think we’re pretty awesome, I mean not as awesome as a dinosaur, but pretty awesome. 

Still I’d have to agree we certainly have our failings, I just don’t think that will ever not be true, at least in our own eyes. 

If we are examining ourselves and not finding faults, we probably shouldn’t be leaving Earth because we have probably devolved into a super-narcissistic society. 

So if we use this as a reason not to go, it is unlikely to ever change. 

I don’t find it compelling though. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next we have the idea that it is a waste of money. 

This is obviously subjective, NASA is very expensive, its annual budget is larger than entire Gross Domestic Product of fully half the nations on this planet. 

That said, it represents a relatively minor budgetary expense against the United States own GDP, being about a thousandth. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument is still valid, especially when stretched to include non-scientific missions. 

We learn a lot of new science and develop a lot of new technology through space but we also do by investing that same money in something like cancer research. 

You could argue more good would be done by investing NASA’s budget into curing leukemia but that’s a superficial approach to how research works. 

Research gets done by finding smart people who are passionate about something and giving them the resources to look into it. 

Doubling or halving the money we spend on something isn’t going to double or half the time it takes to make a breakthrough and sciences are pretty interconnected. 

Breakthroughs in one often help in another. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that only applies to the research itself, it is hard to argue spending a few billion bucks to land people on the moon again is a responsible use of funds right now, for instance. 

Next we have the idea that by going out into space we could find ourselves running in threats we don’t know about and can’t handle yet. 

At first glance, this one does seem like a good concern, maybe the best, but the thing is there isn’t any reason to think there’s anything out there that is a threat we can’t handle. 

Now I know, two obvious rebuttals spring to mind. 

First, you are thinking, “Isaac, you just said threats we don’t know about. 

If we don’t know about them, how can you say we can handle them?” Which is a fair point, and you are also probably thinking, “Hey Isaac, what about aliens? 

Are you saying a high-tech alien civilization is a threat we can handle?” And the answer is no, if they wanted to attack us they’d mash us up badly. 

We talked about how insanely huge the scale of a Kardashev 2 civilization was a couple months back and how they could crush us like a bug even if they only had modern technology. 

But I also said they could see us anywhere in the galaxy and come get us no matter what we do. 

They’re not a threat we can handle, they just are a threat that isn’t altered by us going out into space or not. 

Similarly, if there are hazards in space we don’t know about, there is only one way to find out what those are and if they cost us some explorers, well that is why we tend idolize explorers. 

They take risks, they roll the dice, and sometimes those come up snake-eyes. 

We are not a species of cowards and I hope we don’t devolve into one, certainly not one that is terrified into staying home because we’re afraid of the unknown. 

I have to say, I didn’t find those reasons to compelling, so I asked the audience for some ideas why we might stay at home and I got some good ones. 

As you may or may not know this topic was selected by a poll over on the Channel’s Facebook Group. 

It came in first out of about forty options. 

The topic surprised me, “What if we won’t go anywhere? 

What if we stay on Earth?”. 

I thought, what a strange topic to ask me of all people to cover, especially as most of the videos in the last couple months have been about colonizing space. 

So I threw together a quick video for the facebook group asking them to give me their best ideas for why we might never leave Earth, or the solar system at least. 

As I said I got some good ones, at least better than the common ones we just covered. 

Let’s look at those. 

One of the most common and compelling arguments that was brought up in one variant or another was that we might back off from space because of time lag of communication. 

This doesn't hold up in a classically human civilization but it does work a lot better in the context of a lot of the Transhuman or Technological Singularity style civilizations. 

While those tend to be immortal by definition, so that time shouldn’t be a huge issue, it is worth remembering that some of those could find time delays of even a second incredibly maddening. 

If your mind has been sped up to process information millions of times faster, in many respects time is basically running millions of time slower for you. 

Just the four or five seconds needed for a message to get to the moon and for them to reply would seem like an entire year to you. 

Waiting for the next book by your favorite author might seem like a few million years, which is even longer than it takes George R.R. Martin to put out a new book. 

To such a person the idea of leaving behind the solar system might sound like the worst kind of hell. 

And one of the audience even flipped around the notion of hive minds on me. 

Normally I don’t think much about hive minds in regard to space travel, I figure if one altered the dynamics on research and development it would be to accelerate it. 

But you can't run some networked mind at that kind of scale without risking a loss of cohesion. 

And you wouldn’t think of a hive mind as wanting to spawn more separate hive minds, it kinda runs contrary to the basic premise. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which raises a good point about normal civilizations too. 

Colonies tend not to be terribly friendly to their homeland for too long. 

As time goes by and they diverge culturally, they can become an enemy. 

Now they might not, and it might be a thing only a minority did, but there is still a finite chance that one day an invasion fleet is going to arrive from one of your colonies. 

It’s not even a particularly small chance when you get around to it, but big or small it is non-zero. 

Right now the chance of an invasion from Mars is zero. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some might say why take the risk? 

And every new colony heightens that risk. 

They are eggs in another basket and they could hatch nightmares. 

Some colony might get relaxed about its safeguard to prevent spawning some malevolent super-intelligent computer and next thing you know a swarm of robots ships comes flying back to Earth. 

Why spend huge amounts of money colonizing other solar systems when we honestly won’t get much out of it but will get a lot of potential threats. 

And back here on Earth we probably won’t see many benefits from it either, not for a very long time at least. 

For instance we might have finished science, figured it all out, before the first colony contributes its first groundbreaking piece of original new science. 

You can only conduct serious interstellar trade in information, new science, new art, and so on. 

Some might argue patience is a virtue considering the risk and we should just continue here in our solar system, after all it wouldn’t have to just be Earth, and we have seen the sorts of massive civilizations you can build around just one star. 

Those ought to spew out more original art and entertainment every second than a single person could watch in a thousand lifetimes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We might find something more interesting at home too. 

As I mentioned back in the Compendium and the Dyson Dilemma, all our assumptions break apart if we start tossing in options like perpetual motion machines being invented or someone finding out a way to open portal to alternate universes where Earth is the same just never got populated by people. 

We could also see inside a purely digital civilization that they might not want to go traveling. 

In such a thing, where one can exist constantly inside virtual reality environments and be immortal in that existence, they might find artificial landscapes made by each other to be vastly more interesting than Universe. 

At such a point the idea of traveling to another solar system might seem as interesting as leaving an amusement park to travel at great expense for many centuries to visit one random small town in farm country, with no internet or phones. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could get pretty lazy in such an existence too. 

A person born into a Utopia, especially the more extreme kinds offered by virtual realities, is going to have motivation problems even learning enough to keep their civilization running, let alone exploring space, which is relatively dull and unpleasant. 

A lot of post-scarcity civilization could fall apart just from compounding laziness. 

Fortunately such places by their very nature would tend to have a lot immortal people - be they human or some AI - kicking around still to fix stuff, and for that matter make sure someone doesn’t decide to use their super-3D printer that can make anything to make nuclear bombs or something worse because they are bored and have no ethics. 

Of course such a civilization could get turn into a serious police state, even if everybody had everything they could want, just because they need to monitor everything to prevent some lone lunatic from killing everyone. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which brings up our last one, from the audience anyway, that you could end up staying at home because no one is allowed to leave because humanity is under totalitarian control. 

That could even be fairly benevolent, many a tyrannic regime actually has been compared to its neighbors and tyranny has been the norm, not the exception, of human civilization. 

It probably is pretty common among aliens too. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could have one pop up just to protect people from each other, that is the scary thing about a police state after all. 

Benevolent or terrifying, the one thing such a government would never look fondly on is the idea of some colony too far away for them to monitor and control. 

Heck they might even get that passed by popular support when you consider the dangers that might get bred up in those colonies where they can't control dangerous technologies and some fool might let a dangerously malevolent artificial intelligence off the chain to cannibalize that colony system and come home to Earth with an armada planning to do the same. 

I said in past episode that the only way to stop colonization, if the technology got practical, would be to shoot down any ship that tried to leave for no greater crime than wanting to leave. 

I never said people couldn’t do that, just that I didn’t think anyone would go that far. 

But in this context the people doing the shooting are not firing on people who are only guilty of wanting to leave, they are shooting at people they firmly believe are, whether they want to be or not, endangering all of humanity by leaving. 

To them it would be the same as being on guard outside a city under quarantine that was infected with a plague and somebody jumped the wall and tried to flee, carrying that plague with them to uninfected cities. 

They might fire warning shots or try to tackle the person but if that doesn’t work they will probably shoot them and I won’t say they’d be wrong to do it. 

The last one to discuss, and the one that always worked for me, as a reason to leave our own solar system, is the notion that no matter what else, one day the sun will burn out and when it dies so would we, along with everything we accomplished. 

In the end the sun will go dark. 

That’s billions of years off and by using some of the tricks we have discussed before like starlifting we could lengthen that even more. 

Heck if we could disassemble the sun and just use it to power Earth via fusion it would have enough fuel to light our planet not for a few billion more years but several billions of billions of years, millions of times longer than we have before the last stars in the Universe die off. 

I hate to say it but that is time enough, if we haven’t figured out how to extend our existence indefinitely by then I don’t see that cannibalizing the rest of the galaxy to extend it further would serve much purpose. 

We would have long since cracked immortality, I wouldn’t be surprised if we did by the end of this century and I would be surprised if we hadn’t by the end of the next. 

Such a civilization would have long since gone a step past zero-growth because you aren't even having children to replace people who died of old age, just those who decided to die. 

And I figure such decisions ought to get less and less frequent as time rolled on since those still alive would be the ones who especially liked living and were better at helping others decide to do so too. 

You could have some billion year old civilization here on Earth where most folks are very nearly that old and no one has died in a million years. 

That would be a weird group and I could see them getting collectively exhausted and just saying enough, we have people here who make Einstein look dumb and they’ve been researching ways to beat entropy for a billion years. 

We don’t think we will ever figure it out and honestly we don’t feel like trying anymore. 

It seems like our purpose in life is just to keep living. 

Why go to the effort of sending out ships to go gather up more hydrogen to keep us running? 

Let’s just run out the clock. 

I don’t think they would go that route but I could imagine a handful of people still kicking around as the last fuel ran out and just shutting off the lights on all the monstrous libraries and museums they collected down the eons and going to have a drink before the world ended. 

It doesn’t matter how many systems we colonize, someone will eventually have that job, and I could see a lot civilizations deciding to do their curtain call earlier than they have to so they can go out with dignity and all their monuments and mementos intact, rather than cannibalizing them all to buy a little more time. 

If tomorrow the sun went out and the Earth started getting colder, I can’t see myself burning all my books just to buy myself a couple more days or robbing my neighbor for their furniture to do the same. 

So I could see civilizations deciding to stay at home for that reason and others. 

A touch depressing, that last one, but there are some scenarios that might let us keep going forever, even past the timeline we discussed in the episode about civilization at the end of time, and I think we will talk about those sometime next year. 

Taken as a whole, I do not find any of these arguments truly compelling. 

I honestly don’t think many civilizations will choose to stay home and in the context of the Fermi Paradox I just can’t believe they all would, so it isn’t a great solution for the Fermi Paradox in my eyes, though better than many we have looked at. 

We are going to talk more about alien civilizations next year too, including discussing the scenario of First Contact with them next month. 

However next week’s episode will close out Year 2 for this channel and the topic then is going to be Black Swan Events and some related concepts like OCP or Outside Context Problems introduced in the late Iain M. Banks novel Excession. 

This is the notion of things occurring that no one predicted or could predict and just rocked the landscape. 

First Contact with aliens is often given as an example of such things. 

I thought that was an appropriate way to end the year when it tends to be popular for a lot of folks to make predictions about the future. 

I considered doing that myself, a list of what technologies I thought we would develop in the next generation maybe, but I think we will go the other way and remind ourselves how uncertain the future is instead. 

Again that is next week, and if you haven't already seen them I suggest going back and watching the earlier episodes about the Fermi Paradox or some of the topics we mentioned today like Matrioshka Brains or Starlifitng. 

As always, if you enjoyed the episode, make sure to like it and share it with others, and subscribe to the channel for alerts when new episodes come out. 

Until next time, thanks for watching, and have a great day!

Life in a Space Colony, ep3: Early Interstellar Colonies
---
  
2016-12-15  
https://youtu.be/6VBCxWcAPXw  

---

Today’s episode is the third and final of a three part series looking at what life might be like on colonies or colonial spaceships. 

Today we are focusing on interstellar colonies, or more accurately early interstellar colonies. 

As we have noted before, with the barrier of light speed communication, in many ways a colony around another star is almost an alien civilization, as we can expect them to diverge from us quite quickly, as these things go. 

This is something we discussed before in the episode on the Kardashev Scale, cultures diverge pretty quickly in isolation and when you toss in options for genetic engineering and cybernetics you could get major physical and psychological divergences quite quickly. 

So that is why our focus today is on Early Extrasolar Colonies. 

What the ones relatively near Earth would be like early on, not what some colony halfway across the galaxy might be like by the time we get their message saying they arrived safely, fifty thousand years after they sent it and maybe half a million years since they left. 

Possibly hopping from planet to planet, settling each in a long chain from Earth all the way to the edge of the galaxy. 

As you might recall from last episode, I introduced the idea of a Gardener Ship, a vessel that did just that, leaving Earth and stopping at stars to drop off most of its passenger and equipment, and remaining for a few years to help them get setup and to bring on new fuel and raw materials. 

Once they left they would repopulate their numbers on the long journey and manufacture new colonial equipment in their many decades of space flight to the next system. 

We named our example ship Unity, after the colony ship from one of my favorite games about colonizing alien planets, Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri. 

When we left off in episode 2 Unity had just arrived at our target System of Tau Ceti. 

Now Unity was a big ship, 500 meters wide and 2000 long, massing over a hundred million tons, and able to travel at 10% of light speed. 

It’s a huge ship that when it left Earth had 200,000 souls aboard, and arrived 120 years later with 300,000. 

We will also assume they have a couple dozen smaller interplanetary colonial ships like we discussed last time, the Hyperion, except in that our example Hyperion was intentional made very slow for what a fusion craft should be capable of so we could analyze a longer voyage. 

We will assume fusion reactors are still pretty big and massive things not suited for landing in atmospheres let alone leaving them, so we will say they have larger fusion powered freighters meant for space alone and more aerodynamic shuttles meant for landing on planets, using some chemical fuel like now, probably hydrogen and oxygen, so they can get back off a planet too but not with much cargo. 

Shuttles and Freighters. 

I will also assume someone has figured out a material cheap enough to mass produce and strong enough to serve as a space elevator on an Earth-mass planet, so that we can use one on Aurora. 

Not a huge stretch, as we’ve discussed before there are materials that will do that job for any object decently less massive than Earth and it possible Graphene, the miraculously strong carbon allotrope, could get the job done on Earth. 

If not we would have to fall back on some other launch assist methods we discussed before but I don’t think it is too huge of a stretch to assume these technologies for our discussion today, just so long as we keep in mind there are lower technology approaches to fall back on if we do not have these. 

Okay, let us walk through the mechanics of this colonization, with those assumptions. 

Our New Solar System We picked Tau Ceti as the system for our hypothetical example for a few reasons. 

At 12 light years from Earth it is the closest G-type star that isn’t a binary or multiple star system. 

As a G8 star it is dimmer and smaller than our own sun, a G2, making it only about half as bright as our own sun. 

It is also older than our sun by a billion years and change but that’s okay, since it is smaller, it will live a few billion years longer anyway. 

It has long been a popular place in science fiction for those reasons. 

Tons of authors have used it as setting, including my namesake Isaac Asimov, who used it as the home system for the planet Aurora, the most powerful of the fifty ‘Spacer Worlds’ in his classic Robot series. 

It has always been considered a great candidate for planets too. 

Which we know it has, now that our telescopes are good enough to see them. 

And it has lots of them. 

We’ve only found five so far, but they are all either quite big or quite close to their sun. 

It is always easier to see the ones that are bigger or closer to their sun. 

So we are on pretty safe ground to assume there’s plenty more. 

It also has a huge debris disk, estimated to contain ten times the asteroids and comets our solar system has. 

So even if it doesn’t have a good Earth Analogue we have doubtless got tons of moons and asteroids to work with. 

As we saw in episode 1 and discussed many times before, moons and asteroids are in many ways easier to colonize, especially if we have fusion as a power source, which we do today. 

So we don’t need to worry about if any of those planets are of a good size and distance for classic terraforming. 

Truth be told, odds are good that by the time we get around to doing interstellar colonization a very large part of humanity, possibly a super-majority, will have been born and raised inside cylinder habitats inside asteroids so many might not only be indifferent to whether there is an Earth-like planet in a system they could terraform but quite uncomfortable at the notion of living on one. 

Still, we wouldn’t be thorough if we bypassed this option so we will assume a fair amount of the colonists came on this trip because they wanted an Earth-like planet to settle now that Earth is fairly full. 

Probably most of the folks who went on ice for the voyage. 

Since we are not actually talking about Tau Ceti so much as any random solar system we will assume there is a decently Earth-like habitable zone planet there so we can discuss that option, and I will go ahead and call it Aurora. 

I will also assume it has got some sort of gas giant decently far from its sun, a safe enough bet. 

Unity, here to help us setup and also needing to pick up new raw materials and fuel, is not suited for landing on Aurora, at least not if we wants to take off again, we might be able to land it in one piece. 

This means our first stop is not Aurora. 

That’s a major point worth clarifying. 

We always think of the first stop in a new solar system being the planet we plan to terraform, but from a practical perspective it is the last place you want to stop. 

Gravity is not your friend, the hardest part about creating a large industrial infrastructure in our own solar system is getting the equipment and manpower off Earth to begin with. 

When arriving in a new solar system you want to get that basic space infrastructure in place before landing on that planet. 

This is even more true in our case since Unity is not going to land on Aurora. 

It is also going to leave the Tau Ceti System in a few years. 

It needs fuel and raw materials for that trip, and it also needs them to maneuver around this solar system helping with colonization. 

It needs fuel, hydrogen or deuterium, and that is going to be abundant anywhere in the outer solar system where methane and water ice will contain plenty of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. 

Even as huge as Unity is it could retank all its fuel, water, and air off even a modest comet or icy moon, probably hundreds of time over. 

Gravity isn’t your friend if you are spaceship so we would probably be looking for a decent sized icy body as close in toward the sun as we could find. 

That’s going to be our true alpha base because Unity is going to go right up to thing and just park on it for a while. 

So Unity spots a large number of moons around that gas giant, three of interest being a moon with its own thick nitrogen atmosphere like Titan has, one a smaller icy moon, and another smaller, rocky one that shows signs of being heavy in metals and carbon. 

They also notice the gas giant has one giant eye-shaped perpetual storm a bit like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, and decide for thematic purposes to name the gas giant Odin, as mythological parallel to Jupiter, and Odin had only one eye. 

Having done so they name the rocky Moon Thor, the Titan-like planet with its atmosphere Njord, for the Norse God of Wind, and our icy moon Hodor, for the Norse God of Winter, not the Game of Thrones character, though I am going to pronounce it that way anyway because I loved that character. 

Incidentally I’m naming these things and getting a bit specific because we are planning to discuss administration and governance this time and that is going to be easier if we try to use some examples. 

So Unity is going to head into Hodor and make it the first place it lands. 

Landing Now Njord is the only one of these moons that Unity couldn’t land and take off from, so they go ahead and find a nice large crater on Hodor, and land just inside the rim. 

Odin is probably hitting them with a fair amount of radiation and Tau Ceti probably has a lot more debris wandering around risking collision damage. 

Unity is quite heavily armored but the colony here won’t be initially, so they will be setting up around the rim and probably building things better resembling igloos than domes. 

Now that they have water they have energy to spare, since removing hydrogen from water, or even deuterium, costs a tiny fraction of the energy it will produce when used in a fusion reactor. 

Since they do have fusion they don’t care about the distant and dim sun as a source of power, the colony here does not need the sunlight. 

Also, Hodor isn’t a big moon, we didn’t want a big moon with lots of gravity, so the colonists will be living inside spin-gravity habitats anyway and won’t consider the surface to be ‘up’ in the normal sense. 

Those buildings on the surface will possess just enough gravity to make things fall down and will exist just to handle operations on the surface which will mostly be loading and unloading freighters. 

It is very easy to dig deep because it is all ice, plus some rocky meteors mixed in. 

They can just melt tunnels though more likely they’d cut blocks of ice out and move them. 

A meter wide cube of ice might weigh one ton on Earth, but here a person could carry one on each shoulder like they were just big cushions. 

You could also make large ice domes by just having a thin dome frame, with another a bit above it, and filling the interior with water then letting it freeze and removing your frame to use elsewhere. 

Unity had a giant power plant, as mentioned last time, so they could be melting megatons of water and have huge hoses snaking to hundreds of domes if they wanted, each meant to be meters thick of ice sturdy enough to act as bomb shelters, because gravity is so low that all those meters of ice don’t require any structural support. 

Later on they will probably want to include a ceiling with thick insulation so they can heat those domes without melting them but for now they will do. 

They are basically just making warehouses for the moment. 

So everyone is popping champagne corks of course, probably on 120 year old bottles brought from Earth. 

As mentioned last time, of the original 200,000 colonists, half stayed awake and half went on ice. 

Those that stayed awake are still alive, again as mentioned last time, the simple ability to restore life to people who have been frozen for a century also strongly implies the technology to extend human lifetimes indefinitely. 

During the voyage those original 100,000 gave birth to another 100,000 people, though many are probably their grandkids and great-grand-kids too. 

Assuming half a liter of champagne each, incidentally, means they stored and drank roughly 150 tons of champagne. 

Everyone is happy and excited and ready to get to work of course. 

Here on Hodor they are setting up a couple of fusion reactors to power the colony and melt ice and use electrolysis to separate the hydrogen and oxygen for those reactors and for Unity. 

Unity is not staying long. 

Probably just a few weeks to off load cargo, restock its tanks with fuel, water, and oxygen, and give everyone a chance to get off the ship, stretch their legs and look around. 

They will then go ahead and leave Hodor, leaving behind all their freighters. 

Those will follow along with more water and oxygen and fuel in a week or so when they are full. 

The colonists on Hodor have the easiest job of the three moons so they are also expected to do most of the food growth for Odin. 

They have tons of hydroponics equipment on Unity, which won’t need most of it anymore since most of its passengers are disembarking in the coming months. 

The big construction task is going to be setting up tons of hydroponics. 

However they do not have a lot of nitrogen locally or minerals, and the former is going to come from Njord. 

It has that big thick nitrogen atmosphere but it also has a gravity well that is a bit much for freighters. 

So before we go there we will be looking into getting minerals needed for plant nutrients and construction. 

So they head over to Thor, which is a rocky, airless moon with even less gravity than Hodor. 

Here they are going to have to spend more time, digging in and getting smelters and refineries running. 

While they are digging they are going to take some of rock on board to process into metal and test their ability to make tethers for space elevators. 

Njord will need one, though even modern day materials would do for that. 

Still we said we have better materials and we will act accordingly. 

Once again they landed in a crater and they began digging into the floor and rim again, and assembling cylinder habitats inside, but not as many because it is mostly just meant for living room. 

There will be hydroponics, which may be expanded to full self-sufficiency later, but for now they are just going to have enough of that for water and air recycling and some fresh produce. 

They are also going to do something a bit weird. 

Onlookers who weren’t paying much attention to mission briefings will notice two larger rocky outcroppings are having cylinders built right up in them, which seems a bit of strange activity. 

They are bit surprised when the the freighters from Hodor arrive with their first shipment a month later and Unity lifts off and rips both of those outcroppings free and drags them along into space. 

Unity has plenty of fuel now and can easily drag an equal mass of rock around these moons. 

When they get to Njord, our bigger moon with a nitrogen atmosphere, one of those big outcroppings gets positioned at stationary orbit and a space elevator goes down with an end attached to a shuttle that goes to land on the surface below. 

Now cargo can come back up that way and go down too. 

Space elevators require counterweights and big thick ones meant for lots of cargo require larger ones plus a port facility, so we just brought one along to serve as counterweight and orbital hub. 

Once more Unity remains for a while to get things in place and to unload cargo and take on a lot of nitrogen. 

Those freighters have probably gone back and forth between Hodor and Thor a few times by now and will start a circuit back and forth between those two moons and the orbital dock on Njord. 

We have now completed a genuine, self-sufficient interstellar colony. 

They don’t really need much trade between them either after the first few rounds, so they really only need two freighters, one as a spare, and they could just meander around on the same circuit, one following the route backwards. 

In fact those two alone probably have far more cargo capacity than would be necessary for centuries to come since they could carry at least a ton of cargo each trip for every single citizen at their destination. 

But the real goal is to colonize Aurora, our Earth-like planet, so we will head there next. 

First though, we are going to drop off a lot of the folks currently planning to leave with Unity. 

We will have to return to pick up fuel and raw material for the ship before it leaves and about half of the folks will remain behind to help with setup and production. 

Most of those will ride back to Hodor and Thor on the freighters. 

We don’t particularly need those for Aurora which seems to have a decent amount of nitrogen in its own atmosphere and oceans. 

Now we did an entire episode on Terraforming and terraforming a planet that is about the mass and temperature of Earth is not too hard. 

We are going arrive in orbit with our remaining orbital hub and deploy it. 

However, this time we will be doing an extra trick. 

Back in the space elevators episode I pointed out that you can have more than one tether running up to the same hub, but with their bases on the ground far apart. 

Sort of like guy wires on a radio mast. 

So long as at least one of those tethers is in the north and south hemisphere each we can keep the hub in equilibrium and can put our tethers wherever we like, not just on the equator. 

This will allow us to cheaply unload to multiple sites and also gives a handy means of traveling back and forth between locations. 

In fact the tethers can meet up before the orbital hub at a lower hub to make surface to surface transport easier. 

There will be a non-stop flow of goods coming down from Unity in large part to test its ability to manufacture tons of goods. 

The ship wasn’t originally meant to be a perpetual mobile factory so while it all works on paper they want to test it. 

Virtually all of those goods, in terms of raw mass, will be glass and struts for domes. 

Those won’t be actual glass but something more like transparent metal, we have stuff these days that we can make like that so presumably they will have something better or gotten the process down better. 

Now I have often pointed out the flaw of the idea of living under glass domes on Mars or the Moon, so it might seem peculiar I’m suggesting it now, but Aurora already has a decently thick atmosphere that burns up meteors so it works here. 

Aurora doesn’t have the right atmosphere mix, it is terribly unlikely any would which didn’t already have life on them, but we will assume the right stuff is there just not in the right mix or density. 

It wouldn’t matter much if the pressure was too high or too low, just so long as it is thick enough to burn up meteors and not so thick sunlight can’t get through or the pressure is so high the domes would need to be as sturdy as a submarine. 

The funny thing is that we don’t just need domes overhead but floors underneath. 

We cannot just assume the native rock will be right for Earth life. 

Not right away. 

You could have a fair amount of heavy metals and radioactive isotopes in the top layer of regolith. 

So you will probably be using tons of vats of algae that you have crushed up local rock into to build up your more Earthlike topsoil. 

This will be a long, long process. 

It won’t be done when Unity gets to its next system, nor likely totally complete when it gets to its tenth stop. 

We have people on this colony that were probably not young when they left Earth and spent 120 years coming here, but they will have to live at least as long before Aurora is a place you can walk around on outside a dome without a breathing mask and possibly a pressure suit. 

It’s not just the land and air either. 

Those oceans probably don’t have the right salt content, and it will take a long time before it can support a full marine ecosystem. 

That process itself is not our main focus today, again we discussed it in the Terraforming episode, but today it is a backdrop for the culture here. 

The folks back around Odin will need years to create the sort of nice cylinder habitats they will be living in. 

Maybe even decades, but their task of making gardens in a bottle is a thousand times easier and faster than terraforming a planet. 

What we have here in this system is three different civilizations already. 

One is set on making a New Earth down on Aurora, a task of centuries before it is achieved. 

One is set on replicating the huge swarms of small asteroids habitats that were springing up everywhere around our own solar system when they left. 

A task for generations too, but with each new one completed within a generation, each created piecemeal, not a whole planet done at once. 

The third has an eternal task. 

Unity will leave this place behind soon on what amounts to a near eternal mission, working for a century at a time en route to their destination before leaving most of their people behind in a new system and repeating the task. 

Cultures adapt to their priorities and generally tend to enshrine them. 

So let’s add to the mix. 

Unity spends a couple years in orbit of Aurora and leaves it with a population of 200,000 as originally planned. 

When it gets back to Odin, those moons and the ship have a combined population of a hundred thousand, probably a little more as people have been getting married and having kids the last few year since they arrived in-system. 

Now those moons had a specific trio of tasks with their own benchmarks, ones they were probably a bit over-prepared for since you tend to be conservative and cautious when drawing up plans for something that’s never been done before and is life and death a hundred years from humanity’s homeworld. 

Their first task was for setting themselves up as a mostly self-sufficient group. 

Their second was tied to that, getting the space infrastructure in place in the Tau Ceti system. 

The third was getting Unity all the raw materials and fuel it needed. 

They have also been receiving updates in technology from Earth this whole time, so besides their benchmarks for success being on the easy side of what they could have done originally, they also have a century of new technology and strategy for colonizing moons and asteroids. 

Plus they have way more people then they originally expected too. 

So they are beyond ahead of schedule. 

Part of their surplus time and energy is going into relaxing and making their homes a bit more luxurious of course. 

Part was getting even more supplies for Unity than was originally planned. 

They’re going to go ahead and do some expansion and improvements on the ship. 

But they also have folks looking around at all of Odin’s other moons and its own collection of Trojan Asteroids and all those extra freighters and thinking some expansion of their own is a good idea. 

All the equipment they are producing is exactly what they need to settle those and the freighters are not doing much. 

We haven’t talked too much about individual family homes, but as I noted back in episode 1 a lot smaller asteroids would work for that. 

The cylinder on board Hyperion we discussed last episode, if it was just a single level with dirt and grass on it, makes for a fairly nice house with a lawn of about one hectare or two acres. 

It’s not an arduous task to make such a cylinder either. 

In a fusion economy, even ignoring the automation you probably have, you can spew out tons of metal plating for pennies on the dollar. 

Especially aluminum, which is costly because of the energy demands of making it, and is a nice lightweight building material that won’t rust. 

So all over these original three moons you probably have a ton of small cylinders going in that are just the equivalent of housing developments or even individual homes. 

Probably manufactured in a big complex and taken to the site, it is very easy to move large and heavy things on an airless moon with very little gravity. 

Not all of those are going in on those three moons. 

So when Unity arrives for resupply they find out that a couple dozen of Odin’s moons have settlements on them now. 

They also find out that a lot of folks who planned to come with them have since changed their minds while others have decided they don’t like the idea of living on these moons or Aurora and sign onboard for Unity’s second mission. 

Lots of people change around their place while Unity is docked for a few months retrofitting. 

Some come back from Aurora, to live around Odin or on Unity, some go off to those other moons and Trojan Asteroids, some leave Unity, and finally the Captain says that’s enough, they are leaving in a week and come tomorrow you are where you are. 

We also have a lot of folks thinking about their original charter drawn up almost 130 years ago back on Earth. 

The situation has changed a lot since then and is going to change a lot more. 

Back in the planning phase they only planned on a small initial space infrastructure, now they have a fairly large one. 

They also have over a century of technological updates from home. 

So how should they govern themselves? 

Folks around Odin make up 20% of their population, not a few percent as originally planned. 

Some on Odin are thinking they should be a separate state. 

Back on the ship they just held popular elections, there were no real districts, now they have districts. 

Each of those three moons around Odin and each of the three landing sites. 

On top of that people are spreading out from the landing sites and to other moons and asteroids. 

For those big six, if they do districts, should they elect their representatives to the system government at large by proportional allocation or one representative per district elected by a majority? 

Ideologies will mutate too. 

Many will want to take that new technology and embrace an even faster rate of terraforming while others will say stick to the original timeline and use that new tech to increase the standard of living. 

Others will suggest the good idea is to keep to both the original timeline and standard of living and divert resources to having and raising more children. 

On top of that, Tau Ceti is an old system, older than Earth, so even though the planet initially appeared lifeless they might find some very basic life deep down in the oceans. 

How would that alter their plans? 

Others might want to use that new technology to make lifeforms which can survive in the existing environment, and over time people might object to replacing that new life with old Earth life. 

It is entirely possible that the ship Unity would barely have left the system before the colony’s unity begins to depart too. 

Even inside the template of democracy there are dozens of major variations and options and thousands of iterations, and as their population grows and their communities become more divergent and distinct it is very unlikely everyone will want to govern themselves the same way even if they maintain some loose system-wide government. 

The next century is bound to see a lot of changes to their colony. 

I imagine news of these changes would catch up to our ship Unity, and be a major source of conversation on board. 

How to do it better next time? 

What to iron out in advance? 

I also find the notion of what sort of culture might develop on board those Gardener Ships as interesting as the colonies. 

As they plod their way out across the galaxy for thousand of years just settling place after place like it was a holy duty, which it might well become to them. 

That is assuming they don’t just stop at some point and ask “Hey, who is actually paying us to do this?” Which also raises the interesting question of what sort of currency they use back on the colony and what they use on the ship itself. 

On the ship the only external thing of value is information from back home and from their daughter colonies they’ve been seeding behind them. 

Technology, culture, and entertainment. 

They can only be paid to continue their mission in that coin, but it is a pretty cheap one to pay people in though very valuable to them. 

On board the ship the situation is a bit different, at each stop they refuel but then have a set amount of raw material and energy to get to the next place which has to be rationed. 

You could get some very interesting cultures and economies on board those. 

Potentially an ever-changing one, but since they also stop every century to leave most of their people behind they also have a pressure vent to remove those people least content with life on the ship. 

So some good food for thought there I hope, we still never have really answered the question of what life in a colony would be like but I think we did reach our goal of not just explaining some of the mechanics of colonization but putting a more human face on it, seeing some of the non-technical challenges. 

To do much more than that we would have to go the route of fiction where we can not only set our specific technologies available but follow along with some characters we can get to know and empathize with. 

There are a lot of great books on that score too, especially on the human front, I can recommend a few: The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, Speaker for the Dead and Ender in Exile by Orson Scott Card, and Ben Bova’s Grand Tour series. 

Next week we will return to the Fermi Paradox Series to discuss the idea of Stay-at-Home Civilizations, the idea that some alien civilizations might never leave their home planet, in contrast to our topic for today. 

We will explore the idea that we might never leave Earth and why that might be.

Life in a Space Colony, ep2: Colony Spaceships
---
  
2016-12-08  
https://youtu.be/THqtAQOicQI  

---

Today’s episode is the second of a three part series we are going to do looking at what life might like on colonies or colonial spaceships. 

Today we are focusing on those ships, mostly on the interstellar kind but also the ones we might use in our own solar system and we will start with those to introduce some concepts about size and spaceships. 

We are not too interested in how they get from point A to point B though. 

We talked about that in the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium and for the interstellar ships I will be assuming they have at least working fusion technology, though as we have discussed before we do have options for interstellar expansion that rely strictly on a mix of solar and fission technology. 

Now to ask ourselves what it is like to be on a colony ship we have to know a lot of particulars about that ship and its mission. 

So we are going to invent a bit of fictional narrative to help us follow along today and we will continue that into episode three. 

We will make some assumptions about the crew, the mission, the ship, and the technology but I will give quick asides about the alternatives as we go. 

I also want to add that I won’t be tailoring my assumptions to what I consider most likely, but what I feel best illustrates the concepts. 

So we will be looking at two scenarios and two ships. 

The first will be a colony ship to Saturn, which we will arbitrarily say is going to include 200 people and last 2 years, from when they leave to when they arrive. 

The second will be an interstellar colony ship to Tau Ceti, 12 light years from here, and it will house 200,000 people and arrive in 120 years. 

What it does when it arrives we will discuss in episode 3. 

To make things simple to follow I will name the first Hyperion, because that is the name of their destination, Saturn’s Moon Hyperion. 

I will name the interstellar one Unity, for my favorite space colonization game, Alpha Centauri. 

That was the name of the ship that brought the folks there. 

Now we will also assume Hyperion is going to be one of the first fusion powered ships and that the technology is still very weak and iffy. 

It can run life support and an ion drive. 

Hyperion also has a mission, it is going to get to its moon of the same name and start mining and manufacturing a space elevator to be used on its neighbor, Titan, where a much bigger colony is planned. 

Hyperion is a pretty big ship, people will be on it for two years and it had to be constructed in space. 

It’s about 200 meters from stem to stern and about 50 wide and high, it also masses out around 100,000 tons, on par with an aircraft carrier, though much of that is reaction mass for the ion drive. 

But everyone lives in the Habitation Module, which is a series of ten nested cylinders each spaced a bit over head-height apart, and all rotating 6 times a minute to simulate Earth normal gravity of one gee on the outermost, ‘bottom’ deck and 90% less on the floor above. 

One handy aspect of nested, layered rotating habitats is that if they are all spinning at the same rate their gravity and floor space is proportional to their radius, so the cylinder half as wide as the outermost one will have half the gravity and half the floor area. 

We’ve got ten so the gravity is all 10%, 20%, 30%, etc. 

The Habitation Module is about as long as it is wide, and only about a quarter of the ship. 

It has one more non-spinning layer outside it with a vacuum sleeve to keep the friction down and you enter and exit it through the two necks on Deck 1, which is basically just a long corridor between those with ladders and stairs down. 

The rest of the ship, which is most of it, is pressurized but has no gravity and is on the cool side. 

It’s all cargo, fuel, and a couple workshops where gravity isn’t necessary or maybe unwelcome. 

The folks who go out there to grab supplies or work there wear sweaters and have space heaters in their workshops. 

The engineers who keep the engines and power plant from breaking work out here so it is no surprise they tend to be a cranky lot. 

Anyway someone on the ship has to be cranky and I don’t want that to be the doctor. 

I know ship’s doctors are supposed to be cantankerous sorts who will smoke a cigarette while examining you but ours need to be friendly, as we will see in a bit. 

This is not the first colony ship, there are already tons of colonies closer into the sun mostly running on solar power and providing all the metal for the huge industrial complexes orbiting Earth and other places. 

Most have been around long enough they’d like to expand but to do that they need to grow more food on site and they need nitrogen to do that. 

They need thousands of tons of it, and that’s why Titan, with its dense nitrogen atmosphere, is now a desirable colony. 

With the space elevator in place there it will be able to cheaply ship tons of nitrogen into the inner and middle solar system colonies. 

Hyperion is the one that will manufacture that elevator and get the docks and industries in place for rapid expansion on Titan. 

It wasn’t easy to recruit for, it’s not a prestigious job and space isn’t that prestigious anymore, a few million people already live and work in space, albeit mostly in low earth orbit, so a two year trip to the edge of nowhere wasn’t something that had lines stretching out of the recruitment center. 

This makes life a bit hard on the ship’s captain, the ship’s cook, and the ship’s doctor. 

When they left they found out that the company contracted to hire on all the miners and manufacturing teams was getting a bit desperate and would take anyone with the right skills, many of who don’t have much past history. 

Or rather they probably do have a lot of history, they are just trying to leave it all behind. 

So when our doctor goes to open up his patient files and history’s he’s horrified to find out that almost half of them consist of name, age, and blood type and nothing else. 

This isn’t a scientific voyage either, so he hasn’t got any fancy DNA analyzers. 

We know what his life on the ship is going to be like for the next two years. 

Morning, coffee, appointments all day except for emergencies. 

Checkups, of course, even on the folks in seemingly great health. 

And trying to pry information about patient and family histories out of taciturn crewmembers, many of who get touchy, evasive, or even angry when you ask about their family medical history. 

Plus he’s trying to deal with the ship’s hypochondriac, who is convinced he has every illness known to man including some fictional ones. 

And the ship’s psychologist hasn’t dealt with that yet because he’s busy dealing with Dave, the ship’s navigator, who is convinced the ship’s computer is out to get him. 

On top of that the ship’s captain keeps pestering him to let her look at the files on the crew he has gathered because she has the exact same problem of wanting to know everyone’s background but having scant personnel files to work with and the last time he mentioned doctor-patient confidentiality covering those files she gave him detailed instructions on where he could file any complaints about confidentiality. 

Now we’ve got the cook who spends a lot of his time on the upper decks where the gravity is low because plants don’t much care about gravity besides using it to orient themselves off of. 

Most of the upper decks are for hydroponics and even deck 1, which is mostly a wide corridor, has plants all over it. 

A few dozen of the crew work on these levels, just growing food to supplement their supplies and he’s up there a lot with his assistants grabbing plants for meals and arguing with the ship’s botanist about what should be getting grown. 

For a trip shorter than a few years you don’t actually benefit from growing food, except to supplement your diet with some fresh produce and to help recycle your air and water. 

You can pack around a year’s worth of food for one person into a cubic meter if you have to and there’s a cutoff point where all the equipment you need for growing food will mass more than the amount of food it will grow. 

But their colony is going to be expected to grow all its own food so right now they have been converting every extra space into more gardens to further stretch out there original supplies and to get more people trained to do it. 

The manufacturing teams have been getting practice recycling the old food storage packaging into more hydroponics trays and it’s not all hydroponics anymore either. 

The ship didn’t start off with any dirt and soil on board, but it seems to be acquiring it at a rate of about 100 kilograms a day, non-coincidentally about the dry weight of food consumed each day. 

They also are not vegetarians so they have chickens, fish, and some goats on board. 

No cows, too heavy and messy. 

But they’ve got goat’s milk for some dairy and eggs from chickens and the fish are intricately connected to their hydroponics. 

That’s not their only animals either, so they have a veterinarian. 

At some point in the history spaceflight some lazy scientists let the lab rats escape and ever since there have been rats on ships and space stations and that gave people an excuse to have cats and that led to dogs because if cat-lovers get their pets you can’t go leaving man’s best friend behind, and ferrets too because they’re more useful. 

Now all the people live down on the bottom deck where gravity is what it should be. 

It’s not that cramped at all. 

That bottom deck has almost 8000 square meters of floor space and with only 200 of them, they could each get away with a fairly comfortable 10 square meter personnel cabin and still have only used a quarter of that deck. 

The rest being common areas like gyms, the cafeteria, the bathrooms, and so on. 

We will find that the further ahead we go in spaceflight the more living space ships tend to have. 

We have talked about this before, especially in the arcologies and impact of fusion episodes where we got a bit more specific about how much energy you need for each person when you have to make your own sunlight for plants and what it converts into is that you basically are controlled in population by how much heat you can get rid of, which in space can only be done by radiation, which in turn is controlled by the outer surface area of your ship. 

This isn’t an issue for our ship Hyperion yet, but it will be a big one for Unity, our interstellar version, which we will get too soon. 

I have opted, semi-arbitrarily, to put the exterior surface area needed for each person, to get rid of all the heat associated to keeping them alive and happy, at 100 square meters. 

This would correspond to a power budget of about 40 to 50 kilowatts per person, though also has to include the energy lost to heat in the reactor while it produces the electricity they need, which itself will mostly be artificial, spectrum-tailored sunlight to grow plants. 

Again those aforementioned episodes discuss the nuts and bolts of that. 

Hyperion’s Hull is close to two hundred thousand square meters, which would let you purge close to 100 megawatts of heat, about an order of magnitude more than the ship is producing to keep the crew happy. 

Hence why the areas outside the habitation module are cold. 

They also could have gotten away with more people on the ship, maybe ten times as many, but let’s talk technology real quick and distinguish a passenger ship from a colony ship. 

A Colony ship needs to build its colony when it arrives, a passenger ship needs to just carry people. 

Now we often consider having robots arrive and build everything, or colonists who don’t need much equipment because they can make it on site. 

Ships following the robots with people, or that don’t need much gear, are not colony ships anymore than a passenger plane carrying some migrants from New York to Omaha is. 

Even if that entire plane was chartered to carry folks who were planning to move and become farmers, it isn’t a colony plane, they aren’t bringing their tractors with them. 

Hyperion is a colony ship, it is mostly cargo, it is going to flat out land in a crater on the moon Hyperion and everyone is going to keep living in that habitat module for months or even years afterwards as they unpack and expand and get their colony going. 

So it is mostly cargo and they have plenty of space, their real limit on space was making sure they could keep everyone warm, because even their hull and shielding material is cargo they are going to eventually cannibalize to build with, using local rock to replace most of the radiation shielding. 

If Hyperion was a passenger ship they’d probably only need a few kilowatts for each person, because they’d only be growing some food to freshen up their diets and recycle air and water. 

Though it still wouldn’t be particularly cramped because building large in space is a lot easier and doesn’t cost you as much, relatively speaking, but colony ships will never be cramped because of the need for a lot of cargo space, which in space actually means cargo mass, and a lot of construction material can serve double duty as part of the ship’s hull. 

I don’t just mean in the sense that you could recycle it, though any spacefaring civilization needs to be very good at recycling, but in the sense that a ship’s hull is almost entirely about radiation shielding, not keeping space in and air out, which a hull a thick as a soda can will do. 

Your crate of solar panels can be opened up and pinned against the hull instead of boxed up, to add shielding. 

Your tanks of water can be on the hull, to provide shielding, so can your fuel, and so on. 

All right, let’s move on to the interstellar side of things. 

About a year ago we did an episode on Interstellar Colonization where we looked more at the mechanics of spaceflight, but I mentioned there 5 categories of colony ship. 

We will be adding a sixth one today, which is what Unity will be, but let us review the original five. 

Those were, #1, Methuselah Ships, ones that take a long time to arrive but the crew is nearly immortal so it is the same people arriving as left a century before. 

We assume someone has cracked a way to extend life indefinitely or nearly so. 

#2, Sleeper Ships, where all or most of the crew are on ice for the duration of the voyage. 

#3, Generation Ships, where people live their normal lifespan and it is their children and grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren who colonize the new world. 

#4, Seed Ships. 

These are heavily automated ships, typically with no human crews, that arrive with frozen DNA material and set about colonizing and terraforming a new planet with follow up passenger ships ready to arrive at premade facilities, or even having humans grown in tanks and raised and educated by those machines. 

#5 was data ships, where we skip the organic part entirely, either because the people are digitized themselves, or maybe were artificial intelligences already, or the organic component was stored strictly digitally, we can print DNA after all. 

Now we detailed those more in the Interstellar colonization episode but I want add a sixth category, Gardener ships, which I basically made up last week, and also discuss the misconception about freezing people. 

Let’s do that first. 

Cryogenics is an awesome technology, because it lets us freeze people now and hopefully resurrect them down the road. 

We can’t do that yet, and what a lot of people miss is that the technology you need to resurrect human popsicles is automatically the same one needed to extend their life indefinitely. 

We might figure out some way to extend lifespans without medical nanotechnology but you need that to bring people back to life after freezing them. 

The simple ability to unfreeze humans implies a near certainty you can also repair all the damage associated to aging. 

So category two, Sleeper Ships, would not exist to ensure your crew didn’t die of old age. 

That only leaves keeping them alive the whole time or keeping them out of the way as a hassle. 

But it is never an issue to keep people alive on an interstellar spaceship because the kinds of energies needed to get any ship up to interstellar speeds is just huge compared to the energy needed to provide life support even over thousand year long journeys. 

Your power limitation on an interstellar ship is only about getting rid of the heat you produce, because the energy needed to run that ship is tiny compared to accelerating and decelerating even if you are only going 1% of light speed and your voyage will be a thousand years long. 

If you are going ten percent of light speed you need a hundred times the energy to get to that speed and your life support needs are cut to a tenth, as the voyage only last a tenth as long. 

Proportionally it now makes up a thousandth of the energy budget the 1% of light speed ship needed to keep people alive, which was already small compared to its acceleration and deceleration needs. 

We will be assuming for Unity, our example interstellar colony ship, that it is traveling at 10% of light speed, which is about the top speed fusion permits. 

Now fusion fuel is stupid cheap, it is the most abundant stuff in the Universe, so you can bring as much cargo as you want at those speeds. 

Our two big alternative power sources for higher speeds, antimatter or black holes, are likely to be quite expensive as fuel sources so even if you have them you probably opt for lower speeds for colony ships, half the speed, four times the cargo minimum for the same fuel. 

Passenger ships might go a lot faster, ditto seed or data ships, but a colony ship constructed to carry people and cargo in quantity will be better off taking its time and arriving with more equipment and manpower. 

So you only freeze people if they just want to skip the voyage, because if you have the tech to unfreeze them they are also able to live indefinitely. 

If you don’t then you have to use generation ships anyway, because you lack the technology to extend life, unfreeze people, or to use seed or data ships. 

This kinda raises a problem. 

The whole point of a colony is to spread humanity out and increase our numbers, so your preferred colonist likes children and doesn’t mind roughing it a bit, compared to the standard of living back home at least. 

They might consider ‘roughing it’ to mean they have to work a couple hours every day and their home only has twenty rooms in it. 

But they key thing is that your colony ship does not have a static population. 

You can force that, with the immortal methuselah ship you say no kids till we arrive and get the colony setup, for the generation ship you tell people no more kids than are needed to replace those dying of old age and accidents. 

But the funny thing is you don’t really need to and might be better off not doing it. 

You’ve got these ships that are going to be cruising through space for decades and are assumed to be equipped specifically to allow you to engage in a ton of in situ construction. 

They are the result of decades if not centuries of practice back in our solar system of setting colonies up to manufacture almost everything they need on site and an interstellar colony has to be able to manufacture everything on site. 

Not right away but they need to make everything except new technology there. 

Earth can keep beaming the colonists new scientific and technological breakthroughs, just a few years out of date from the light lag for data to arrive. 

But an interstellar colony has to make everything they need, including replacing all their machines for making things, and fixing anything the ship needs too. 

So first off, with a 120 year voyage to Tau Ceti, our ship Unity doesn’t need its colonist fully trained when it leaves. 

It doesn’t matter if the colonists are immortal or the grandchildren of the original colonists because they still have 120 years to train. 

Unity is not a ship carrying colonists and colonial equipment anymore, it is a place that manufactures colonists and colonizing equipment. 

If it is a generation ship it constantly needs to birth and train new people with all the knowledge and skills needed, and they probably need to work to maintain their gear. 

So I am just going to assume Unity was a Methuselah ship where half the folks opted to be frozen and half did not, and before arriving they will have doubled their population. 

Nice even thirds. 

During the voyage they also got some tech updates from home that made colonizing and staying alive on that ship a bit easier, and that’s why they decided they could have children. 

They probably also had extra sleeper pods to accommodate anyone who changed their mind part way there or as spares and they could manufacture more if they needed to. 

Personally though, I can’t imagine going on ice to relieve boredom. 

I don’t think the ship would be boring and even if it was I have thousands of books and shows and films to get around to reading and at least that many being beamed to us from home every year. 

I might even decide to make some of my own. 

I, personally, could keep making these videos and sending them home the whole trip. 

They’d be years old when they arrived but they’d be new to the audience. 

And this isn’t a ship of a few people or a few hundred, it’s a ship of a few hundred thousand. 

We are transplanting humanity to a new star system. 

So let’s scale up Hyperion, ten times wider, conveniently the ideal diameter of a rotating habitat as it allows full earth gravity at only two rotation per minute, which does not appear to cause any problems at all for anyone. 

Now let’s make it ten times longer too. 

Otherwise identical. 

We now have a ship with a thousand times the volume but only a hundred times the surface area so it can only purge 100 times the heat, enough to let us support 200,000 people comfortably. 

Probably a good deal more. 

We will assume when we left we had 200,000 people and half went on ice and half remained awake. 

When we arrive we will have a 100,000 sleepers, 100,000 more who lived through the entire flight, and another 100,000 who were born along the way. 

Now with improvements made since we left we figure we can easily squeeze in another 100,000 people if we had to do this all over again, supporting those 300,000 all awake if we wanted to. 

But we arrive with 300,000 this time. 

Many of those who spent the entire journey awake or who were born en route are no longer entirely happy with the idea of settling at Tau Ceti. 

The ship is now home. 

The ship can be repaired and refueled, and it would have a whole century to the next star to turn raw materials into new colonial equipment. 

Heck they could even expand the ship at Tau Ceti if they wanted to, they could settle the next system even better with all the new tech and improvements sent from Earth and from the first interstellar colonization effort at Alpha Centuari, which is already up and running and has been for decades now. 

The provisional governor of the colony checks with the people now that the frozen ones are awake and it turns out many do like the idea of staying on the ship to go colonize another system. 

It doesn’t have to be a lot, they can breed up new people in the century to the next destination. 

So he tells them that Unity will remain to help set ups the colonies for a few years and to get refueled and get raw materials, then they can leave with anyone who still wants to go or has since decided to do so. 

Now it is essentially a new type of colony ship, which I will call a Gardener Ship, because it can just keep working its way out to ever new solar systems, traveling for a few generations to replace their people and manufacture new colonial equipment and dropping a chunk off at each new system. 

Each time some elect to remain behind on the colony and others on the ship. 

Rinse and Repeat, all the way to the edge of the galaxy maybe. 

They could stop forever at any system they wanted to or pause for a generation if they wanted to or even divide the ship to make two, like an amoeba, to cover two new lines of colonization. 

And in many way this isn’t a ship to get to colonies, it is a colony all on its own. 

With a couple hundred thousand people it has its own farms and factories, and its schools and universities to train colonists, but it has everything else too. 

Its own shopping centers and restaurants and probably landmarks and monuments. 

As it plows through space to the next system it will probably have a great big monument built on some deck to each colony it founded for instance. 

It will get its entertainment and science from back on Earth and colonies it founded but it will make its own and develop its own customs and traditions. 

I have to admit the Gardener Ships, seeding world after world, appeal to me a lot. 

I’d enjoy being crew on something like that. 

I mean if you’re immortal I can think of worse ways to spend your time than being an officer on some ship meandering out toward the edge of the galaxy, stopping every few decades for a couple years to seed a new colony. 

And if you got bored with it you could always stay at the newest colony and give up your crew slot to some person born on the most recent leg of the eternal journey that thought crewing a ship would be more fun than being a colonist. 

I’m not sure how practical Gardener Ships would be compared to one-shot ships constantly sent out from back at Earth or the nearest system that was populated enough to want to make their own, but they sound cool and an interesting aspect of that would be that each new colony would have neighbors near them with a shared background and relatives, which might make interstellar relations easier. 

I can imagine getting on one and staying on it for thousands of years, maybe even going on ice from time to time, and getting out to the edge of the galaxy and looking at the others and saying ‘why not?’ and just sailing off to another galaxy. 

It’s fun to daydream, kind of what the purpose of this channel is for, we just try to give it a little formal solidity of science. 

All right, so that’s life on a colony ship, next week we finish out with those passengers arriving at their new solar system of Tau Ceti.

Life in a Space Colony, ep1: Extraterrestrial Colonies
---
  
2016-12-01  
https://youtu.be/VIMV6E8OxG8  

---

Today’s episode is the first of a three part series we are going to do looking at what life might be like on colonies or colonial spaceships. 

We normally focus so much on the technology and mechanics of extraterrestrial colonies or ships that we mostly ignore what day-to-day life would be like and it seemed time to rectify that a bit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there are a few reasons we have avoided this in the past. 

First, colony life is going to vary a lot on what technology is available, you don’t need to have people growing food if you have robots who can do all the work for instance. 

Second, we don’t know what the people will be like, because it is entirely possible, even likely, that what passes for human on colonies would be a cyborg or genetically tweaked human or even an outright digital person. 

And third, we don’t know how they’d behave because we don’t their motivations. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are looking at day-to-day life and how the place governs itself, that will depend a lot on why those colonists decided to become colonists in the first place. 

Traditionally it takes a lot of motivation to get people to up and leave their life behind but what that motive is can be a lot different for each colony and each individual. 

We are going to try to set the stage for better considering what colony life would actually be like, and that means we will be spending a fair amount of time, especially in this first episode, still talking about a lot of the mechanics. 

Fortunately, we have discussed a lot of those in the past too so I will occasionally reference those episodes to save time. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to asking why we would colonize other places, what our motives will be, and how colonists might govern themselves, we will draw on some historical examples for insights. 

However we also want to avoid letting ourselves be trapped in a box by history. 

While I can empathize with King Solomon’s world-weary assertion that there is nothing new under the sun, I don’t think anyone alive today can take that comment as true at face value. 

There are just too many changes to our civilization in terms of technology, culture, and day-to-day life to think we can treat any historic event as a strong guide to future events. 

So while we will draw on a lot of historical examples of previous colonies in this and the follow-up episodes, we will also try to look for parallels in modern times and take both with a sizable grain of salt. 

To truly explore this topic there are some questions we need to ask ourselves about any given colony and any given colonist. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some of the most important questions we should be thinking about for the colony itself: 1. 

What is its purpose? 

2. 

Who is founding it, and why? 

3. 

Where is it, relative to the Earth and Sun? 

4. 

How big is the object being settled? 

5. 

What are the object's characteristics? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is it’s purpose? 

Is it a scientific outpost? 

Is it a money making one? 

Mining for platinum or growing food or building ships. 

Is it a national extension? 

Something fully backed and supported by a country getting its footholds in space? 

Maybe it is a religious or ideological one. 

It could have more than one purpose too, and almost certainly will have at least secondary goals. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will depend a lot on who is founding it and why. 

If I’m part of religious denomination that puts a lot of value on farming, I might decide to found an agricultural colony. 

So my motive is principally religious but it is also presumably a money-making one focused on exporting food. 

Needless to say that is going to dominate where I want to put it since you need sunlight to grow food and you need people to buy that food. 

So where the colony is, relative to the Earth and Sun, matters a lot. 

Even if you’ve got cheap fusion to use instead of sunlight. 

It also will control the time lag on all communications, which also means a longer response time for any problem where you need expert help from back home. 

Also, the further out you are, the more isolated your colony is, and the more expensive it will be to set the colony up or to import replacement components and consumables. 

On the other hand if I’m from a religious or ideological group that is very isolationist and doesn’t want to be around bad influences, the further and deeper out in space, the better. 

We also need to know how big the object is. 

Is it a planet? 

A large moon? 

And Asteroid or Comet? 

This controls some of our ultimate ends for that colony. 

A martian Colony might want to take some steps to accustom people to lower gravity, genetic engineering perhaps, while ironically places with lower gravity probably would not. 

Mars has enough gravity to hold an atmosphere too, and a roughly earth length day, so that they might seriously consider full blown terraforming of that planet. 

Alternatively your average asteroid that is only a few kilometers across, and even most moons and comets, are better thought of as an egg you plan to grow inside and eventually hatch out of, into a colony far bigger than that asteroid was when you started. 

This will depend on what the other characteristics of the object are: what it is made of. 

Is it high in metals? 

Is it high in organic elements? 

Is it drifting by itself or in a large group of other bodies, like a collection of moons? 

Next we need to ask why any given colonist would want to become a colonist. 

If we want to know what life would be like on one, that depends a lot on physical characteristics of the colony, in terms of the resources it has and the technology available. 

It also depends on the motivations and goals of the colonists. 

Both as individuals, and as a group. 

It is pretty normal for instance for a young couple to become colonists and they may already have children too. 

Either way odds are one of them is more enthusiastic about it then the other. 

So you could easily end up with half of your colonists there who are a bit lukewarm about it. 

That can change with time too, I can think of any number of trips I made or events I attended at the insistence of friends who were very excited about it where I turned out to have a great time, and sometimes they felt disappointed afterwards. 

In any given colony you should expect a broad spectrum of motives, goals, and personalities, depending on how strict your recruitment guidelines are and how good you are at screening for those desired traits, of course. 

I also want to emphasize that when I say colony, I mean a place where people plan to set up shop for the long term and have families. 

Now it might be a dedicated zero-growth place that plans to begin at 1000 people and stay that way till the end of time, or their idea of family might differ a lot from our own, like if they grew their new people in tanks till adulthood, but I’d still call those colonies. 

The motives of the colony overall and individually will control a lot of how it grows and functions. 

One started by a group of anarchists and one started as a marxist commune are going to have very different priorities from each other and won’t be like one meant to be a Catholic colony. 

I don’t want to oversimplify any of those groups and their goals but the anarchist group would probably want to emphasize individual homes more than the commune in their first construction, while the Catholics might want their first building to be a large church everyone could take their meals and sleep in while homes were built. 

Some folks might just be there to make money and plan to leave, and that could include a lot of senior colony personnel like the doctor or lawyer or administrative specialist who isn’t even interested in the goal of the colony just doing their job there until their contract expires or they get promoted to a position elsewhere. 

So the motives control why people are establishing a colony and will tell us at least as much about life on that colony as what technology we have. 

But there also certain categories of objects for colonization we need to consider too. 

When it comes to categorization there are tons, but we have three major ones we need to consider. 

How big is the object being colonized? 

How close is it to the Sun? 

And how close is it to other objects? 

Let’s discuss that last one first. 

Things are very different if you’ve got one rock all alone a billion miles from its nearest neighbor as opposed to a small collection of asteroids or moons all close enough you could have a real time telephone conversation. 

It also controls how self-sufficient you need to be, since not only do communications travel slower but trade will take longer too. 

This would also cost more in terms of actual cost and lost time. 

You also might not want to pick a cluster of asteroids even if the others were uninhabited at the time. 

A body 10 kilometers across has about the same mass and resources as eight bodies half as wide, 5 kilometers across, but it is probably easier to make sure your colony has sole claim on that one body than all eight and you might not want neighbors. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to how big the object is, I’ve decided to break everything into just six sizes. 

Less than a kilometer across, less than 10 kilometers across, less than a hundred, less than a thousand, less than ten thousand, and less than a hundred thousand. 

And I’ll call those 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. 

We could imagine a category 6 but only Jupiter itself would be that big, as would brown dwarfs, and today we’re not interested in any of our gas giants, except their moons, though we may look at colonizing them directly in the future. 

Now this is a measure of diameter by order of magnitude so it is a bit arbitrary but in a raw sense each category is 10 times wider but also a thousand time more massive than the last, and so could presumably support a thousand times the population. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I also picked these to highlight the importance of gravity. 

Almost every celestial object you probably know the name of is category 4 or 5. 

Earth, Venus, and all the Gas Giants except Jupiter are fives. 

These are also the only places you could expect to find the gravity comfortable and not need to worry about health issues. 

They also have no problem holding an atmosphere. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you get down to category 4 though, these are the objects that are where classic terraforming is probably possible but will take a lot of work, probably including some genetic engineering or such to make animals and people safe against the ailments we associate to low gravity. 

Though I should note we don’t know for sure what those are. 

We know what zero-gravity or micro-gravity does to the body, but we genuinely don’t know how much gravity would be needed to avoid or mitigate those effects. 

Mars and Mercury for instance, at the high end of category 4, might be just fine on their own. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the same note, most of these objects could hold an atmosphere if you were willing to work to maintain it. 

This category includes Mars, Mercury, Pluto and all the other dwarf planets, and the sixteen biggest moons in the solar system including our own. 

Let me qualify that, it technically would not include Ceres, the largest asteroid or closest dwarf planet to the sun, which is just under a thousand kilometers, and the only asteroid in the belt with a real claim on dwarf planet status, and some of the other dwarf planet candidates come in at 900 km or so. 

I will include those in category 4 just so we can say all the categories below this are those where the objects are now only spherical from general coincidence, not gravity. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing below this category can be expected to have reasonably uniform gravity over the entire surface or not cause serious low-gravity issues or hold an atmosphere without a dome over it. 

On any of these places you could expect to discharge a pistol and have the bullet land on the ground eventually, beneath this category it would go flying off into space. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of notes. 

First, if you add up all the category 4, 5 and 6 objects in the solar system, and probably most other solar systems, you won’t get into triple digits. 

There’s about thirty such objects in our solar system. 

On the other hand there are about 200 countries on this planet and several times that number if we included every sub-division, ethnicity, religion, or ideology big enough to count as its own country. 

The sorts of places or groups who could get their hands on a billion bucks if they need to. 

You don’t necessarily need to be a country to have a colony. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now those 30 objects aren’t enough for everyone to have one of their own, which is okay because those places could all host dozens or even thousands of unique colonies and they could come from any number of nations or groups, but it would be hard for one nation back here to just claim total ownership of, say, Mars. 

So the smaller objects, the Category 3 kind, the ones between a hundred and a thousand kilometers in radius, get a lot more tempting. 

At least if you want one rock of your own, because there are a few hundred of those in the solar system, so you could start thinking about making a singular claim on one of those. 

When we get to category 2, 10-100 km across, there’s several thousand of those just in the Asteroid Belt alone and many thousands of others, and it is easy to forget that any one of those could easily be turned into a place that could comfortably house an entire planetary population, I’ll explain that in a bit. 

But there’s enough of them that anybody with the resources to be thinking about having a colony could stake a singular claim to at least one. 

Now these can’t be classically terraformed but we’ll get to that in a bit too. 

Your category 1 objects, 1-10 km, are also quite attractive objects, being the size of a mountain or metropolis and numbering in the hundreds of thousands just in the asteroid belt alone. 

There’s probably many millions further out when we throw in Comets, Kuiper Belt objects, and stuff out in the Oort Cloud. 

These are also great colony prospects because as we’ll see they could be transformed into places that would be nice sized countries in their own right. 

Even our category 0 objects, those less than a kilometer across, make for nice colonies if you’re only trying to make something that could support a fairly decent sized community that was fairly self-sufficient. 

These sizes also tell us a lot about how stuff reaches the colony and where people live. 

Category 4 objects mostly don’t have atmospheres but can maybe have them, and can also have space elevators on them that don’t need to be made out of super materials. 

Beneath this, while space elevators can still work in some cases, they mostly don’t serve any purpose. 

Ships just land and take off and in a lot cases can do so with virtually no fuel expenditure. 

Or even no fuel expenditure, many would be able to get away with having a runway where a magnet or tow cable just dragged them up to speed or where they literally just collided with a spring or the colony just snagged them with a magnet on a tether and slowly halted them and reeled them in. 

That changes the game a lot, especially in a place like the asteroid belt, which while nowhere near as dense as fiction often portrays it, could easily have the equivalent to passenger planes or buses or even cars that just went back and forth to nearby asteroids. 

You could have individual asteroid homes, small village equivalents or even single family residences people could essentially drive to the bigger asteroids from. 

A 100 meter wide asteroid, a category negative one I suppose, would be nice for this purpose and there are tens of millions of those in the Belt. 

Now they are separated by hundreds of thousands of miles from each other but that’s maybe a day of travel tops and what’s more it’s only a seconds of light lag on any communication. 

Plus, you can just move one. 

I mean we’ve talked about moving whole solar systems and even galaxies on this channel, moving a rock the size of a mansion through the void of space to be a million kilometers close to a bigger asteroid colony barely even qualifies as a task. 

So you could just shove your asteroid to a 100 kilometers away from some Category 2 or 3 asteroid and fly over to it to go shopping. 

We’ve talked before about hollowing out asteroids and slowly disassembling them to reassemble them as megastructures, but you can also latch them together quite easily. 

The gravitational force between two asteroids in the 10 kilometer diameter range, say 20 kilometers apart, is low enough you wouldn’t even have to mess around with putting them into orbit of each other, you could literally hold them apart with a rigid metal shaft. 

A decently thick and sturdy one, but nothing requiring massive feats of engineering or super-science. 

You could even snatch smaller asteroids with a very long tether and reel them in. 

We’ll come back to this stuff in a bit, but let us address our other category type first, distance from the Sun. 

Now I say distance from the Sun but I also mean Earth. 

Except for Mercury and Venus and maybe Mars and the Near Earth Asteroids this is essentially the same thing. 

We discussed the inner and outer solar system recently, breaking them at the asteroid belt, but I want to break into 5 more distinct categories today &nbsp;instead: &nbsp;Inner, middle, outer, deep, and Extrasolar. 

Here I will consider Inner to be any place as close to the Sun as Earth or closer. 

Of Natural objects that is Mercury, Venus, Earth, the Moon, and the Near Earth Asteroids. 

But as those of you familiar with the channel know, we would often be thinking about making artificial habitats all over this volume as a build up to a Dyson Swarm. 

Here light is not only more than abundant enough to grow plants and use solar power, which is great in space since there’s no night time or clouds, but actually can be so abundant you might need to take steps to block it. 

The Inner region is also where communications are fast. 

Not only is there likely to be plenty of people living within real-time communication distance with you, where a phone call might just feel a little slow, but you can talk to anyone in the inner region within minutes not hours. 

Even a call to the other side of the inner region and the return time on an answer is only half an hour. 

I will count Mars and the Asteroid Belt as the Middle Solar System and also Jupiter and its moons and trojan asteroids. 

This is the region where there’s not a lot of sunlight but it is still plentiful enough to either grow plants and use with solar panels or at least wouldn’t need much augmentation. 

Out past Jupiter, as I’ve mentioned before, solar is still an option but not a very good one. 

Everything has to be scaled up massively to acquire and concentrate the kind of power you need. 

Technically you can live on solar power anywhere in the galaxy or even the Universe since there is a decent amount of ambient light, but even ignoring that you would need panel and mirror arrays the size of football stadium to power a lightbulb, you have to consider the sheer construction and maintenance costs compared to just buying some uranium to run a fission plant. 

It’s still semi-viable in the outer region, which I consider to be from Saturn out through the Kuiper Belt, but these are not places for serious colonization until you have fusion or can at least have huge solar arrays near the sun beaming energy out to colonies. 

So out in this region, with the exception of a couple of the larger moons, surface habitation is just pointless. 

It exposes you to radiation and micrometeors, but the sun is still bright enough you could comfortably walk around without a flashlight during the day. 

Type 4, Deep Space, out past the Kupier Belt, is where space is incredibly uncomfortable and totally your enemy. 

There’s no point having anything on the surface of whatever iceball you’ve settled besides your landing spots, which would probably have retractable armored shutters over them, and your transmitters and receivers and maybe an observation dome or two because the night sky is likely to be a rather pleasant sight out there. 

You could conceivably still use solar by beamed energy out here. 

That’s actually a cheap trick for moving comets into the solar system, you coat one side with solar panels and beam energy to it to power an ion thruster that uses some of the ice as propellant. 

Fission remains possible too but I just don’t see the point, you might get a colony or two out there just prove it could be done but nobody would develop this region seriously until fusion was cheap and easy, in which case every object out there looks like a giant tank of gasoline. 

As to our last category, extrasolar, that will be our topic for our third video though it could technically include stuff that was so far out it didn’t count as part of our solar system anymore. 

Those are the same as deep space habitats for all practical purposes though. 

Now before we abandon talking about solar power entirely as an option, I did want to bring up slight addendum to something I call a mushroom habitat. 

We introduced those when discussing Mercury in the two-parter with Fraser Cain a few weeks back and I should probably note I coined that term, though I’m sure someone came up with the concept before. 

One of things about futurism is you do have to coin terms sometimes and you just cross your fingers if you come up with a bad or silly one, that someone renames it. 

The funny thing is that the idea started backwards. 

The Mercury version is meant to shield you from sunlight, and that trick works on habitats near the sun too, if you need a place for people to live who are tending to massive solar arrays placed as close to the sun as they can be without melting. 

Simple setup, mushroom side toward the sun to block light, reflective surface to bounce most of it away. 

But my original version was backwards for deeper out in space. 

Big rotating cylinder habitat at the stem out where the sun is getting a bit weak for use, and behind it is the mushroom cap as a parabolic dish reflecting in concentrated sunlight. 

So if solar is your power source you would expect an awful lot of the asteroid, small moon, or free floating habitats to use this scheme out in the middle regions past Earth out to Jupiter, and maybe further too. 

I should probably have just called those a parabolic dish habitat but mushroom sounds neater. 

It’s also a great setup to receive beamed power further out if you need to go that route, so figure on anything past Mars using this sort of setup if they have not got fusion. 

Beyond things like that, except for those thirty or so objects which might have enough gravity or might be augmented by combining spin gravity and local gravity, the colonies ought to look a lot alike. 

Everybody lives inside. 

We have talked about rotating habitats more times than I can count so I won’t go over that again. 

Of course you do always have the option of either non-uniform gravity by not making your cylinder radially symmetric, like a pair of connected cones instead. 

Or just telling gravity to take a hike and just taking whatever measures are necessary to make your population and attached flora and fauna able to survive in microgravity. 

You can combine rotating habitats and zero gravity environments too, in fact the easiest way to connect rotating habitats is with hubs that don’t have gravity, which would let you produce huge networks of cylinder habitats in two or three dimensions. 

You would probably expand into your asteroid by making more cylinders inside and take excess material to cover over ones built outside it, as protective shielding, or shipped off as exports for trade. 

This is what I meant about being able to turn a Category 3 object into something that could hold an entire planetary population. 

Even just a hollowed out asteroid packed with cylinders is going to be vastly larger in living area than the surface of that asteroid was, but you can build outward too, taking that hollowed out material and basically dumping it around the outside of a big balloon you just inflated as needed until all the matter was either in the cylinders or in that outer shell. 

You could cannibalize that too and just replace it with a layer of compressed hydrogen or something. 

Hydrogen is great for blocking radiation, incredibly abundant, and the fuel for fusion anyway. 

That’s way down the line though, not technologically, just that it would take centuries before we would fill up all the normal, unmodified rocks. 

There’s no hard and fast rule about how thick the floor should be on a rotating habitat, especially since you can do multiple levels, but I usually just use a ton per square meter as a ballpark figure. 

In that context a 10 kilometer wide asteroid, the cutoff between category 2 and 3, masses out at about a trillion tons and so a trillion square meters or a million square kilometers, about the size of Egypt or five times larger than Great Britain. 

The 100 kilometer wide kind at the cutoff of category 3 and 4 would have a thousand times the mass and thus a thousand times the area, which would be about two Earth’s worth, including the oceans and ice caps, and there are hundreds of these and many thousands of the smaller kind. 

Lot’s of room to grow, but how big should you start? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bigger is better when it comes to founding a colony, the more the better because it allows more specialization and self-sufficiency. 

For instance if I want to have a court, any kind of court, I need at least 3 lawyers in my colony, a judge and an advocate for both sides. 

Realistically I need 4 to handle conflicts of interest and to give a defendant at least some choice in who defends them. 

That would mean 4% of your population would be &nbsp;lawyers, in a colony of 100 people. 

The norm is more like a tenth of that, and that would mean a population of a thousand people to support 4 of them at the normal distribution. 

Now you don’t necessarily need courts on a colony and it doesn’t necessarily have to be their full time job, but that won’t be the only profession like that. 

There are a lot specialist areas you can do without, like an insurance salesman, because you could source that from home, ditto a neurologist is better in person but he could do a decent job remotely by analyzing scans and diagnoses taken by a general practitioner on site. 

There are a lot of other things you do need on site though, things that also take a ton of training time, like a veterinarian or nurse or surgeon or dentist. 

Also, after the initial colonies you have a recruitment problem. 

When you have something as prestigious as one of the first colonies and when you have tens of thousands of possible candidates for each specialty, you can find yourself a person with three or four of the necessary specializations and who doesn’t mind doing one that is kind of grubby. 

I have difficulty seeing a colony of less than a hundred people, and I think a thousand is a lot more reasonable for anything that doesn’t allow near real time communication with Earth. 

When we talk about extrasolar colonies though, I’d be thinking more like tens of thousands, because while you can bring all the knowledge of earth with you on data storage, that doesn’t equate to expertise and there’s nobody to call on for help. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though for all these cases you need to consider the impact of things like transhumans. 

People who have had their intelligence amped up can learn faster, people who live a lot longer than now can absorb more specialties, and it implies access to a lot automation that let’s you save your people for mostly mental work, some or all of which might be doable by an artificial intelligence too. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talking about lawyers and courts bring up the idea of how you administrate your colony. 

We will save the case of total independence for episode 3 since, barring us figuring out how to cheat the speed of light, those have to operate totally independently from day 1. 

I’m also not interested in discussing the notion of rebellion and secession, we already have tons of examples of that in history and each occasion tends to be somewhat unique. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I generally tend to assume most colonies in the solar system will be under some existing nation, even if it is nearly autonomous and basically just has a deal cut with some nation to represent their interests at home. 

Like some minor but stable nation back on Earth agrees to act as the intermediary where diplomacy is concerned in exchange for you landing your goods at their spacedock. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interests back home are worth remembering too. 

Not all of a colony is going to be actually at the colony. 

Some might follow along later as the infrastructure allows more to come, or just support the idea enthusiastically but not want to go themselves. 

I remember in one of David Weber’s books it is mentioned that the colony that founded the protagonist's home system of Manticore had intentionally left funds behind on Earth in an administered trust fund building up compound interest so they had resources back on Earth to buy new technologies or pay for colonists passage fees. 

The author remarked there that it was something few other colonies had thought to do but I took that as a bit of poke at a lot of other science fiction where such an obvious good idea never gets mentioned and presumably wasn’t thought of. 

Of course a colony would have a law firm back on Earth watching their interests. 

Of course they would have a lot of consulting groups they could call on to serve as the crisis team when things go wrong like NASA mission control does now. 

The fusion reactor broke, the spare component has been used, you are a year from the nearest place that can send you one. 

It’s handy have some folks back on Earth who can take an inventory of everything you’ve got and MacGyver up a functional spare. 

Even if you are a colony that is specifically looking to get away from Earth cultures, and somehow brought everyone with you, rather than just an initial team funded and supplied by a larger group back home, there’d probably be plenty of firms that would become specialists in the necessary issues colonies tended to face. 

As to what government people would use, we just don’t know. 

Frankly I consider it kind of absurd to ask that anyway for two reasons. 

First, I doubt everyone would use the same kind, and second, I’m strongly of the opinion that whatever kind they use is their decision at that time. 

Which means it will change as the colony ages too. 

It’s a very popular topic when colonization comes up, and we will talk about it a bit more in episode 3, but in my experience if you ask ten people every one will give a different answer and half of them will be completely convinced almost every colony will use one specific approach to self-governance which just happens to correspond to their ownidea of Utopia. 

Their confidence in this will not be one bit shaken by everyone disagreeing with them or noticing that a few of the other folks are just as confident with their own entirely different vision of how things can and indeed must be. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is day-to-day life on the colony like? 

The simple answers are we don’t know, because it would depend way too much on the colony’s purpose, the reason it was founded, and the technologies available. 

What we’ve been doing today is trying to set the background for people to consider this themselves. 

The other simple answer is probably a lot like now in many ways. 

I mean my day-to-day life is almost certainly very different from yours and every other person on this channel. 

We have our work, our family and friends, and our hobbies. 

We juggle them to get them done the best we can and it often involves unpleasant parts even if we mostly enjoy it. 

Now we have a bit of a better picture about what those colonies are going to be like in order to consider that idea, but in the end, much like now, we can only take that so far because it is too broad a concept that is going to vary too much. 

Life for a mining engineer on Ganymede just won’t be much like the life of a doctor on an orbital farm near Earth or his like that of a surgeon who serves at a hub for a lot of smaller colonies. 

We will look a bit more into day-to-day tasks in the next two episodes now that we’ve got more of the basics in place. 

Speaking of that, in next week’s episode we will be looking both at interstellar colony ships, often called generation ships and ark ships, as well as interplanetary colony ships. 

Frequently you will actually use your ship directly as your first colonial structure so it is worth examining. 

We will also talk about some of the crew concepts, daily chores, and also how we might select candidates for colonies during recruitment. 

In the third episode we will cover a number of the topics we had to bypass today but our big focus will be on that first interstellar colony, and in many ways it will more closely resemble early interplanetary colonies. 

We sort of skipped those today to look at what colonies will be like when it’s not a brand new and prestigious thing, because I wanted to save it for the more pioneering tone of an early extrasolar colony.

Space Warfare
---
  
2016-11-24  
https://youtu.be/xvs_f5MwT04  

---

One of the most disappointing moments in my life was when I realized that as cool as they look, giant robots just are not practical war engines. 

Our topic for today is Space Warfare, and was selected by a poll over on the channel’s facebook group. 

This makes for a tricky topic for a couple of reasons. 

First, we have never had a military conflict in space, so it is hard to speak of it in anyway but theoretical. 

Second, tactics change constantly in warfare, and are hugely dependent on what the technology of the time is. 

We don’t know what the available technologies will be, and they ought to change over time too. 

So with all those uncertainties I cannot realistically come into today’s episode saying this is how war will be fought in the future in space. 

But we can look at a lot of common concepts. 

We also have to look at them briefly, since this is the fifth iteration of this script and every version had different topics and none of those four came in at less than thirty minutes. 

So I’m electing to a fast approach to touch on topics rather than going into deep detail. 

We can always come back and look at some of them in greater depth down the road. 

Categories are inevitably arbitrary but here are the ones for today. 

1) Stealth 2) Range 3) Weapons 4) Defenses You probably noticed I didn’t include a section on whether or not we would ever have wars in space or on the morality of war. 

We do sometimes cover ethical concepts on the channel but my goal in doing so is only ever to set the stage for folks to ponder it on their own and draw their own conclusions. 

So I reserve it for when we are in an alien landscape exploring some technology or concept that is not familiar to most, in which case it is handy to lay out a lot of the basic concepts and concerns others have raised on the topic to get the wheels turning. 

The ethical arguments involving war are hardly unfamiliar and in spite of spending about half of my adult life in the military and a good portion of that in frontline combat units I can’t say it granted me any special new insights. 

Since I don’t have any, and since everyone is already familiar with the topic, it would seem quite silly to spend what little time we have today on that. 

That’s not entirely true, I do have some special insights. 

For instance there are a lot of rules to warfare but for some reason they are almost always Rule #1. 

There’s a lot of rule #1’s. 

I decided to start with stealth to get it out of the way. 

This one is simple, there is no stealth in space. 

I will attach an article from our friends at Project Rho that goes into the nuts and bolts of that but this discussion is so well-worn over with nobody every coming up with a way that doesn’t violate known laws of physics that there’s actually a law on it, Nicoll’s Law, and a couple corollaries. 

We will still do the basic walkthrough though. 

First and most obviously, we never know what weird new tech someone might make or when someone might find some new physics, but for this episode we are keeping it to the realm of known science. 

I’m not going to say stealth in space is impossible, but I have never heard of a workable scheme and don’t know anyone who has. 

Everybody wants to have stealth because it’s very handy, I mean that is rule #1 of combat, don’t let the enemy see you. 

Stealth is without doubt the most valuable thing in war. 

So people want stealth but there are some reasons why this isn’t viable. 

First we have the engines themselves, and putting it kind of bluntly a spaceship’s rockets are about as covert and subtle as pack of clowns parading around with drums and megaphones in a town plaza during the day. 

They are literally the least unnoticeable thing there is. 

They are giant explosions. 

The sorts of engines we use right now to get stuff into space could be detected by the sorts of equipment we have right now all the way out on the fringe of the solar system. 

The kinds you’d need to move the big ships we often see in scifi might be detectable at interstellar distance, and that’s assuming people haven’t gotten better detectors. 

Which they would, since we know how to build much bigger and better telescopes than we have now we just don’t because hauling them up into space where they’d work best is too expensive. 

The cleverest way I’ve ever heard for trying to conceal that would be to have all your exhaust coming out as neutrinos, and in tight beams you could aim off at an angle behind you in the direction of nothing. 

How you would do that was not explained but even then one tend to assume if you can make all your thrust neutrinos and tightly beamed like that then people have probably also gotten much better at detecting them too so I doubt that would help much. 

But it wouldn’t make much difference anyway, because we still have three other ways to pick up a ship. 

The second is the light it blocks. 

If something passes between a star and you, it blocks that light, and there are a lot more stars than we can see with our naked eye. 

They also can’t just mimic the light they are blocking since that won’t be the same for two different observers. 

If you just happen to know where everyone is who can see you could emit a laser at each that replicated what they were supposed to see but that’s hardly full proof and wouldn’t work if you didn’t know where all the monitors were for instance. 

If you could get around that you would still have the third problem, which is that you are giving off infrared heat. 

Everything you do on your ship warms it up and that heat can only escape by radiating away. 

We can pick up radio signals out in the outer solar system light-hours away that are only 10 or 20 watts, your body is giving off more than that right now in infrared. 

Now you could maybe run cold, drifting in with all your crew on ice or no crew at all, just a computer doing minimal tasks. 

Heck maybe just one big chunk of metal moving at relativistic velocities, a relativistic kill missile or RKM which we’ll talk about more later, but basically a big bullet. 

The problem is space is not a true vacuum, even interstellar space tends to have about a million hydrogen atoms per cubic meter, and your missile is moving at hundreds of millions of meters a second. 

Even a missile only about a meter wide is going to slam into around a quadrillion hydrogen atoms a second and be emitting hundreds of kilowatts of radiation from that. 

So your sleek and stealthy missile is only as loud as a radio transmitter for a major metropolitan network. 

The faster it goes, or the bigger it is, the brighter it is. 

Plus it will still block starlight. 

So again, stealth is not really an option in space without some new physics-breaking technology. 

Now that doesn’t mean you can’t use other types of stealth, like pretending to be something else or having someone sabotage your enemy’s sensor network, but that’s a different story. 

Also there is still going to be a maximum range that anyone can detect a certain thing, maybe you can see a big starship’s engines around another star but that doesn’t mean you could detect a cold-running sleek and stealthy missile that far off. 

And range, our next topic, is a weird one. 

We will often here people talk about the maximum range of a weapon for instance and that can get confusing. 

For instance most pistols are no good out past a hundred meters but what we mean by that is what distance a decent marksman using normal ammo can hit a human sized target at without lots of special conditions aiding or hindering him. 

You can obviously hit the broadside of a barn a lot further out because bullets don’t magically fall out of the sky after a hundred meters, they can easily travel kilometers before landing and while all sorts of things about the gun, the ammo, or the air can alter its expected trajectory a bit they generally stay pretty on course. 

There’s no air in space and one assumes we will get increasing precise with our weaponry so that’s not the source of maximum ranges in space. 

People often get irritated by energy weapons like lasers having some listed maximum range because a laser should keep going forever, which is not actually true but for practical purposes more or less is because they do have a maximum range from something else. 

Space is big, really, really, really big. 

So even though light moves really, really quick it still means it can take quite a while for the light from your target to reach you and your laser to reach them. 

They’re no longer going to be in the same place since they are presumably moving. 

Now that’s not a problem in and of itself, if you know how fast someone is going and in what direction you can aim for where they will be when your shot arrives. 

But if they’ve got fuel to spare they can be accelerating, and while no one ever shows it in science fiction, even though those ships always seem to have infinite fuel, the first and most obvious defensive maneuver any ship’s captain would learn would be to have his ship constantly flicking around in random directions. 

Just a little side thrust for a minute one way and then another picked at random. 

So if your target is one light minute away it will take a minute for light to reach you and a minute for you to send back and that means that ship has two minutes to accelerate. 

If it did at just one gee it could be anywhere inside a 70 kilometer radius sphere centered on where you expected it to be. 

If it were 2-gees it would be 140 kilometers. 

If it were twice the distance, and one-gee, it would be 280 kilometers. 

Of course if the ship were 70 kilometers wide itself it wouldn’t matter, you could aim for its middle and still hit. 

Though I wouldn’t suggest shooting at something that big since taking potshots at a warship the size of country is probably picking a fight you don’t want. 

That’s Rule #1 of combat, never pick a fight with anyone bigger than you. 

Actually, even fair fights are a bad idea, so you are best off always picking on someone smaller than you and it’s still a good idea to cheat anyway you can. 

Always having an advantage in firepower is without doubt the most valuable thing in war. 

So the bigger a target is and the slower it can accelerate the further away you can hit it with lasers. 

Don’t assume big means slow though, a ship twice as massive needs twice the fuel to accelerate with but it does have twice the room for fuel. 

It probably has more too since it can get away with not doubling everything else, you don’t necessarily need a second coffeemaker on a ship just because you doubled your mass, even if you doubled your crew, which you probably wouldn’t need to. 

Obviously you need at least one coffeemaker since no sane military commander would ever go to war without a ready supply of coffee. 

But the key point is big doesn’t mean slow, and again quite possibly the reverse. 

It will still have a larger effective range you can hit it at though because the range is always based on how fast the ship is and how big it is. 

For instance some robot drone the size of baseball only needs to move maybe ten centimeters to seriously decrease you odds of hitting it, meaning it is hard to hit even a light second away even if it can only do one-gee, and it might be able to pull off a thousand gees. 

This does not mean smaller is always better though, and we’ll look at the more later on. 

Other weapons have different sorts of maximum ranges, for instance a missile can have a guidance system that will guarantee it hits, so long as it doesn’t get shot down or run out of fuel. 

Running out of fuel is not really about distance in space though, it’s about being able to catch up to whatever you are trying to hit and still having some fuel to change directions to intercept it if it is dodging and to avoid being shot down. 

A ship could run right by you and you might still be unable to hit it with your missiles if it is trucking along at tenth of light speed and your missiles don’t have the fuel to get to that speed themselves. 

That’s even more true if you were moving the opposite direction when you fired them and now they need to make up another tenth of light speed just to get back to where you fired them. 

So range is pretty variable concept in space warfare and depends on the target’s characteristics as much as the weapons themselves. 

Moving on to weapons we’ve got tons, even without going into some of the cooler but less scientifically realistic ones, and I’ll still through some of those too. 

We’ve got lasers, we’ve got masers and grasers, we’ve got rail guns and nukes and missiles and kinetic weapons and anti-matter and particle beams and even exotic particle beams and black holes. 

But more importantly we have some specific classifications of weapons, smart vs dumb, light speed vs slower than light, and ones which can circumvent intervening space. 

Now in this context a normal gun would be classified as sub-light and dumb. 

It doesn’t circumvent space either because it does need to pass through it and anything in it. 

Alternatively a classic scifi teleporter could presumably teleport a bomb right to a location. 

Here I’m using ‘circumvent space’ to mean both something that could just leap from point A to point B that way or which does not have to worry about being weakened or disrupted by things in the way, sort of like an armor-piercing round can go through armor. 

I should note on things we’d think of as guns that the barrel of a gun in space doesn’t serve the same purpose in a vacuum as in air. 

Rifling in barrels primarily exists to let the bullet spin and stabilize its flight through air, though it also helps avoid the issue muskets had of the ball not fitting the barrel to give a good seal. 

Long barrels on space weapons just serve to give the projectile more room to accelerate. 

I mention this because when we think of space warfare we tend to assume everything being shot that isn’t energy is a smart weapon. 

We can make computers mighty small and sticking a small guidance package into every bullet would seem a good idea. 

The problem is that while we can make circuits that can withstand accelerations that would turn you or I into chunky salsa, they still can’t handle the same amount of acceleration one solid chunk of iron or uranium could. 

So you should always be able to produce dumb rounds that can come out faster than smart ones and that should hold into the future too, even if we can make smart weapons able to handle a lot more gee force. 

That means you can have a much shorter barrel with a much faster reaction time too. 

It’s not something we normally have to think about at the scale and speed we do war at nowadays but if I want to shoot a gun at something I have to turn the barrel to point at where I want to aim. 

A long barrel is going to tear itself apart if you turn it too fast, and any lag-time caused by the weapon cycling up and shooting is going to add to that distance your target can dodge by accelerating. 

That said, and that’s mostly a concern for point-defense which will talk about in the next section, by and large you want smart weapons wherever you can have them. 

You can’t make a laser smart though and it is your fastest weapon. 

We also tend to assume every projectile is going to have a warhead in it but it depends on what sorts of speeds we’re talking about. 

Very fast weapons don’t benefit from having chemical explosives in them, their collision energy is already way higher than an equal weight of explosives would have. 

Relativistic projectiles, things moving at a decent fraction of the speed of light, don’t benefit from even a nuclear warhead aboard. 

They are already carrying around energy comparable to anti-matter. 

If you’re not familiar with the kinds of yields anti-matter has, a normal bullet that included a little bit of anti-matter inside it would explode like a nuke. 

Amusingly meaning that you could make a pistol or rifle that fired a nuke with every trigger pull but you’d be inside the blast radius, so much smaller bullets with much smaller amounts of antimatter in them would be smarter. 

Normal bullets for firearms tend to weigh a few grams, one gram of antimatter, combining with an equal amount of normal matter, is a few time more potent than the original atom bombs used at the close of the Second World War, while a billionth of a gram is more on par with a modern hand grenade. 

However, while hitting a nuke with a hammer or bullet will just damage it, not cause it to explode, antimatter is the exact opposite, it doesn’t require a complex process to make it detonate, it requires a complex one to prevent it, since it explodes the instant it touches normal matter. 

We usually figure on using magnetic bottles to contain anti-matter but those probably cannot handle very high-gee accelerations… your average bullet undergoes thousands of gees for instance, and bouncing off the ground tends to be a lot more than one-gee too. 

So while on the surface anti-matter is both the perfect explosive and the perfect rocket fuel that’s only true if you can not only produce huge amounts of it cheaply but also can store it safely and use it safely. 

If firing it out of rifle or cannon barrel caused the magnetic bottle to fail to contain it, you just blew up your gun, and given the yields involved, not just your gun but everything within several miles. 

That’s Rule #1 of combat, never use a weapon that’s as likely to kill you and allies as it is the enemy. 

That’s why claymore mines have big notes on them reminding you which way to point them and why biowarfare has never been popular with militaries. 

Now a laser is the fastest weapon, which at close range means it never misses either, but at a distance it can miss since it can’t change its course. 

This is also applies to variations on the laser like the maser, which shoots microwaves, or a graser, which is a gamma-ray version. 

Missiles can change course so are better at longer ranges. 

They also are not vulnerable to mirrors. 

No mirror is 100% reflective and they normally only act as a mirror for certain ranges. 

For instance we don’t even have a material that can reflect gamma-rays yet, while the normal mirror for microwaves is chicken wire. 

Hit a mirror with enough juice and it will get destroyed, hit it with a frequency it doesn’t reflect, or doesn’t reflect as well, and it will get destroyed. 

Pepper the enemy with debris to damage those mirrors and they will get detroyed, but they are still a decent defense against lasers. 

So missiles have an advantage there too. 

Now an energy weapon doesn’t have to shoot photons. 

A gravity based laser would go just as fast if you could figure out how to make one, but you don’t need to go at light speed. 

99.9% of Light speed is just about as good and you could have a particle accelerator, a particle beam or particle projector cannon, which would get the job done against a mirror too. 

They are susceptible to a magnetic shield though. 

Key concept here is that a mix of weapons is a good thing even if some get you less bang for your buck. 

Now there’s a lot of scifi weapons we’re skipping because they either are just made up or not based on known science but one I did want to mention that’s at the fringe of possible is a meson beam. 

Neutral pions, a type of meson, interact with normal matter about as weakly as neutrinos, which as you’ve probably heard could slide through a light-year thick sheet of lead uninterrupted. 

Neutrinos don’t make a good weapon for that reason, a neutrino beam would just go right through someone’s armor but they’d also go through the person or ship too. 

But neutral pions decay, quite quickly too, they’re the shortest lived pion and live for about a 10 millionth of a nanosecond. 

Which means normally they die before they even get outside of the atom they originated from, but we can detect them by slowing down time when we make them, by making them go very, very fast. 

Now with a big enough accelerator you should be able to speed the mesons up so much that they can cover real world distance before decaying, and the normally decay into gamma rays, so you can bypass people’s armor with something like that. 

Now a particle’s half life is not an accurate timer where beams are concerned, even if they form the basis of the very accurate atomic clocks. 

Not all those meson will decay at just the moment they pass through the target and the further away you’re shooting the less likely it is a given meson would decay inside the target, but if you are at close ranges or you can make them at close ranges, or you’ve got a target that is just impenetrably armored it is a potential weapon that can circumvent armor, akin to teleporting a bomb inside an enemy ship or opening up a wormhole inside a bunker. 

Wormholes, should we ever be able to get them to work, are obviously excellent weapons too. 

Also a good reminder to scifi authors, a lot of super-technology made for book or movie or TV ends up breaking suspension of disbelief when people start realizing what other purposes it can be put too, and just about anything can be weaponized. 

Micro Black Holes are another type of circumventing weapon and one we discussed before. 

Black holes have a lifetime, according to Hawking, and the lighter they are the shorter they live. 

Ones weighing only about a ton would only live a few nanoseconds for instance but would be a lot smaller than a proton and would fly right through basically anything, then die, releasing energies that would make the biggest nuke we’ve ever made look like a firecracker. 

You can time these a lot better, by controlling mass and speed you shoot it at, and it’s not something you can really stop because it is so tiny but has so much inertia. 

They’re not really black though, they’ll be bleeding off huge amounts of radiation on the way there, so you might be able to knock one of course with a very powerful and very narrow laser. 

I’d laugh at that except that you basically need those kind of lasers to make these sorts of black holes, kugelblitz black holes, in the first place. 

So if your enemy has the tech to make them you have the tech to deflect one, but it would still be a nigh impossible target to hit in order to do that, and it will go right through any type of armor, though of course it can still miss and it can still be dodged. 

As we move into Defense we can see another obvious rule #1, the best defense is not getting hit, so distance is your best defense. 

Of course it is also hard to beat your enemy if you stay far away, so that’s not always an option. 

If you have to get into a slugging match it does pay to have armor and this is a case where size does matter. 

Let’s say I have armor that’s a meter thick on a ship and uses up 10% of its total mass. 

Now I clone that ship only twice as big, in each direction. 

According to the Square-Cube law I should have 8 times more volume and mass, but only 4 times as much surface area. 

So meter thick armor on it now only uses up 5% of the ship’s mass, not 10%. 

Maybe I use that 5% for more engines and fuel, maybe I just use it for more armor, and again I probably get a bit more than 5% since some of my systems didn’t need to go up proportionally with the mass. 

As mentioned earlier, I don’t necessarily need eight times the crew or coffee pots just because my ship is eight times heavier. 

We also have point-defense. 

While you can use reflective hulls to handle laser attacks, and magnetic fields around you to help against solar radiation and particle beams, they won’t do much against missiles and bullets and big explosions. 

Armor helps with that too but ideally you blow stuff up before it gets to you, and the sooner you hit it the less damage you take as it will spread out in a cone, the wider the better. 

A quick note there, we think of explosives as going off in a sphere but in practice, if the exploding thing is moving fast, it is going to be shaped as a cone as all the material keeps moving forward even as it explodes in a sphere in its own rest frame. 

That means anything you blow up is still going to go off like a shotgun blast so you want to let it have as much room to widen out as possible so most of it isn’t hitting your ship or at least is spreading all over your armor, not at just one point. 

Now a laser is a great point-defense weapon since it can’t miss at ranges you need to worry about shrapnel, though there’s a lot to be said about high-speed equivalents to flak cannons or just just having a ton of small debris near you. 

A nuke is a pretty good way to deal with volleys too. 

Always a thing to keep in mind, if you’ve got a point defense system that can reliably shoot down a missile a second, your enemy isn’t going to politely feed you one every second, they are going to send ten in at the same time every ten seconds instead. 

Lasers aren’t necessarily ideal for that scenario. 

You might have relativistic slugs coming at you that have some maneuverability and you can’t target them till they’re a thousand kilometers out, that is not a lot of time and they are going to need a big powerful hit to shred them up enough to spread out so their shrapnel doesn’t tear you apart. 

I usually laugh when people refer to nukes as a defensive weapon, they are in a diplomatic sense but not when the fighting starts, but in this case they can be, you know you can’t target the volley of inbound objects fast enough with lasers so when you first pick them up you fire a nuke toward them and intercept them further out with a device where precision strikes don’t much matter. 

Of course it would be nice to have the classic scifi shield or forcefield, but we don’t have any paths to that in known science, just magnetic fields and the like. 

But we do have the option of an even more classic shield. 

The old school big sheet of metal on an arm. 

Such a shield can be thicker than your normal armor because it doesn’t have to be all over, you move it to interpose with the enemy. 

It’s also out at a distance so when it starts getting shredded the stuff that get through is still going be getting deflected and scattered and you’ve got some distance for it to scatter. 

This is space after all, your shield doesn’t have to be right next to your ship, your arm could be hundreds of kilometers long. 

You can also use that to maneuver with, as a way of saving fuel for bouncing around in random directions, since you can just tilt and whirl with the thing, or things. 

That still takes energy but less of it and it could be mostly recovered, as with a spring, and it’s not costing you any reaction mass or leaving huge jets of flame when you move. 

As I mentioned at the beginning there’s a lot of stuff we bypassed today, there’s never enough time, but I think we’ve covered the key concepts important to considering this topic which is always our goal here, to setup people up to know what the right question to ask are and where to go to find out more. 

Our friends at Project Rho are a great source for more on spaceships, including spaceship fights. 

For those of you more interested in looking at infantry or ground combat aspects I’ll also recommend MilSF.com, operated by my friend, Author Bill Frisbee, he has a tons of articles discussing a ton of topics on that subject. 

I’ll link both in the episode description and while they are amazing resources for sci-fi authors they are also a lot of fun to read if you just like the sort of in-depth approach we do on this channel. 

Next week we will be beginning a short series of related videos on colonization. 

As mentioned today’s topic was picked by the Facebook group and the close second was to take a look at Early Colonization of other Solar Systems. 

Sort of as an extension on last week’s fun collaboration on Colonizing our own Solar system with Frasier Cain of Universe Today. 

When I was thinking about it though I realized that while we often talk about the more technological and mechanical aspect of things like spaceships or asteroid mining or planet bases we never spend much time on what life on those would actually be like. 

We never talk about day to day life on them, we never talk about how you would govern one, we never talk about what life on a colony ship would be like, and I think we can and should try to give that a look because it’s a common conversation when people discuss these topics and there are a lot of misconceptions I think we can address. 

It’s also a long topic so we will break it up into three phases to set the stage, looking at life on a remote colony in our own solar system, then life on a colony ship, then our early extrasolar colony. 

Make sure to subscribe for alerts when those episodes come out, and if you want to discuss this topic more or get to suggest topics and vote in the polls we pick them from, make sure to come on over and join the facebook group, Science &amp; Futurism with Isaac Arthur. 

And if you enjoyed this episode, make sure to like it and share it with others. 

Until next time, thanks for watching, and have a great day!

Colonizing the Solar System, part 2: the Outer Solar System

2016-11-17  
https://youtu.be/0W7IRBeDkj4

Okay, so today’s episode is Colonizing the Outer Solar System, and is actually part 2 of our team up with Fraser Cain of Universe Today, who looked at the inner solar system. 

If you are regular here you might want jump over there now and watch that part first, if you are coming in from having seen part 1, welcome, it is great having you here, and as a heads up I do have a bit of speech impediment so you should probably turn on the closed captions. 

Without further ado let us get started. First off, there is no official demarcation between the inner and outer solar system but for today we will be beginning the outer solar system at the Asteroid Belt. The Asteroid Belt is always of interest to us for colonization. We have talked about mining them before if you want the details on that but for today I’ll just remind everyone that they’re are very rich in metals, including precious metals like gold and platinum, and that provides all the motivation we need to colonize them. We have a lot of places to cover so we won’t repeat the details on that today. You cannot terraform asteroids the way you could Venus or Mars so that you could walk around on them like Earth, but in every other respect they have a lot going for them as a candidate. They’ve got plenty of rock and metal for construction, they have lots of the basic organic elements, and they even have some water. They also get a decent amount of sunlight, less than Mars let alone Earth, but still enough for use as a power source and to grow plants. 

But they don’t have much gravity, which - pardon the pun - has its ups and downs. 

There just isn’t much mass in the Belt. The entire thing has only a small fraction of the mass of our moon, and over half of that is in the four biggest asteroids, essentially dwarf planets in their own right. The remainder is scattered over millions of asteroids. Even the biggest, Ceres, is only about 1% of 1% of Earth’s mass, has a surface gravity of 3% Earth-normal, and an escape velocity low enough most model rockets could get into orbit. 

And again, it is the biggest, most you could get away from by jumping hard and if you dropped an object on one it might take a few minutes to land. 

You can still terraform one though, by definition too. The gentleman who coined the term, science fiction author Jack Williamson, who also coined the term genetic engineering, used it for a smaller asteroid just a few kilometers across, so any definition of terraforming has to include tiny asteroids as well. Of course in that story it’s like a small planet because they had artificial gravity, we don’t, if we want to fake gravity without having mass we need to spin stuff around. So if we want to terraform an asteroid we need to hollow it out and fill it with air and spin it around. 

Of course you do not actually hollow out the asteroid and spin it, asteroids are loose balls of gravel and most would fly apart given any noticeable spin. Instead you would hollow it out and set a cylinder spinning inside it. Sort of like how a good thermos has an outside container and inside one with a layer of vacuum in between, we would spin the inner cylinder. You wouldn’t have to work hard to hollow out an asteroid either, most aren’t big enough to have sufficient gravity and pressure to crush an empty beer can even at their center. So you can pull matter out from them very easily and shore up the sides with very thin metal walls or even ice. Or just have your cylinder set inside a second non-spinning outer skin or superstructure, like your washer or dryer has. You can then conduct your mining from the inside, shielded from space. You could even pressurize that hollowed out area if your spinning living area was inside its own superstructure. No gravity, but warmth and air, and you could get away with just a little spin without tearing it apart, maybe enough for plants to grow to normally. Zero gravity experiments with plants have shown them to grow just fine without gravity but it probably helps to have a little to make sure water falls down and trees grow up. You could probably get some monstrously tall trees in low-gravity too. 

Moving on to Jupiter, it should be noted that you can potentially colonize even the gas giants themselves, even though our focus today is mostly on their moons. That requires a lot more effort and technology then the sorts of colonies we are discussing today. Fraser and I decided to keep things near-future and fairly low tech, though he actually did an article on colonizing Jupiter itself last year that was my main source material back before we got to talking and decided to do a video together, so I will include that in the episode description if you are interested. Hydrogen is plentiful on Jupiter itself and floating refineries or ships that fly down to scoop it up might be quite useful, but again today we are more interested in its moons. The biggest problem with colonizing the moons of Jupiter is all the radiation the planet gives off. 

Gas giants tend to have immense magnetospheres, which is normally a great thing for shielding you from radiation, unfortunately it also traps charged particles. Earth has the van Allen Belt as a result, which is not a healthy place to hang out. Jupiter’s equivalent of this is far bigger and deadlier and includes many of its moons. 

Which means that even though three of Jupiter’s moons are bigger than our moon, and the biggest, Ganymede, is bigger than both Pluto and Mercury, our interest falls to the fourth biggest one, Europa, that has a nice thick layer of protective ice we can easily use for radiation shielding. 

Which isn’t to say the others don’t interest us too, but they are much more like colonizing our own moon, just plus tons of radiation, or in Io’s case, non-stop volcanoes and earthquakes. 

Europa is best known as a place where the surface is covered with ice but beneath it is thought to be a vast subsurface ocean. It is the sixth largest moon in the solar system, coming right behind our own at number five and is one of the original four moons Galileo discovered back in 1610, almost two centuries before we even discovered Uranus, so it has always been a source of interest. However as we have discovered more planets and moons we have come to believe quite a few of them might also have subsurface oceans too. Now what is neat about them is that water, liquid water, always leaves the door open to the possibility of life already existing there. We still know so little about how life originally evolved and what conditions permit that to occur that we cannot rule out places like Europa already having their own plants and animals swimming around under that ice. They probably do not and obviously we wouldn’t want to colonize them, beyond research bases, if they did, but if they do not they become excellent places to colonize. You could have submarine cities in such places floating around in the sea or those buried in the surface ice layer, well shielded from radiation and debris. The water also geysers up to the surface in some places so you can start off near those, you don’t have to drill down through kilometers of ice on day one. 

Water, and hydrogen, are also quite uncommon in the inner solar system so having access to a place like Europa where the escape velocity is only about a fifth of our own is quite handy for export. Now as we move on to talk about moons a lot it is important to note that when I say something has a fifth of the escape velocity of Earth that doesn’t mean it is fives time easier to get off of it. Energy rises with the square of velocity so if you need to go five times faster you need to spend 5-squared or 25 times more energy, and even more if that place has tons of air creating friction and drag, atmospheres are hard to claw your way up through though they make landing easier too. But even ignoring air friction you can move 25 liters of water off of Europa for every liter you could export from Earth and even it has a very high in gravity compared to most moons and comets. 

Plus we probably don’t want to export lots of water, or anything else, off of Earth anyway. 

Jupiter also has the Trojan Asteroids, the Asteroid Belt is not the only place you find asteroids, Jupiter’s Trojan Asteroids are nearly as numerous, and every planet, including Earth, has an equivalent to Jupiter’s Trojan Asteroids at its own Lagrange Points with the Sun. Though just as Jupiter dwarfs all the other planets so to does its collection of Lagrangian objects. They can be quite big too, the largest 624 Hektor, is 400 km across, and has a size and shape similar to Pennsylvania. And as these asteroids are at stable Lagrange Points, they orbit with Jupiter but always ahead and behind it, making transit to and from Jupiter much easier and making them good waypoints. 

Before we go out any further in the solar system we should probably address how you get the energy to stay alive. Mars is already quite cold compared to Earth, and the Asteroids and Jupiter even more so, but with thick insulation and some mirrors to bounce light in you can do fairly decently. Indeed, sunlight out by Jupiter is already down to just 4% of what Earth gets, meaning at Jovian distances it is about 50 W/m² That might not sound like much but it is actually almost a third of what average illumination is on Earth, when you factor in atmospheric reflection, cloudy days, nighttime, and higher, colder latitudes. It is also a good deal brighter than the inside of most well-lit buildings, and is enough for decently robust photosynthesis to grow food. Especially with supplemental light from mirrors or LED growth lamps. But once you get out to Saturn and further that becomes increasingly impractical and a serious issue, because while food growth does not show up on your electric bill it is what we use virtually all our energy for. 

Closer in to the sun we can use solar panels for power and we do not need any power to grow food. As we get further out we cannot use solar and we need to heat our cold habitats and supply lighting for food, so we need a lot more power even as our main source dries up. So what are our options? Well the first is simple, build bigger mirrors. A mirror can be quite large and paper thin after all. Alternatively we can build those mirrors far away, closer to the sun, and either focus them on the place we want illuminated or send an energy beam, microwaves perhaps or lasers, out to the destination to supply energy. We also have the option of using fission, if we can find enough Uranium or Thorium. There is not a lot of either in the solar system, in the area of about one part per billion, but that does amount to hundreds of trillions of tons, and it should only take a few thousand tons a year to supply Earth’s entire electric grid. So we would be looking at millions of years’ worth of energy supply. 

Of course fusion is even better, particularly since hydrogen becomes much more abundant as you get further from the Sun. We do not have fusion yet, but it is a technology we can plan around probably having inside our lifetimes, and while uranium and thorium might be counted in parts per billion, hydrogen is more plentiful than every other element combined, especially once you get far from the Sun and Inner Solar System. 

So it is much better power source, an effectively unlimited one except on time scales of billions and trillion of years. Still, if we do not have it, we have other options. Bigger mirrors, beaming energy outwards from closer to the Sun, and classic fission of Uranium and Thorium. 

Access to fusion is not absolutely necessary but if you have it you can unlock the outer solar system because you have your energy supply, a cheap and abundant fuel supply, and much faster and cheaper spaceships. Of course hydrogen, plain old vanilla hydrogen with one proton, like the sun uses for fusion, is harder to fuse than deuterium and may be a lot longer developing, we also have fusion using Helium-3 which has some advantages over hydrogen, so that is worth keeping in mind as well as we proceed outward. 

Okay, let’s move on to Saturn, and again our focus is on its moons more than the planet itself. The biggest of those and the most interesting for colonization is Titan. 

Titan is aptly named, this titanic moon contains more mass than all of Saturn’s sixty or so other moons combined and by an entire order of magnitude at that. It is massive enough to hold an atmosphere, and one where the surface pressure is 45% higher than here on Earth. 

Even though Titan is much smaller than Earth, its atmosphere is about 20% more massive than our own. It’s almost all nitrogen too, even more than our own atmosphere, so while you would need a breather mask to supply oxygen and it is also super-cold, so you’d need a thick insulated suit, it doesn’t have to be a pressure suit like it would on Mars or almost anyplace else. There’s no oxygen in the atmosphere, what little isn’t nitrogen is mostly methane and hydrogen, but there is plenty of oxygen in the ice on Titan which is quite abundant. So it has everything we need for life except energy and gravity. At 14% of earth normal it is probably too low for people to comfortably and safely adapt to, but we’ve already discussed ways of dealing with that. It is low enough that you could probably flap your arms and fly, if you had wings attached. 

It needs some source of energy though, and we just discussed that. Obviously if you’ve got fusion you have all the hydrogen you need, but Titan is one of those places we would probably want to colonize early on if we could, it has nitrogen which is something you need a lot of to terraform other places, and is also rich in a lot of the others things we want. So we often think of it as a low-tech colony since it is one we would want early on. In any scenario like that it is very easy to imagine a lot of local transit between Titan and its smaller neighboring moons, which are more rocky and might be easier to dig fissile materials like Uranium and Thorium out of. You might have a dozen or so small outposts on neighboring moons mining fissile materials and other metals and a big central hub on Titan they delivered that to which also exported Nitrogen to other colonies in the solar system. 

Moving back and forth between moons is pretty easy, especially since things landing on Titan can aerobrake quite easily, whereas Titan itself has a pretty strong gravity well and thick atmosphere to climb out of but is a good candidate for a space elevator, since it requires nothing more sophisticated than a Lunar Elevator on our own moon and has an abundant supply of the materials needed to make Zylon for instance, a material strong enough to make an elevator there and which we can mass manufacture right now. 

Titan might be the largest and most useful of Saturn’s moons, but again it isn’t the only one and not all of the other are just rocks for mining. At last count it has over sixty and many of them quite large. One of those, Enceladus, Saturn’s sixth largest moon, is a lot like Jupiter’s Moon Europa, in that we believe it has a large and thick subsurface ocean. So just like Europa it is an interesting candidate for Colonization. 

So Titan might be the hub for Saturn but it wouldn’t be the only significant place to colonize. 

While Saturn is best known for its amazing rings, they tend to be overlooked in colonization. 

Now those rings are almost all ice and in total mass about a quarter as much as Enceladus, which again is Saturn’s Sixth largest moon, which is itself not even a thousandth of the Mass of Titan. In spite of that the rings are not a bad place to set up shop. Being mostly water, they are abundant in hydrogen for fusion fuel and have little mass individually, which makes them as easy to approach or leave as an asteroid. 

Just big icebergs in space really, and there are many moonlets in the rings that can be as large as half a kilometer across. So you can burrow down inside one for protection from radiation and impacts and possibly mine smaller ones for their ice to be brought to places where water is not abundant. In total those rings, which are all frozen water, only mass about 2% of Earth’s oceans, and about as much as the entire Antarctic sheet. So it is a lot of fresh water that is very easy to access and move elsewhere, and ice mines in the rings of Saturn might be quite useful and make good homes too. Living inside an iceball might not sound appealing but it is better than it sounds like and we will discuss that more when we reach the Kupier Belt. 

But first we still have two more planets to look at, Uranus and Neptune. 

Uranus, and Neptune, are sometimes known as Ice Giants instead of Gas Giants because they have a lot more water. They also have more ammonia and methane and all three get called ices in this context because they make up most of the solid matter when you get this far out in the solar system. While Jupiter is over a thousand times the mass of Earth, Uranus weighs in at about 15 times the Earth and has only about double the escape velocity of Earth itself, the least of any of the gas giants, and its strange rotation, and its strange tilt contributes to it having much less wind than other giants. 

Additionally the gravity is just a little less than Earth’s in the atmosphere so we have the option for floating habitats again, though it would be a lot more like a submarine than a hot air balloon. Like Venus, Uranus has very long days, at least in terms of places receiving continual sunlight, the poles get 42 years of perpetual sunlight then 42 years of darkness. Sunlight being a relative term, the light is quite minimal especially inside the atmosphere. The low wind in many places makes it a good spot for gas extraction, such as Helium-3, and it's a good planet to try to scoop gas from or even have permanent installations. Now Uranus has a large collection of moons as well, useful and colonizable like the other moons we have looked at, but otherwise unremarkable beyond being named for characters from Shakespeare, rather than the more common mythological names. 

None have atmospheres though there is a possibility Oberon or Titania might have subsurface oceans. 

Neptune makes for a brief entry, it is very similar to Uranus except it has the characteristically high winds of gas giants that Uranus’s skewed poles mitigate, meaning it has no advantages over Uranus and the disadvantages of high wind speeds everywhere and being even further from the Sun. It also has moons and one of them, Triton, is thought to have subsurface oceans as well. Triton also presumably has a good amount of nitrogen inside it since it often erupts geysers of nitrogen from its surface. 

Triton is one of the largest moons in the solar system, coming in seventh just after our Moon, number 5, and Europa at number 6. Meaning that were it not a moon it would probably qualify as a Dwarf Planet and it is often thought Pluto might be an escaped moon of Neptune. So Triton might be one that didn’t escape, or didn’t avoid getting captured. 

We’ve talked before about colonizing icy dwarf planets like Pluto, and there are several essentially identical objects to Pluto in the Solar System, so we won’t do another entry just for Pluto. In fact there are an awful lot of bodies in this general size range and composition wandering about in the outer regions of our solar system as we get out into the Kupier Belt. 

The Kupier Belt is one of those things that has a claim on the somewhat arbitrary and hazy boundary marking the edge of the Solar System. It extends from out past Neptune to beyond Pluto and contains a good deal more mass than the asteroid Belt. It is where a lot of our comets come from and while there is plenty of rocks out there they tend to be covered in ice. In other words it is like our asteroid belt only there’s more of it and the one thing the belt is not very abundant in, water and hydrogen in general, is quite abundant out there. So if you have a power source like fusion they can be easily terraformed and are just as attractive as a source of minerals as the various asteroids and moons closer in. We mentioned the idea of living inside hollowed out asteroids earlier and you can use the same trick for comets. Indeed you could shape them to be much bigger if you like, since they would be hollow and ice isn’t hard to move and shape especially in zero gravity. Same trick as before, you place a spinning cylinder inside it. Not all the object is entirely ice and indeed your average comet is more a frozen ball of mud then ice. And most would have rocky cores. We think a lot of near Earth Asteroids are just leftover comets. So they are probably pretty good homes if you have fusion, lots of fuel and raw materials for both life and construction. 

This is probably your cheapest interstellar spacecraft too, in terms of effort anyway. 

People often talk about re-directing comets to Mars to bring it air and water, but you can just as easily re-direct it out of the solar system entirely. Comets tend to have highly eccentric orbits, so if you capture one when it is near the Sun you can accelerate it then, actually benefiting from the Oberth Effect, and drive it out of the solar system into deep space. If you have a fusion power source to live inside one then you also have an interstellar spaceship drive, so you just carve yourself a small colony inside the comet and head out into deep space. You’ve got supplies that will last you many centuries at least, even if it were home to tens of thousand of people, and while we think of smaller asteroids and comets as tiny, that’s just in comparison to planets. These things tend to be the size of mountain so there is plenty of living space and a kilometer of dirty ice between you and space makes a great shield against even the kinds of radiation and collisions you can experience at relativistic speeds. 

Now the Oort Cloud is much like the Kupier Belt but begins even further out and extends out probably an entire light year or more. We don’t have a firm idea of its exact dimensions or mass, but the current notion is that it has at least several Earth’s worth of mass, mostly in various icy bodies. These will be quite numerous, estimates usually assumes at least trillion icy bodies a kilometer across or bigger, and even more smaller ones. However the volume of space is so large that those kilometer wide bodies might each be around a billion kilometers distant from neighbors, or about a light hour. So it is spread out quite thinly, and even the inner edge is about 10 light days away. 

That means that from a practical standpoint there is no source of power out there, the sun is simply too diffuse for even massive collections of mirrors and solar panels to be of use. It also means light-speed messages home or to neighbors are quite delayed. So in terms of communication it is a lot more like pre-modern times in sparsely settled lands where talking with your nearest neighbors might require an hour long walk over to their farm, and any news from the big cities might take months to percolate out to you. 

There’s probably uranium and thorium out there to be found, maybe a decent amount of it too, so fission as a power source is not ruled out. If you have fusion instead though each of these kilometer wide icy bodies is like a giant tank of gasoline, and as with the Kupier Belt, ice makes a nice shield against impacts and radiation. 

And while there might be trillions of kilometer wide chunks of ice out there, and many more smaller bodies, you would have quite a few larger ones too. There are almost certainly tons of planets in the Pluto size-range out these, and maybe even larger ones. Even after the Oort cloud you would still have a lot of these deep space rogue planets which could bridge the gap to another solar system’s Oort Cloud. So if you have fusion you have no shortage of energy, and could colonize trillions of these bodies. There probably is a decent amount of rock and metal out there too, but that could be your major import/export option shipping home ice and shipping out metals. 

That’s the end of the Solar System so that’s the end of this video. If you haven’t already watched the other half, colonizing the inner Solar System, head on over now, Fraser, tell them what we’re looking at... 

Hi Isaac Arthurians, Fraser Cain here. You’ve learned about the colonization of the Outer Solar System, now follow me to the colonization of the Inner Solar System. We’ll talk about orbital colonies in the Lagrange points, harvesting the Moon’s sweet sweet helium, and find out what it takes to survive on heat-scorched Mercury. 

Okay if you haven’t already left, presumably having seen the inner solar system first, let me say a big thank you to Fraser Cain, I’ve been reading his articles for years and it was great to work with him. Next week we will be looking at Space Warfare and talking about some of the options and common misconceptions in science fiction. So if you want alerts when that and other videos come out make sure to subscribe to the channel, and if you enjoyed this episode try out some of the others. Until then, thanks for watching, and have a Great Day!

The Stellar Compendium

So today we will be going through all the various star types, from the tiniest category of brown dwarf stars up to monstrously huge Wolf-Rayet stars, and from the normal main sequence stars to some strictly hypothetical ones composed of Dark Matter or types of particles we’re not even sure exist. 

We will also be trying to simplify a lot of the concepts in astronomy that tend to get used a lot but generally not well explained. 

Often the biggest problem people have mastering astronomy and astrophysics is the terminology itself, and a lot of that comes from terms that have antique origins or had to do with how we discovered them, not so much how they function. 

We will try to clear that away. 

So loosely we will discuss the following topics in the following order. 

1. 

The Harvard Classification System 2. 

The Yerkes Classification System &amp; Lifetime 3. 

Population, Metallicity, and Formation 4. 

Abnormal Stars 5. 

Dead Stars 6. 

Hypothetical Stars &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, there’s a decent chance you have never heard of the Harvard Classification System but you have heard it used all the time. 

You’ve heard our own sun referred to as a G-type star or a G2 yellow star, that’s the Harvard Classification system. 

Some quick history is needed here, we have obviously known about the stars a long time but we only knew them by how bright they were and what color they were. 

We didn’t know how far away they were for instance, and we didn’t learn that as soon as we invented telescopes. 

We can’t even see the nearest star for instance, Proxima Centauri, with the naked eye, but we can see V762 Cas, which is over 16,000 light years away, 4000 times further off than Proxima. 

We can only see a few thousands stars with the naked eye, maybe double that if you’ve got great vision and great observing conditions, but there are a few billion stars closer to us than that most distant visible star, V762 Cas. 

So visibility doesn’t particularly indicate proximity. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once we had telescopes though we could obviously see a lot more stars and we could also zoom in on one, by itself, and set up some instrument to measure the components of that light. 

How much red or yellow or infrared light was coming off it for instance. 

We could also measure its total brightness, its total luminosity, across all wavelengths even those invisible to our eyes by use of a device called a bolometer. 

This gives us the term bolometric luminosity, and it differs from normal luminosity in that the former is all the light given off by a star across every wavelength. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By and large stars give off light in a spectrum of wavelengths based off their surface temperature, but it generally is not a smooth curve because of various substances floating around on top of them absorbing some of that light and re-emitting it at a different wavelength. 

That results in some very jagged spectra, especially for hydrogen, the main component of stars, which sucks up light and re-emits it at specific frequencies. 

4 of which are in the visible range of light and these were discovered Johann Balmer in 1885. 

So suddenly they could look at a star’s spectra and tell how much hydrogen it had. 

You can do the same for other elements and for frequencies outside the visible band, and also what they absorb, so you will often hear about absorption and emission lines, but for our purposes today we don’t care about that. 

That’s just how we identify the stars and how the system originated. 

The original system assigned each star type a letter based on how much hydrogen could be seen in their spectra, with A having the most, B the second most, and so on, for 22 in total, A to V. 

This original system, sometimes called the Draper Catalogue, just measured hydrogen, and was put together by Edward Pickering and his assistant Williamina Fleming, best known for her discovery of the Horsehead Nebula in 1888. 

Draper was an astronomer who did a lot of the groundwork for photography in astronomy and after he died his widow agreed to fund Pickering’s work, though Williamina Fleming did most of the actual classification. 

She got her career in astronomy started as Pickering’s house maid at Harvard and was the first member of what became known as the Harvard Computers, 80 or so women employed to do calculations back when computer was a job title not a device. 

Another one of them, Annie Cannon, formalized the classification system later on based on temperature, but the original version Pickering and Fleming made was a bit more cumbersome. 

Unfortunately she used it as the base so we got stuck with a bunch of letters that basically mean nothing anymore and is hard to memorize. 

From hottest to coldest they are O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, and if you are familiar with those and ever wondered why those letters were picked in that order, now you know. 

The original system, the one used in the Draper Catalog, focused on how much hydrogen they could detect in the absorption lines and it stuck around when Cannon made the modern system, the Harvard Classifications. 

These also all correspond to colors, red is coldest and blue hottest. 

She was also kind enough to come up with a mnemonic for remembering those, “Oh be a Fine Girl, Kiss Me.” So now we had a system for temperature but still none for any other attribute, and an M-Type star, the coldest, can be either the smallest stars or the largest, for instance. 

It also is a bit vague even about temperature, so we follow each letter up with a number 0 to 9, 0 being hottest and 9 coldest. 

So the hottest star would be an O0 and the coldest an M9. 

Our sun is a G2, making it in the third hottest zone of the G-type stars, themselves the third coldest of the original categories. 

Again, these categories tell us nothing about how old a star is or how big it is or bright it is by itself, for that we needed something more. 

So in the 1943, at Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, Wilson Morgan, Philip Keenan, and Edith Kellman came up with an additional classification system to cover total brightness. 

This is sometimes known as the Yerkes Spectral Classification system, for the observatory, and sometimes the MK system for Morgan and Keenan, for the two men, and nowadays MKK to include Edith Kellman. 

Like the Harvard Scale this one has been added to over the years but originally they just had five, 1 through 5, done in Roman Numerals. 

And these just come after the Harvard scale of a letter, then a number, then a Roman Numeral. 

So our sun for instance is a G2-5, not a G2V, most stars talked about are V’s, or 5s, because most stars are 5s or Vs. 

This indicates a main-sequence star. 

1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are respectively 1, Supergiants, 2, Bright Giants, 3, &nbsp;Normal Giants, 4, Sub Giants, and 5, Main Sequence. 

Again in Roman Numerals, and after the letter and number of the Harvard Scale. 

You might be wondering why there are no normal stars or dwarfs on that scale, and in fact we have added one to it in recent years, for sub-dwarfs, and another for white dwarfs, and broke up category one into various extremes of brightness, but again no dwarfs or normals. 

This is an example of terms changing as we learned more. 

Originally category 5 was dwarves, and that’s essentially a relic of when most stars we could see were unsurprisingly the brightest stars. 

Our sun gets classified as a Dwarf Star for this reason, even though it is bigger than more than 90% of other stars. 

And Main Sequence is a weird word too, you’ve probably heard it enough times that you don’t really think of it anymore but when we are talking about size and brightness, supergiant this and bright giant that, it does seem a bit bizarre to have the term ‘main sequence’, like you had a table for describing people’s height, giant and dwarf, but instead of just ‘normal’ or ‘average’ you have some weird term like ‘standard doorway clearance’ or ‘comfortable shelf access’. 

That’s basically what happened here. 

As we began measuring brightness of stars, their actual brightness, not how dim they are to us based on distance from us, we began plotting them. 

Back in 1910 Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Russel plotted a bunch of the stars by their Harvard spectral class, the O, B, A, F, G, K, and M thingy, and by their Luminosity, their brightness. 

Or basically by their temperature versus their brightness. 

This is unsurprisingly a logarithmic scale since the plot goes from things thousands of times dimmer than our sun to thousands of times brighter. 

You get some noticeable clumps this way and one is a big thick line we call the main sequence. 

Most stars were on that main sequence, and the name just stuck, basically as a way of saying that star was normal. 

As we learned more we added to it, but in the basic original system the biggest brightest stars were type 1, supergiants, and this could be a very massive hot star or a large, cooler, and lower mass red supergiant. 

A star’s total brightness is based on its temperature and diameter. 

Double the diameter, quadruple the brightness or luminosity. 

But for temperature it goes up even quicker, double temperature and you increase luminosity sixteen-fold. 

Some stars are very hot and tiny, like white dwarfs, other are huge and cool, like red giants. 

The Harvard scale tells us temperature, but Yerkes doesn’t tell us a specific dimension like age or width or brightness, it tell us which area of the HR diagram the star is in. 

It’s more like a map location, like continents or chains of islands. 

They’ve just got numbers and names, not just names like North America or Asia. 

Astronomers usually say the names and write the numbers. 

Now there are reasons why the stars are in these groups rather than randomly and evenly distributed, and it mostly relates to how old they are, in terms of how long they will live. 

Stars burn through their hydrogen at a rate based on their mass. 

Only the very smallest stars actually get to use all that hydrogen since they are fully convective, which basically just means stuff near the surface can float down to the core and stuff in the core where fusion is going on can drift up to the top. 

The smallest stars are fully convective, one just a bit bigger actually have a big drop off in this, and it rises again when you get to stars in our sun’s mass range, but is still pretty low. 

But the bigger stars don’t live nearly as long, some live only a few million years, while the smallest stars can live trillions of years. 

You probably already know that and you might even be familiar with a rule of thumb that let’s you determine a star’s lifetime based off its mass. 

Most folks think a main sequence star when it runs out fuel becomes a red giant but there’s more to it than that. 

For instance our sun gets brighter every year, about 1% brighter every hundred million years. 

I’ve never heard anyone phrase it this way before and it’s probably from my own big focus on megastructures and Dyson Spheres but the sun’s brightness increases every five years by about what is needed to illuminate the planet Earth. 

So if you are building a giant dyson swarm around your sun you can add about a planet’s worth of new living area every five years, or a space the size of the US or Europe every month or so. 

Eventually it will run out of hydrogen in its core, just the core though, if our sun used all its hydrogen it would live closer to a hundred billion years. 

Many stars, as they begin getting to the end of the main sequence, growing brighter, have a sub-giant phase, class IV on the Yerkes system. 

This is generally a relatively short phase though its exact characteristics depend on the star’s mass, but basically the star just gets decently brighter, noticeably more than it was already doing just from aging. 

All stars have a main sequence phase, their main phase of their life essentially, and will pass through a subgiant phase as well before becoming a giant, though the lightest stars never become giants. 

At least we think so, the fact of the matter is that virtually no stars less massive than our own sun have ever left the main sequence. 

The Universe isn’t old enough for them to have even if they were among the first to form 13 billion years ago. 

No M or K class main sequence star, red or orange dwarf stars, has ever died of old age, and they are the supermajority of stars. 

The only stars to leave the main sequence yet are ones more massive than our own sun or those just a little bit less massive which also formed way back near the beginning of time. 

Most stars are red or orange dwarfs and partially because they have longevity, big stars don’t live long. 

Anyway we always have to be a bit speculative when talking about phases for things less massive than our own sun since even though that is most stars the universe just isn’t old enough for us to have actually witnessed what happens to them when they leave the main sequence. 

As I said though, current thinking is the very lightest of stars don’t even have a giant phase. 

Leaving the main sequence, and going through type 4, subgiant, they arrive at normal red giant phase, type 3. 

Now here we have another example of bad terminology. 

A red giant is always an old star, one that left the main sequence and expanded and cooled. 

It might have been a G or F or A type star beforehand but it is an M-type now, and it has expanded so much it can have enveloped its inner planets and even a close binary neighbor. 

But we often use the term giant to refer to very large main sequence stars too, like a blue giant, and this can get kinda of confusing. 

Also, amusingly, while we think of things getting swallowed and vaporized when this happens those planets or stars would just keep orbiting inside it, albeit that orbit would decay and those planets would be roasted, but slowly roasted. 

This is because while the red giant is quite hot, it’s thinner than air. 

So properly insulated you probably could dive a spaceship into one for a while. 

Type II are the bright giants, and these can come in any color, any letter on the Harvard Class, O through M, blue through red. 

A Blue Bright giant would be a main sequence star while a red bright giant would be a dying star that had been fairly large to begin with. 

When stars leave the main sequence they don’t just expand overnight or contract afterwards, with the exception of the really big ones that outright explode, which is not an instant process either but the timelines are a lot shorter. 

The next category, type 1, are supergiants and again these can run the whole spectra, but they are inevitably a very massive star on the main sequence or a pretty massive star near the end of its life. 

We also further subdivide this category by how bright they are and you will sometimes see a type 0 called a hypergiant. 

It’s not that there are so many of these stars out there that we actually needed a new class, it’s just that we can see them so far away that they are pretty easy to catalog and they are often yellow, because stars that massive have stability issues that tend to make them physically larger and cooler than we’d expect. 

So it isn’t that color, or temperature, of a star doesn’t tell you a lot about that star, it's just that unless you are an astronomer you are almost always better off looking at stars using the Harvard plus Yerkes notation for that little V, the roman numeral 5, and if you see that you know it is a regular old hydrogen burner in the prime of its life, and the letter than tells you its mass based off the temperature or color. 

If you don’t see that V, or 5, at the end, you will be safe assuming it is either dying, huge, or weird, or some combination of all 3. 

But we talked about dying, and we’ll talk about it more in a bit, let’s talk about star formation for a bit. 

Stars tend to form out of nebulae, big dense pockets of gas that generally spawn a whole bunch of stars when something comes by and pushes on that gas or otherwise sets off a wave of star formation. 

These stars won’t all form exactly simultaneously but on astronomical timelines they more or less do, and they generally will stay together, occasionally having one meander off or a migrant join for a while or even permanently. 

These clusters and groups of stars tend to be about the same age but not the same mass. 

Stars tend to form in clumps and be of the same age, and we often refer to these ages as populations. 

Another weird bit of terminology, we have population 1 and 2 stars and even added 3 in recent years, and this actually refers to their metal content, but its called a population because the stars in a group tend to be of the same age and so you’d be looking at a big group, or population, of stars and trying to determine their age by how much metal they had in them. 

Metallicity in astronomy refers to any element besides hydrogen and helium in a star, not just things like iron or copper but stuff like carbon and oxygen too. 

As you know the heavier elements mostly come from stars that died making them and sprayed them out into the cosmos, so the oldest stars, ones that formed long ago, have a lot less of these metals in them while the ones that formed more recently have a lot more. 

Population 1 stars, or metal rich stars, are younger stars, and our sun is one. 

Population 2 are metal poor stars, meaning they are old, and population 3 is ultra-poor, and these are the very oldest stars, ones that formed near the beginning of things. 

Now metal content doesn’t just tell us about age, higher metallicity star are cooler than equal mass stars with lower metallicity, because it’s also got those metals down in its hydrogen burning core interfering with fusion. 

Which also make them live longer though as I said in the starlifitng episode if you want to extend a star’s lifetime you’d just remove mass from it, even those metals, since they extend lifetime but their sheer presence still adds to the mass and gravity of that star to increase fusion, just not as much as hydrogen would, and it would only matter if the star was on the convective side. 

Okay so we have our picture now of the main types of stars, so let’s talk about some of the abnormal ones. 

On the smaller side we have type-L, in this case because it is the letter right before M. These are hot brown dwarf stars, and they would give off a little bit of light, brown dwarfs are not brown, but would look a dim orange-red or magenta. 

Next down are T-type, and I’ve never found out the origin of that one, but these are Methane Dwarfs. 

Not because they are made of all Methane, but because they have some. 

You do not get a lot of molecules forming on the surfaces of stars, from the heat, but T-type are quite cool. 

Compared to other stars anyway, they are still warm enough to melt lead. 

The last new type, Y-class, are called Ultra-Cool Brown Dwarfs. 

They are not hot enough to melt lead, though still quite hot. 

I have no idea where the Y comes from either, but these are cool enough that some might even have water clouds in their atmospheres. 

Brown dwarf stars, the smallest stars and arguably not stars at all, can be anywhere between 13 and 80 Jupiter Masses, or about 4000 to 27,000 times more massive than Earth or about 0.13% to 0.8% of the Sun’s mass. 

In spite of this almost all of them are about the same size as Jupiter. 

They just keep getting denser and denser as they get more massive until they are massive enough for fusion. 

Once they get over 80 Jupiter Masses they become the dimmest of red dwarf stars, or M9’s. 

Hypothetically they can burn deuterium for a few million years, as it takes less effort to fuse, but there wouldn’t be a lot of it. 

If you’re in the star making business you could probably make rather smalls stars made only out of it deuterium but in nature it occurs at part per million. 

We don’t know just yet how common brown dwarf stars are, they definitely are not uncommon but they could outnumber all other stars. 

People wonder about living around a brown dwarf, like if a large moon could be habitable. 

The answer is probably yes since you could have a lot of heating from both tidal forces on the moon, something we discussed back in the Habitable Planets series, and from some light off the brown dwarf, even if virtually all of it was in the infrared range. 

We also have, back on the other side of the size scale, Class W, for Wolf-Rayet Stars, these are so big and huge that you can see them thousands of light years away with your naked eye. 

We used to think no star could form above a certain mass, because we didn’t observe any beyond a certain luminosity, known as the Eddington Limit. 

But we noticed some of the brightest acted a bit weird. 

Their spectra wasn’t right, too much helium and nitrogen and carbon. 

We realized these were a lot more massive than their luminosity indicated, and we have known of them for a long time, they are very uncommon but so bright we can actually see two of them with the naked eye. 

One of them, Gamma Velorum, is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, but they’re both in the southern hemisphere unlike 90% of my audience. 

What happens with these stars is that they are too big to be stable. 

They have very high solar winds and regularly belch off swathes of matter. 

That’s why they seem to have too much helium, carbon, and nitrogen, their outer layers get flung off. 

You will also hear a lot about Variable Stars, particularly Cepheid Variables. 

A variable star is just one whose brightness varies, and there are tons of types. 

These come in two major categories though, intrinsic and extrinsic, extrinsic variable stars have something causing us to see its luminosity change. 

Intrinsically variable stars have something about the star actually altering its luminosity, which is true of every star but we use the term for big changes, like the star swells in size then shrinks. 

There are dozens of classes of variables but the Cepheid, named for the first we noticed this with, the star Delta Cephei, is historically significant. 

Cepheids expand and contract in a very regular way and are big bright stars, so they were instrumental for two big things. 

First, Edwin Hubble used them to show that distant nebulae were actually galaxies, something that was already proposed but they settled the matter for good, and second they were key to the original determination that the Universe was expanding, again something Hubble found. 

There are too many of these to list right now and most are important just for astronomy so I’ll bypass the others, but that’s what variable stars are and why they are so important. 

Time to move onto dead stars, the three popularly known ones are white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes but we have quite a few other including some hypothetical ones like Iron stars, so this will spill over into our final category. 

White Dwarfs are the most common fate of a star, anything less massive than 8 times our sun’s mass end up as one, which means virtually all stars. 

Not only are stars bigger than that less common in the sky because they are short-lived, they also don’t form as often as smaller ones. 

Also, as mentioned earlier, the only white dwarfs around are those from stars as massive as our own or bigger so exact behavior of the ones that will come as less massive stars die in the future is still a bit speculative. 

In the future we would probably have white dwarfs composed mostly of helium from stars that were not massive enough to fuse helium into carbon and oxygen and other elements. 

Your average white Dwarf is about the size of Earth because it is a leftover stellar core of something that blew all it outer shell away when it went into final helium burning modes. 

We wouldn’t expect ones actually composed of just helium to be quite the same. 

Now when a red giant occurs you basically get a crunch in the center as the core starts burning helium or the inner shell burns hydrogen, when that is all done that big thin cloud that makes up virtually all the volume and a fair chunk of the mass turns into a Planetary Nebula. 

The rest settles down as a dead but super dense and super hot planet sized white dwarf that is slowly cooling. 

Eventually it would become a red dwarf again for instance, in terms of being tiny and red, and eventually a black dwarf, one too cold to radiate light. 

The universe isn’t old enough for either of those yet either. 

In the meantime it is a super-hot super-dense thing you wouldn't want to dump hydrogen on because it can cause a nova. 

Just a regular old nova not the super kind. 

Nova being latin for new, a nova star, or new star, sometimes pops up in the night sky from a place where we couldn’t see a star before because it was too dim. 

Novae are quite bright for a little while and a lot more common than a supernova. 

Unlike supernovae that happen maybe a couple times a century in our galaxy, regular novae happen a couple times a month, but they are not so bright they you can see them across the galaxy. 

Still one happens close enough to make a new star visible to the naked eye every few years. 

Novae can vary a lot in brightness, since it just depends on how much hydrogen lands on them, and they can happen multiple times to the same star. 

Now a supernova is a more extreme event and can happen two ways, the first you know, it is when a really big star dies, but the more common kind is when a white dwarf absorbs enough mass to cross a threshold, about half again what the Sun masses, and it is too much for even the electron degenerate matter to handle and the white dwarf simply explodes. 

We are not quite sure as to the exact process but we think that when it crosses that mass boundary it’s enough to ignite carbon and oxygen fusion and get some convection going on to stir the star, and that after about a thousand years that results in a detonation, ripping the white dwarf apart rather than just causing it to collapse into a neutron star. 

In any event that is a Type 1A Supernova. 

Now not all Type 1a Supernovae tear the star apart, sometimes, we think, they leave behind a remnant called a Zombie Star, one that might have about half the mass left over. 

This would be a lot like a white dwarf, just a less massive one, but still basically a white dwarf. 

A Superhot super-dense planet-sized object that is going to slowly cool off since it no longer has any fusion going on. 

You could conceivably live around one of these but they are a lot dimmer than normal stars and keep getting dimmer and dimmer. 

Incidentally, Supernova Types 1b and 1c involve very large stars too, like the Type 2’s, the Wolf-Rayet stars I mentioned earlier, so type 1a, the most common type, are the only ones involving white dwarf stars. 

There used to just be types 1 and 2, and type 1 meant we didn’t see any hydrogen in the explosion, it all got fused or scattered long before. 

Type 2 does have hydrogen in it. 

These are the classic supernova you are most familiar with, big stars that explode and leave behind a neutron star or a black hole. 

These occur in stars heavy enough to ignite more fusion, and the highest element you can form this way is iron so the very biggest stars end as supernova when their core turns into iron, these then get imploded by the supernova into neutrons stars. 

We estimate there are 100 million to one billion neutron stars in our galaxy out of many hundreds of billion of stars, but many would be old and have cooled down. 

They’re quite small, no bigger than a small moon or large mountain, so they only emit a lot of light when they are very young and hot. 

They also tend to rotate very quickly, having kept most of the angular momentum of the parent star but squeezed in tight like when an ice skater twirling around bring their arms in and spins faster. 

So they rotate several times a second, or even hundreds of times a second, unlike most stars which rotate in days or months. 

This causes beams of electromagnetic radiation to come off them which we can see if we’re at the right angle and when they are young and hot. 

Those ones are called Pulsars, we’ve found about 2000 in our galaxy, and there are presumably at least ten times as many that are just at the wrong angle for us to see, but a Pulsar is just a young neutron star titled at the right angle relative to us. 

Now as you know a black hole is hypothesized to be what you get when an even bigger star goes off and we have talked about them a lot before in other videos so we’ll skim it for now and slide into hypothetical stars because many of them are thought to be intermediary stages between neutron stars and black holes. 

Neutron stars get their name because they are made up of nothing but neutrons. 

White dwarfs are under so much gravity and pressure, without any fusion to push back, that you can’t really have atoms anymore, just a sea of atomic nuclei and electrons, electron-degenerate matter, it’s too crunched up for electrons to wrap around nuclei and space atoms out. 

Neutrons stars are so dense you can't even have protons and electrons anymore, just neutrons. 

A neutron left to itself usually decays into a proton and electron, or their antiparticles, this is essentially the reverse process. 

But protons and neutrons are both made up of quarks, and under enough pressure it might be that even neutrons can’t exist anymore and you get a big mess of quarks. 

Or a quark star. 

This might be a short phase right before a black hole forms or maybe a stable one where inside a neutron star is a core of raw quarks. 

Probably Strange Quarks too, rather than the up and down quarks that make up most matter. 

We do have a few neutron stars that seem a bit too dense, and it’s been suggested they might be quark stars, or have a quark core at least. 

They don’t necessarily drop into black holes after that either. 

We still have four more possible steps. 

One option is the Electroweak Star, named for the unified electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces that occur at high enough energies. 

Here the collapsing neutron or quark star would have a super-dense core about the size of your fist with a couple planet’s worth of mass jammed in, and the rest all around it still at the lower but still absurdly high densities of neutron or quark stars. 

Gravity is too strong for even quarks to exist at that core and those quarks are being converted into leptons… electrons are a type of lepton, they have no quarks. 

This energy keeps the star from collapsing further and it’s been suggested this could go on for millions of years before the jig is up. 

From the outside it would still look like a neutron or quark star presumably. 

Another option is a Boson Star. 

Bosons are particles that can be in the same place as other particles. 

Fermions, what regular matter is made out of, cannot be in the exact same place as another fermion. 

Quarks, protons, neutrons, and even leptons like the electron are fermions and cannot occupy the exact same place as another fermion. 

A boson can, and photons, the particle of light, are an example of a boson. 

Considering a radio wave, or radio photon, can be bigger than your house, it would be kind of hard to listen to the radio otherwise. 

One of the candidates for Dark Matter, which we discussed in its own episode, is the Axion, and it has been suggested it could be a type of boson that could form this sort of star or even start a star off this way if it were made back in the Big Bang. 

Boson Stars are also a candidate for Dark Matter, though I skipped them in that episode for here. 

We also have other options for Dark Matter stars, or Dark Stars, which we’ll get to in a moment. 

Another option is a Preon Star, Preons are another hypothetical particle, originally suggested to be what quarks and leptons were composed of. 

There’s no evidence they exist but there’s always an understandable desire for some most basic particle all the others are built out of and Preons were one of the more popular ones, much like Strings from String Theory. 

Like Boson stars they are also a candidate for dark matter and could have been formed in the Big Bang, or in a supernova. 

Both of these are much denser than even a neutron or quark star. 

The densest though is the Planck Star, and these are not a last step before a black hole but thought to be what might be at the center of a black hole. 

We don’t know that a black hole is actually point-like, and I mean the mass at the middle, the actual black hole is just the region around it where gravity is too high for light to escape, that rises linearly with mass, double the mass, double the diameter of that event horizon, but we don’t know that matter keeps compacting after that until it simply becomes an tiny dot of zero width. 

A Planck Star is one option for the core of a black hole, and they are insanely dense. 

About 10^97 kilograms per cubic meter, which for scale, the whole observable universe is only about 10^52 kilograms so if squeezed down to Planck Density it would fit into single atomic nucleus, and remember an atomic nuclei is very small compared to an atom, like the Sun is to the solar system. 

A Planck Star would be similarly tiny compared to an atomic nuclei, but with a whole star’s mass crammed into them. 

Needless to say these are also a candidate for dark matter though again the key notion is that they might be the actual center of a black hole. 

Now the last two we are going to look at are not dead stars, although one is probably an extinct class that no longer exists and the other is a kind that won’t exist until everything else is dead. 

Dark Stars, stars made entirely of dark matter, are considered something that might have existed early on in the Universe when things were more packed together. 

Depending on how dark matter actually behaves you could get clumps of it mixed with normal matter that prevented that matter from achieving the density necessary for fusion. 

Such stars would radiate very little light even though they could be bigger than our solar system. 

We talked about these more in the Dark Matter episode but they are hypothetical and almost certainly no longer exist. 

Our last is Iron Stars, and they are the ones we’d probably focus on if I ever do a sequel to the Civilizations at the End of Time video that focused on Black Holes. 

The Star Forming era of the Universe will end in about a hundred trillions years, we’re about 1% of 1% of the way through it. 

We talked in that episode about how potentially that might be just the beginning of real civilization as expansion drives cooling that allows hyper-efficient computing. 

But that era lasted at most 10^100 years, just a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, times longer than the Stellar Phase of which we are again only a percent of a percent through. 

Some folks asked me if things could keep going after that and there are a few options. 

For matter that hasn’t been swallowed into a black hole during all that time, say an old white dwarf or neutron star left on its own, and assuming protons do not decay, given enough time, and we are talking timelines that make the entire black hole era seem as short to it as a second is to that era, you can have cold fusion occur. 

The insane improbability of a cold fusion event occurring by quantum tunneling is one of the reasons physicists roll their eyes at this or that cold fusion device. 

It’s easier at super-cold temperatures but it is still so improbable that to convert an entire stellar mass object into iron would take timelines only meaningful in scientific notation. 

10^1500 years. 

That’s a ten followed by an entire page of zeroes. 

As mentioned earlier, iron is the heaviest element formed by fusion so eventually, given a long enough time, and assuming protons don’t decay, everything should end as iron. 

Of course that isn’t necessarily the end of the universe but we will save that for another time, I think. 

Iron stars are the last of our hypothetical stars both for the Universe and this video. 

Speaking of future episodes, this episode was originally planned for next week, as you may know we were going to do Colonizing the Outer Solar System this week, but Fraser Cain, the Publisher of Universe Today, offered to collaborate on a video. 

We both latched onto discussing colonizing the outer, and inner, solar system and while at first we thought we could get it done by the original planned air date we decided to give ourselves a bit more breathing room, so that is next week. 

And I suspect we will both be doing a lot of more in-depth looks at that topic so make sure to subscribe to my channel, and his as well, for updates when that and other videos come out. 

As mentioned this episode was also the third Patreon winner we had, the topic being selected by Neo Navras, our prior two being the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium selected by Drew McTygue and the second being Starlifting with Bill Mains. 

They were all great picks and I really enjoyed the process, Drew and I spent a couple hours on the phone bouncing ideas around for instance, so it is definitely something we will be continuing though I still haven't decided exactly how. 

Needless to say I am very grateful to the channels Patreon supporters for paying the bills for the channel and if you’d like to become one there’s a link to the channel’s patreon account in the episode description. 

Again next week is Colonizing the Solar System.

Dark Flow & The Great Attractor
---
  
2016-11-03  
https://youtu.be/rbVoMaZwH4M  

---

So today we finish up what I have nicknamed the Dark Trilogy with our look at Dark Flow &amp; the Great Attractor. 

We previously looked at Dark Matter in the first episode and then Dark Energy, and as I said back when we began these three phenomena do not have too much in common besides  the word Dark. 

Also this week we are doing a collaboration episode with fellow Youtuber Joe Scott, who will be looking at the Great Attractor and you can click over to that video now, this video will just pause and open his in a new window, or at the end of the episode when I’ll bring the link up again. 

It will also be linked down in the video description for those of you watching from platforms that don’t allow in-video links. 

If you are visiting from Joe’s channel and are new here, you’re encouraged to turn on the closed captions for this episode as my speech impediment can take a little getting used to. 

Okay, so what is Dark Flow? 

As you know just about everything outside of our galaxy and its nearest neighbors is moving away from us, and the further away they are the faster they are moving away. 

Indeed, as we discussed in the Dark Energy video that expansion seems to be accelerating too, so that it looks like a trillion years down the road almost all the Universe we can reach will be within a million or so light years of use even though the Observable Universe will be trillions of light years wide and most of what is in the currently Observable Universe will have sailed over the horizon leaving us alone. 

The speed things move away from us from the Hubble Expansion is proportional to their distance from us. 

Get twice as far away and the velocity is twice as high, so anything already at galactic distance moving away from us will just keep moving away faster and faster. 

But things do not have an exact velocity based solely on their distance from us, much like everything else they move relative to each other so two galaxies nearby each other might be moving away from us at a rate of 1000 kilometers a second but one is only moving away at say, 990 km/s and the other at 1010 km/s. 

We would expect that. 

Same the moons around Mars or Jupiter keep pace with their planets but might be moving toward us a bit or away from us a bit while performing their own orbits. 

Galaxies tend to exist in clumps too, so it is no surprise some might be moving toward us or away from us, relative to their cluster even if that cluster is receding away from us. 

Local motions, we would expect them all to average out. 

Indeed we almost have to since our main way to determine the distance of very distant objects is to look at how fast they are moving away from us by their redshift. 

If we saw those two galaxies form a moment ago, we might not even realize at first they were near each other, just in the same direction, because we are guessing their distance from their velocities and they’re not the same. 

It can be quite difficult to look at groups of galaxies and figure out what each one’s velocity relative to that area is, what is called their peculiar velocity. 

In this sense we use the word peculiar not to mean strange or odd, we’ll get to the strange and odd motion in a moment, but in its other meaning, of something belonging exclusively to. 

In fact that is the original meaning, and it meaning strange or odd came later. 

Much as I might say that cliff diving is a hobby I consider peculiar to those sorts of people who like their hobbies suicidally reckless, and how we might say those people are a bit strange, and so peculiar in that way too. 

But I digress, we use the term peculiar velocity to refer to a things velocities when we cut away the component from Hubble Expansion so we can talk about how group of galaxies move relative to each other. 

Now we would expect that to average out to zero. 

So it came as a bit of a surprise in 2008 when we noticed a lot of galaxies seemed to be moving, in terms of peculiar velocity, in a specific direction. 

They were flowing that way for no apparent reason, presumably form a source of gravity we could not see. 

This gave us the term Dark Flow. 

Now two things came up right away. 

First the motion is headed toward a place we called the Great Attractor, having already noticed all the way back in the 1970s that galaxies in our supercluster were drifting that way. 

Irritatingly the Great Attractor happens to be in the Zone of Avoidance, whose somewhat dramatic sounding name probably helped add the mystery value with the public. 

It’s a huge chunk of the night sky taking up fully 20% of it. 

The Zone of Avoidance sounds like a place you would expect to be where space pirates hung out or maybe some evil galactic empire. 

It used to be called the Zone of Few Nebulae which isn’t much better because now it sounds like some empty place Cthulu would go for naps. 

However Nebulae is what we used to call other galaxies, as I mentioned back in the Dark Matter episode, we confused them with Nebula in our own galaxy and didn’t realize how far away and huge they were. 

This was a zone of the sky in which few were found. 

You could also consider the Zone of Avoidance the second zone of avoidance, since telescopes can rotate in which way but you usually want to avoid pointing them down at ground. 

If you don’t avoid pointing your telescope at ground you won’t see many stars. 

The Zone of Audience is just a term that refers to the chunk of the sky our galaxy occupies and all the stars and dust make it quite difficult to see distant galaxies on the other side of it. 

Hence you avoid looking at that zone if you want to study distant galaxies. 

In that respect it isn’t too surprising that the Great Attractor lies in that direction, 20% of the Universe lies in that direction after all. 

Now when this first got noticed back in the 70’s the assumption was that there was probably a lot matter we couldn’t see over there. 

Some folks took ‘We can’t see it’ to imply it must be some giant super-colossal black hole, but again the lack of visibility is because our galaxy is in the way. 

The main assumption was there was just a ton of galaxies in that direction. 

That was still interesting at the time because we had still been assuming the universe was pretty evenly spread, not all clumped together into lines and walls and huge voids. 

Whichever the case, as the years rolled by there were arguments about the method and how much mass was actually there, which was kind of difficult to rigorously measure with us not being able to see the stuff closest to it to take measurements either. 

It’s estimated to be around 200 million light years away, which is very far away though also quite close on the scale of the Observable Universe. 

The observable Universe is a couple hundred times wider than the volume encompassing our galaxy and the Great Attractor and several million times bigger in terms of mass and volume. 

In 2008 though we got new data and we saw that there seemed to be a much larger volume of space moving towards this spot. 

For a while some were even thinking the whole Universe might be headed in that direction and that the Great attractor might not be some spot a couple hundred million light years away but actually billions of light years away, possibly outside the Observable Universe. 

And that’s allowable too. 

The Observable Universe is not the whole Universe, just those parts we can see, and we have no idea how big the whole Universe is, it may indeed be infinite, it may just be a little bigger than the Observable part, but the main assumption is that it is at least much, much larger than what we can see. 

If the Universe didn’t start off very evenly spread there could have been a super huge chunk of mass just over the Cosmological horizon in some direction causing a drift. 

Now gravity does move at the speed of light, for some reason I still hear folks so it is instantaneous and I have no idea where that comes from. 

Though amusingly if you think of gravity as being made of gravitons, in the same light is made of photons, that does raise some eyebrows about how gravity itself escapes from black holes. 

So no mass that’s already fled over the cosmological horizon is exerting force on us anymore. 

The Cosmological Horizon is the imaginary line where space is expanding faster than the speed of light so no light from galaxies beyond that every reaches us again, and also no gravity. 

That doesn’t mean it wasn’t pulling on us in the past or isn’t pulling still on things nearer to it, causing a net drift, or flow. 

Now this stirred a lot of speculation and ideas but before you go off contemplating those, not only was Dark Flow at the Universal scale never particularly accepted, it more or less got skewered in 2013 when we got the data from the ESA’s Planck Space Telescope. 

It should no evidence of dark flow on the Universal scale. 

This does not mean Dark Flow was debunked, because it is just a term for large scale flow of galaxies in some direction where that direction can’t be seen well enough to get too specific about the cause. 

And by cause I mean the source of the gravity, I’m not implying some weird new force or phenomena. 

It would not be limited to just our area of the Universe and the Great Attractor but by and large those flows at very distant location won’t be dark to us since we won’t be sitting in the middle of the flow with its center obscured by our galaxy being in the way. 

At the same time I do not want to imply this is not a mystery. 

Or that it is not important. 

It is both. 

In fact in recent years you may have heard the emergence of the term the Laniakea Supercluster. 

This is our Supercluster of galaxies that we live in. 

You might not be familiar with it because we used to call our Supercluster the Virgo Supercluster, but the emerging evidence would seem to point to it just being a decent sized chunk of a larger construct including a few more super cluster all center around the Great Attractor. 

The Laniakea Supercluster, our new supercluster, centered on the Great Attractor, is half a billion light years across and contains a total mass of around 10,000 Trillion times our own sun’s mass. 

That’s many thousands of galaxies and many hundreds of galaxy clusters. 

The name derives from Hawaiian and means Immense Heaven, presumably because it is impolite to name everything in Greek, although more likely because we are running out of Greek words we haven’t already used for something else. 

Now when we say things are moving toward it, they actually are not. 

They are mostly moving away from it but not as fast as they should be. 

As a rule Galactic Supercluster are too far spread out not to be ripped apart by the expansion of the Universe, regular galactic clusters are not, so our neighboring galaxies ought to stay with us till the end of time and eventually merge with us. 

Which they do all the time anyway, this week’s big science news was astronomers discovering there were ten times as many galaxies as previously thought and I got messaged dozens of times about it by folks wondering if it through dark matter and dark energy into the trash can. 

It did not, this is an example of way too much hype in science journalism. 

We already knew our galaxy like many of the bigger modern galaxies gobbled up tons of smaller neighbors. 

Our galaxy is a big cannibal gobbling up its neighbors, in fact it’s probably not our galaxy as it looks like we originated with the late Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. 

Everybody knows about the Large and Small Magellanic clouds, our two dwarf satellite galaxies, but as we learn more we can see the gutted carcasses of an awful lot of them floating around in us or near us, over 50 that have been identified though some are disputed and there could be more we ate so long ago we can’t see the traces. 

The big new discovery as a big discovery, but it was of the ‘finally some proof’ variety, not ‘Oh My God our theories are in ruins’ variety. 

They found a lot of dwarf galaxies when they looked far away in space and thus also far back in time. 

It was confirmation of what was expected, that there were a lot of smaller dimmer galaxies in the ancient universe most of which have merged together in modern times. 

They are going to keep merging too as the eons meander along, till you don’t have galactic cluster anymore, just single big galaxies, bigger than now, floating alone in the void with huge and ever-increasing distances to their neighboring galaxies. 

This is the confusion we see with the Great Attractor, again it isn’t that all these galaxies are moving toward it, as I said, they are not. 

It is probably not moving toward itself either since it is probably just a bunch of galaxies maybe slightly more densely packed than normal, or maybe just in the rough center of a fairly large supercluster. 

Things are moving away from it, but slower than they should be because there is a lot of gravity working against the Hubble Expansion presumably caused by Dark Energy. 

It does not necessarily mean this will all be torn apart though, just that if left to itself it will be. 

The Great Attractor has become a popular place in science fiction to have some mega-civilization that dwarfs even the galaxy-spanning Kardashev 3 civilizations we discussed in the recent episode on the Kardashev scale. 

As I mentioned way back in the Black Hole Farming episode, Civilizations at the End of Time, the way we predict the Universe to look in a few trillion years will almost certainly not be what it looks like if we ever get out and start colonizing other solar systems or anyone else has. 

And as I mentioned in the Kardashev Scale episode, you can move galaxies, same as you can move stars, something we showed in the Shkadov Thrusters episode was very effort intensive but not actually very high tech at all. 

If it turns out we have not only this whole galaxy to ourselves but the whole supercluster, it might make sense for us to race out ahead of the expansion and start shoving galaxies back toward us. 

We are not at the center of either our traditional Virgo Supercluster or the larger Laniakea Supercluster we think is centered around the Great Attractor, but with Dark Flow helping bind these things together it makes it a lot easier to push them to keep them together. 

So rather than a sphere of galaxies around our own being rescued from Hubble Expansion you might see such a sphere centered more around the Great Attractor, especially if there’s a handful of other civilizations living in the area who might want to team up and would probably be pretty evenly distributed throughout it. 

That is a case where teaming up is good since you’d end up with a larger overall number of galaxies than the combined number each would get working on its own. 

But if we have the place all to ourselves we might as well grab as much as we can, and in the same way we might expect a galactic empire to re-center itself from Earth to some place a bit more central to use as a capitol you might see the same thing happen for the supercluster and get some multi-galactic empire’s capitol located in the Great Attractor controlling tens of thousands of galaxies. 

I don’t think that is terribly likely, especially without at least some form of faster than light communication if not travel, but I always seem to be in a minority in thinking FTL is not in the cards. 

So good fuel for science fiction authors perhaps, beyond the Zone of Avoidance, deep inside the Great Attractor, lies the seat of an ancient empire ruling over 10,000 galaxies. 

So that’s Dark Flow, the mysterious motion of galaxies toward the Great Attractor, and it is still a mystery but hopefully less of one right now. 

That will also close out our look at Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Dark Flow. 

Next week we will be coming back much closer to home for a look at colonizing the outer solar system and the week after that we will be taking a look at some more astronomy to demystify a lot of the terms and concepts like we did today, and look at some of the more bizarre stars, in the Stellar Compendium. 

I’d like to thank Joe Scott from Answers with Joe for teaming up with me on this topic and if you’d like to hear some more fun stuff about the Great Attractor you can head on over to his channel to see that now, using the in-video link or the one in the episode description. 

And you can also come by the Facebook Group or sub-reddit, both titles Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, to talk with others but some of these concepts. 

You can also try out any of the episodes and playlists on this channel or over at the website, IsaacArthur.net. 

Again, next week is Colonizing the Outer Solar System, and until then, thanks for watching, and have a great day!

Bioforming and Gene Tailoring

Ah, Genetic Engineering, the field of science that will one day let us ride around dinosaurs &nbsp;throwing pokemon at each other. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So our topic today is bioforming and gene-tailoring, both basically extensions on genetic engineering, and initially I had thought we would keep it pretty practical and down to Earth, discuss things like CRISPR and the ways it can be used to fix health problems. 

We would look at ethical issues and potential benefits and concerns about this technology. 

And we will get to those, but then I found myself thinking, lots of folks have discussed that and discussed it well, and this channel does not generally focus on ‘Down to Earth’. 

Heck last episode I was talking about moving galaxies. 

So yes we will talk about the near-term applications and the ethical issues but we will push the envelope out a bit and explore some novel, even zany, applications of this sort of technology, though we will keep it the realm of what is allowed by known science or at least not forbidden by it. 

Which includes making dinosaurs, as in Jurassic Park, because honestly I can't think of many things cooler than riding around on a dinosaur and if you don’t think that’s awesome I think something is probably wrong with you, because that has to be ten times cooler than a horse or a Harley Davidson. 

Of course it is not as easy as in Jurassic Park, because DNA does get preserved for millions of years, but we will see today how you could do it anyway. 

How this technology can be used to recreate long extinct species and even engineer ones that never existed, like unicorns or chupacabra. 

Or even things which probably could not naturally evolve, like dragons or multi-headed hydras or intelligent trees. 

We also have potential practical applications, not just stuff like a species of corn that grows twice as much food or some algae that could tailored to be perfect for making biofuels and plastics but less obvious stuff like roads that grew and repaired themselves in ways similar to how coral reefs work or plants that could suck trace metals right out of the ground so we could harvest them rather than needed to mine them. 

Or even plants that might replace solar panels and let you just plug in to the field or forest for electricity. 

Stuff that just could not evolve naturally. 

Which does bring up the question of how we do this stuff and if it is ethical to do it. 

Yes it should be possible to make an intelligent tree or a human-horse hybrid, a centaur, or a human-fish hybrid, a mermaid, but is it ethical to do so? 

And how do we do so? 

For the ‘how?’ part there are a lot of options, but there are four approaches I wanted to look at briefly today. 

One is CRISPR, an exciting new technology people have been talking about a lot. 

Another is similar, use of retroviruses to go enact changes to DNA throughout an organism. 

The third is straight DNA Printing, which gives us the option to make strands of DNA from scratch straight off a computer model. 

And lastly we have the option of using nanotechnology, the Universal Assemblers we discussed some episodes back, to just get in there and make the changes at the molecular level if necessary. 

Before we jump into those, and we will be keeping them brief, I did want to take moment to differentiate Bioforming from Gene-Tailoring and both from Genetic Engineering. 

Bioforming we discussed in passing back in the Terraforming episode, as the alternative to Terraforming. 

When terraforming a planet you are trying to make it more Earth-like so people and Terran Flora and Fauna can live there. 

Bioforming, sometimes also called Pantropy, is the reverse, where you adapt Earth Organisms to live in Alien Environments. 

This does not necessarily have to be all that high-tech or alien, if you are dealing with a world already a lot like Earth but devoid of life. 

If it is not much like Earth, or already has life on it, you probably need to do some massive overhauling. 

Outside of science fiction you cannot land on an alien world with alien plants and animals and start eating them or introducing your own plants and animals. 

In all probability the best thing that will happen if you eat a bunch of alien fruits and nuts is that you will get very sick and spend a lot of time in the bathroom expelling those things from one or another of your orifices. 

A lot our own plants can be quite toxic, heck, as I was reminded when watching a recent episode of Cody’s Lab, a lot of regular edible plants contain cyanide, just in low enough dosages that we have adapted to be able to survive eating them. 

There might be some planets that work on similar enough biochemistry that you can eat the food, or some of it, but in all probability you cannot and if you introduce Terran Flora and Fauna either it will die out or it will wipe out the native life. 

Most of us would say those would be bad things, so the alternative is a fairly massive overhaul of our organisms to mix in with those native to that planet. 

This doesn’t necessarily mean tinkering with humans themselves, we might be able to make microorganisms we can introduce into our guts to helps us digest the food, but tinkering with humans themselves is on the table for today. 

So, obviously, is the ethical issue attached to that. 

Gene Tailoring is a bit different, it has no formal definition but it comes with an assumption you are making unnatural changes to an organism. 

It would not just be replacing a defective gene in a person with the one of the other existing versions of it in other people but probably making up a new gene from scratch, which is where DNA printing comes in. 

So for instance, color blindness tends to be hereditary and red-green color blindness, which affects a pretty large chunk of the male populace, could be fixed by taking the functional gene from someone without color blindness and sticking it in the color blind person. 

This is controversial but not nearly as much so as the idea of taking some genes that let you develop cones in your eyes able to infrared light and putting them into a person. 

Either adapted from some other critter or cooking them up in a lab from scratch, or just on a computer model and printing them. 

So for the purpose of this video, when I say Bioforming I am talking about altering an organism to exist in some new environment, rather than altering the environment, though you could do both. 

When I saw gene tailoring I am talking about alterations to people through genetics beyond the basic form. 

So not so much replacing a defective gene which causes diabetes or near-sightedness, and more about giving yourself a body that can win Olympic medals without practice or eyes that can see infrared radiation or getting wings grafted on to your body or a becoming a horse from the torso down. 

This also includes the mental aspects, improving or altering the brain or nervous system, as opposed to just fixing problems like Dementia or Alzheimer's or my own more benign neurological condition that makes my hands tremble and face twitch but otherwise leaves me sound in mind and body. 

It would be nice if we could snip out the defective genes causing that sort of thing and by and large those are not considered particularly controversial. 

There are folks who think even doing things like that is going too far, but too be fair there are people whose definition of natural would seem to exclude anything more advanced than sharp sticks and fire. 

I’m never entirely clear why I often encounter these people on the internet, but I think maybe smartphones and tablets are exempted from their worldview of evil technology. 

Of course that itself is a good example of bias since I am well aware that various primitivist approaches have wildly different technologies they disapprove of and reasons for doing so. 

For some it is simply about self-reliance and personal challenge, and it isn’t like we mock mountain climbers for not taking a helicopter to the mountain peak. 

We will be discussing the ethics of this stuff and trying for some neutrality, and indeed there are a lot of strong arguments against some applications of this sort of technology and a lot of others types too, but there is also a line between reasonable concerns and the ridiculous. 

I can easily respect the opinion of someone who thinks engineering people for higher intelligence is dangerous, but while can respect a person who believes we should not use unnatural chemicals as medicine, in favor of all-natural approaches, I cannot respect their view on the matter. 

Simply their right to have that view and their right to expect courtesy equal to what they offer me. 

It’s a hazy line but I will try to keep on the proper side of it for today. 

So let us talk about methods, and again I want to keep this fairly brief. 

I outlined four a few minutes ago. 

CRISPR, retroviruses, DNA printing, and Universal Assemblers. 

Those are just some of the methods and I wanted to touch on certain aspects of each before we move on. 

CRISPR has become a big news item and you can get details about how it works elsewhere, but essentially a CRISPR is a chunk of DNA where you get a repeating pattern, the pattern is the same forwards and backwards and is short, twenty to forty base pairs, essentially a sentence long snippet in the bookshelf that is your DNA. 

That sentence keeps repeating but in between it are short bits, the equivalent of single words, called Spacer DNA, and those don’t repeat, each one is different and it looks like they are essentially identifiers for pesky viruses and such your body has encountered before. 

When it encounters new ones it lays in another segment, a new bit of Spacer DNA and another repetition of that sentence. 

That’s CRISPR. 

But nearby that segment is an associated sequence, a CRISPR Associated or Cas gene. 

These basically can unzip DNA and cut it up, and are a major part of our immune system. 

What make it handy for genetics is that we can take the Cas and attach something else to it, a sentence of our choosing. 

And if we stuck it in a cell it would go find anything that looked like that and can add or delete it. 

So the CRISPR/Cas-9 stuff you keep hearing about is essentially hijacking an existing part of us, one that prevents viruses from hijacking our cells, and using it to snip out bad DNA. 

And it shows amazing promise as a tool to be used to let us cut out or add or modify DNA. 

Before this the popular talk was often of retroviruses. 

In most viruses DNA is transcribed into RNA, then translated into proteins. 

Retroviruses do that somewhat backward, their RNA gets transcribed into the host’s DNA which starts making copies. 

Like CRISPR we have the option of hijacking this to be used to modify DNA. 

Of course you could get into someone’s DNA with very tiny forceps and scalpels and change it. 

The problem is that for any case where you are not working on a single cell embryo, like an adult human with trillions of cells, it is kind of hard to get at all those trillions of DNA helixes and alter each and everyone one. 

DNA printing, which is just spitting out the chemicals that make up DNA one molecule at a time in the right sequence, is obviously handy for letting us make one copy of DNA, we can make anything our minds can imagine and which is chemically possible. 

The problem, besides us needing a way to deliver changes to trillions of cells, is that DNA is very long. 

And while we always show DNA as a pair of long strands, it generally is like a big ball of yarn, not like a long wire hanging between two transmission towers. 

It’s got something like 3 billion base pairs for a human, and genes usually are made up several thousands base pairs and you’ve got several thousand genes in your DNA. 

A normal ball of yarn might be a few hundred meters long, a few times longer than a football field, but our DNA yarn ball, if it were normal yarn width, would be thousands of kilometers long. 

An individual gene would often be as long as a football field. 

When the whole thing wraps up in a ball it would be about your size. 

Needless to say printing something out, one hairbreadth at a time but thousands of kilometers long is pretty time consuming. 

So DNA printing is awesome for making one segment, one gene, or even one complete set of DNA, but not for mass manufacturing billions and trillions of copies for every cell in a body. 

That’s what CRISPR, retroviruses, and some other techniques are for. 

What is cool about DNA printing is you do not need an existing gene, you can design one from scratch, so we do not have to find fossilized DNA from a dinosaur to make one, we can just make educated guesses about what it needs and compile it from scratch on computer. 

We can then print it, stuff it into an egg, and proceed. 

And if we like we can give them a temperament and intelligence more in line with, say, a horse. 

Of course that is essentially turning DNA and RNA and viruses into machines, which they already are but I mean in the artificial sense. 

We can potentially skip that by using the sorts of tiny little nanomachines we have talked about before, particularly the kind called a Universal Assembler, or specifically the Universal Molecular Assembler. 

Which you can tell to build a copy of itself or tell to go find a bit of DNA and cut it up and assemble it how you want. 

Now my main reason for mentioning this one is that I like to remind people that we do not have to use and either or approach with technology. 

Fiction likes to show us futures where people are genetically engineered supermen or cyborgs, not both. 

They tend to skip that such critters would probably be both, even from birth. 

Same as we have mitochondria in us that is effectively an alien organism present in every cell in your body, you could have machine DNA equivalents that hung around doing jobs like replacing an organism's bones with hollow titanium or growing the various brain implants contemplated in Transhumanism. 

There are no unicorns, or at least I’ve never seen one or met anyone who has, at least while sober, but a horse with a horn on it is not exactly a weird thing that could never evolve naturally. 

Horns are handy and common features in nature so there probably is some planet somewhere that’s got them. 

Alternatively something like a dragon, I mean a giant flying reptile that weighs more than elephant and breathes fire, well that is not too likely. 

Dragons are also awesome so science fiction is full of plenty of examples of them where the author spends a lot of time fudging around with how they could exist with some gene-tailoring. 

Maybe so, but they can certainly exist if you do not mind going a bit above and beyond genetic engineering to include either DNA that can make little machines too, or symbiotic passengers like mitochondria. 

So your dragon is otherwise organic but it’s got hollow bones made of titanium or kevlar or graphene and maybe its wings and scales incorporate those features to make it very strong and light. 

Maybe you include a photosynthetic element on the wings so it can feed itself partly on sunlight when it stretches out to subathe on the noon-time desert sands. 

There’s no rule that says a genetically engineered plant could not suck metals out of the ground and weave them into its own structure to make it sturdier than what cellulose and lignin permit. 

Maybe it is incorporated into their core structure or maybe they deposit it like coral into a long spire they grow up around. 

So you can modify the existing organism or make one up from scratch, and a lot of time you will need to modify the brain for many of things I’ll mention in a moment too, you cannot just give someone cones in their eyeballs that are sensitive to infrared and ultraviolet light and expect them to see new colors beyond the rainbow, you need to get in the brain and do some re-wiring too. 

Uplifting, the name for when you take an animal and give it a human-level intelligence, tends to assume the reverse case. 

For better eyes that can see additional colors we need to tinker with the brain also, but for a better mind on a cat or dog or dolphin we might need to tinker with the physical form too. 

Giving them different vocal cords or more nimble toes that can grasp tools. 

Probably tinkering with its reproductive system too since a lot of animals reproduce much more quickly than us and with intelligence and tool use comes a much lower chance of natural death. 

Not what we usually mean these days as a euphemism for old age. 

In nature a natural death usually means ending as someone’s dinner and before you’ve reproduced, which you can do much younger than humans can which is important since humans live a long time and take a long time to develop during which we need a lot more parental care and attention. 

So if you are uplifting animals to make them sentient and sapient you probably need to be thinking about a lot of other things you need to accompany with that. 

Like longer lives, tool using hands, slower reproductive rates with single births not litters, and slower maturation rates. 

So you can use it to make your pets smarter or maybe make entirely new pets like that cute critter from the old gremlins movie, or real life pokemon. 

Now, what people might do to themselves doesn’t interest me all that much except in terms of pondering the ethics. 

I honestly do not much care if someone wants to get their body tweaked, genetically or cybernetically, so they are ten feet tall and built like a linebacker with a souped up heart to support all that new mass. 

Needless to say it could be used to let people switch genders or be both genders or neither. 

Or if they feel like getting scales or fur or feathers or a third eye or extra pair of arms. 

That could look pretty awesome or scary or disgusting, but again it is Halloween when this episode comes out so I’m content with scary. 

What does interest me is useful applications, a type of corn that can use more light to grow with for instance. 

Our plants mostly use red light for photosynthesis and don’t use much green or infrared, and most of what the sun emits is infrared light, and most stars in the galaxy emit even more of their light in that part of the spectrum. 

Our yellow ‘dwarf’ star out masses about 95% of stars and is hotter than them, meaning that it produces much more of its light in the visible range than they do. 

Needless to say a little tweak that let plants use that spectrum for growth could hugely increase the biomass on a planet or make terraforming planets around other stars much easier. 

It would be pretty neat to be able to tinker with how plants deal with carbon and carbon dioxide to be able to use it to sequester carbon out of the atmosphere. 

The strongest materials we have now are made out of carbon so it would be nice to suck the excess out of the air and maybe put it to use making those. 

It would also be neat to have plants that could be planted on toxic soil full of heavy metals and not only thrive but maybe have fruits that grew on them full of those metals, so we could collect them for reuse or safe disposal. 

We cold have vats of black algae that used the entire spectrum to grow very quickly and could be turned into biofuel or plastics, algae is already very promising in this regard but one tailored to use every ounce of energy it got shined on it would be even better. 

Trees that grew meat… sounds kind of freaky, but if it’s identical to bacon in taste and chemistry, it’s nicer than killing a pig, I’d say. 

So you could make a cow that produced more milk, which we’ve been doing through selective breeding for centuries, or you could cut out the middleman and have a bunch of bacteria that just grew milk. 

And since apparently almost everything tastes like chicken I’d imagine we could find a recipe for growing that too, we have been making pretty good strides in lab grown meat after all. 

So plants that could produce their own fertilizers, plants that can maybe suck the trace amounts of valuable minerals out regular soil and concentrate it for you, essentially plants that can be used as machines for specific purposes, in this case mining. 

You might be able to grow computers, you might be able to have organic structures that grew according to blueprint and repaired themselves. 

You might be able to grow solar panels as plants. 

Maybe you could make roads that repaired themselves too, with some equivalent to how coral reefs work or critters that grow shells. 

Maybe you don’t need vats of algae growing biofuel but can have a tree that you can tap for ethanol like we do for maple syrup. 

Maybe you can make an organism that will actually grow plastic, shiny transparent plastic, in some nice dome form that you can use for greenhouses in the desert or domes on Mars. 

Plants designed to live in toxic atmospheres or ones to dense or thin for life or ones designed from the ground up to live in the vacuum of space. 

You could potential create entire ecosphere in a solar system. 

Maybe ones that could migrate between solar systems and seed whole galaxies. 

Lots of random ideas tossed out there, some probably are absurd, some others probably are not but sound that way. 

Just some imagination fuel, when this topic got suggested it came attached with the request to offer out every crazy idea we might use it for and I think I just nailed that. 

These are potential options for genetic engineering when you open the doors to full blown gene tailoring, especially if you are not just limiting yourself to the strictly organic. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so we’ve explored the basics of why and how, and we have talked about both some of the useful things we are doing now or might do soon, and a lot of quite zany ideas too. 

So I suppose we ought to raise the ethical issues at last. 

When I started thinking about the ethical aspects though, trying to lay out the arguments for and against, two common themes struck me. 

The first was that almost all of them are not limited to just genetic engineering. 

For instance the ethics of using gene tailoring to enhance human intelligence or strength or endurance is essentially the same as those for using cybernetics to do it or performance enhancing drugs. 

The second is that these were not new arguments. 

We have been using rituals and herbs to try to make people healthier or smarter since long before we had science, and we have been using selective breeding of plants, animals, and even people for a quite long time. 

That science and technology make these things easier, and actually works, is irrelevant. 

Or it would seem so to me. 

In the past we have tried to do these things. 

Sometimes it didn’t work, even if maybe we thought it did, like many of our folk remedies or superstitions, sometimes it did work but imperfectly, also like many of our folk remedies and superstitions. 

Whether it worked or how well it worked does not change the ethics of doing it, for the same reason trying to murder someone with a stage prop sword and failing is still attempted murder. 

So we can say it is unethical to modify children so they grow up to be geniuses with the bodies of supermodels and professional athletes. 

We can say that it is doubly so because it pressures other people to do it to their own children. 

For that matter, what right do we have to modify a person without their informed consent? 

A thing which is impossible with a young child. 

And yet, we already do these things, and have for a long time. 

This does not make it ethical, we do a lot of things we probably should cease doing for ethical reasons and we certainly have tons of things we used to do and stopped doing because they were unethical. 

And yet we can frame many of the ethical issues of genetic engineering in the context of existing ethical issues. 

Throughout history we had tons of cultures that engaged in selective breeding for traits, and they knew they were doing it. 

People often do make decisions for their children, someone has to, and often those are not ones we would applaud. 

People already do feel pressured to do things to benefit their children which are questionable and do try to do things to give their child an edge, or to make sure they can keep up with the others. 

The line between encouraging your child to succeed and pressuring your child to do so is decidedly thin and ill-defined. 

Is it ethical to alter DNA? 

I don’t know but we’ve been doing it, deliberately, for generations, and the only difference is we did not know what DNA was. 

Is it ethical to alter someone’s DNA without their consent? 

I don’t know but it seems to me that it is akin to any other situation where you would act without the target’s consent. 

It may be wrong to force someone to have surgery to remove a brain tumor, even though it is clearly damaging their judgement and ability to make informed decisions. 

But if that is not unethical, why would it be so to give gene therapy to correct a similar ailment, like Dementia? 

Similarly, if is okay for people to refuse medical treatments for their children, then it would be for gene therapy too, I should think, and vice-versa if a parent can refuse a life-saving procedure for their child like a donated heart, then they can also refuse the gene therapy which might fix the defect. 

If we cannot ban such things as organ donation, then on what basis would we ban the gene therapy equivalent? 

If we can ban performancing enhancing drugs, can we ban performance enhancing genes, and what is the difference between the two which might make one bad but the other not? 

It may be unethical to tamper with the genes of plants and animals, yet we have done this for a long time too and typically not with that organism's best interest in mind but our own. 

I cannot say I always approve of such things, but regardless, be they right or wrong, they seem little different than intentional genetic alteration, except, again, that we are much more skilled at it doing it. 

And when it comes to bioforming, altering organisms to live in alien environments, I am not sure what the difference is between altering a dog to live on the Planet Dune where it never rains, and altering the local wildlife to adapt to it raining, but it seems no more or less ethical to do that then to wipe out the giant desert sandworms that dwell there and are killed by water or to tinker with them so they can now live in oceans not just the seas of sand. 

So, as is often the case when we talk about the ethics of this or that bit of technology on this channel, we do not come up with a yes or no, but we maybe come away with a clearer picture of what we should be considering. 

I suspect almost every aspect of genetic engineering will have its own case-by-case problems. 

So some food for thought, and I’d be curious to hear what you think about these matters in the comments section of the episode, or over on the Facebook or Reddit Groups, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, which are often more conducive to discussion if you want to talk with others about the ideas we looked at today. 

Next week is going to be my collaboration episode with Joe Scott, where we will look at Dark Flow &amp; the Great Attractor. 

The week after that will be the Stellar Compendium, where we are going to look at the big zoo of star types, including the strange ones, and demystify some of the terms used to discuss them.

The Kardashev Scale (Narration Only)

2016-10-21

So today’s topic, the Kardashev Scale, is a familiar one for channel regulars. 

We have talked about it before in passing a few times but we have never actually focused down on it and discussed the implications of what it means, what sort of abilities civilizations with it would have, or what sort of flaws it has as a scale. 

This episode can also be viewed as either a culmination or summary episode of a lot of the other episodes or as an introduction to them, as we have discussed a lot of the individual abilities of these kind of civilizations before. 

So I am going to be referencing previous episodes a lot. 

If this is your first time to the channel you might want more detail and can go to those episodes for them, and you probably also want to turn on the closed captions. 

We might as well start with the basics, back in 1964 astronomer Nikolai Kardashev created a clever scale for identifying the size of civilizations. 

Unfortunately, it only has three official steps, planetary, solar, and galactic. 

This is kind of like have three sizes of drinks, where you’ve got large, extra-large, and gigantic, and to make it worse if the large size was a one liter cup, the extra-large would be an Olympic Swimming Pool, and the gigantic is the Earth’s oceans. 

This is a bit of an awkward scale to use if you want to describe a tablespoon sized civilization or maybe a bathtub sized one. 

The other issue is that it goes strictly off available power, which isn’t bad if you have to pick one thing to use, but is not really ideal either. 

After all a modern computer can walk all over something like ENIAC from back in the days when vacuum tubes were state of the art technology and a modern one uses much less power. 

So too, the post-stellar civilizations we discussed in the Black Hole Farming video run on so little power they make a Double-A battery look like the Hoover Dam, and yet they would regard even the biggest civilization we will discuss today as tiny newcomers. 

Kardashev wanted a quick and simple system and it caught on. 

So we are kind of stuck with it now. 

I doubt he expected it to go into common usage or he likely would have scaled it better. 

I will link the English translation of the original 1964 paper, “Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations”, in the episode description, but it will put context on why it seems like I am being critical of the scale but not of Kardashev himself. 

The scale itself is a quick aside to give a general notion what we ought to be looking for when looking for alien civilizations. 

He does not even care about our own, which does not even make it onto the scale as a Type I civilization, let alone anything pre-technological. 

Now the three types he outlines, types 1, 2, and 3, are defined by how much power they have access too. 

A Type I has access to an energy budget equal to a whole planet, a Type II a whole star, and a type III a whole galaxy. 

Humanity would not yet be a Type I. 

Though a planet sprawling super-city like we discussed in Ecumenopolises Episode would be. 

A Type II would be a full on Dyson Sphere or Dyson Swarm which we have talked about in many episodes, but as a reminder it is a collection of power collectors or artificial habitats around a star that absorb most of its light, though it is often portrayed as a big shell. 

Type III is not a galaxy-spanning civilization as most tend to think, where people inhabit most of the decent planets around most yellow stars. 

That might sound bigger than a Dyson Swarm, a Type II, but in fact a Type II, or K2 civilization, one with a Dyson Swarm, would flat out smash such a galactic empire. 

A Type III, or K3 civilization, is one where every single star has been turned into a Dyson Swarm. 

Lots of folks have proposed minor alterations to the Kardashev Scale, or whole new scales, but I think Carl Sagan had the best modification that keeps it as basically the same scale, but a bit more useful. 

He basically just tweaked it to follow a better order of magnitude scale, nice even tens. 

So in Sagan’s a civilization with access to about a Megawatt of power, or 10^6 Watts is a Type-0, a Type-1 one would be 10^16 Watts, a bit less than Earth gets, a Type-2 would be 10^26 Watts, which is pretty close to our sun’s output, and a Type-3 would be 10^36 Watts, a bit less than the Milky Way’s output. 

This is a lot better, because it means you can just take the exponent of 10 to the whatever, subtract 6 and divide by ten and have a nice smooth scale. 

It’s not quite as smooth and intuitive as I’d prefer, but it holds to the basic Kardashev scale and is a lot easier to work with in-between states. 

In the Sagan modified version a classic Kardashev 1 would actually be a 1.1, but K2 and K3 would remain a K2.0 and 3.0, and now we can scale smoothly to any size, so I will use that the rest of the episode. 

I should also note that while planets and galaxies vary in size quite a lot, stars vary even more hugely, from ones that are millions of times more powerful than our star to ones less than a ten-thousandth as powerful. 

That’s ten whole orders of magnitude, an entire level on our scale. 

And possibly excluding the very brightest and shortest lived stars, you would want to build a Dyson swarm around any star. 

It is not like planets, where those you might terraform to be Earth-like will all be within an order of magnitude or so, and even galaxies do not vary that much in size. 

Now as I mentioned, energy access does not necessarily tell you much about the technology or population of a civilization, but we also have to decide what we mean by energy access. 

Current world power consumption is about 12 terawatts, or about 10^13 watts, which would match up on our Sagan modified Kardashev Scale as a 0.7 civilization. 

We would be a Type 0.7, or K.7. 

But we use a lot more power than that in truth, arguably the whole planet, since our food crops use a lot of energy, way more than we do. 

Once you get past the K1 stage that sunlight energy for plants starts to be something you have to pay for, either by creating it in fusion reactors or building habitats in space exposed to sunlight. 

In that regard we would already qualify as a full blown K1.0 civ, or close to it. 

Of course viewed that way we have been pretty close to that for a long time. 

Alternatively a K0 civilization ought to have about a megawatt of power, which in more classic terms is 1300 Horsepower. 

Or in more humans terms, about 10,000 people-power. 

I find that an appropriate number, since the term civilization originally referred to living in cities, and those do not emerge until you start having thousands of people bonded together a bit more interdependently then even loose associations of multiple tribes that hunter-gatherers often had. 

This is also when you can start having machines more complex than very simple one that just amplify or focus human strength, like the level or wedge or axe. 

So I would say the dawn of history would be when we reached K0 The Scale is inevitably arbitrary in many respects, after all if I included all the energy used by a hunter-gather civilization, to include the sunlight used to grow the plants which produced the nuts and berries they gathered and the fed the animals they hunt, an individual person requires very nearly a gigawatt to survive. 

While that same land and sunlight could support a hundred times as many people with fairly unsophisticated farming techniques. 

One would think the latter civilization ought to be much higher on the scale. 

Similarly those of you who recall the Ecumenopolises or Matrioshka Brains episodes would see how these would also presumably rank much higher than the usual K1 or K2 civilizations they would be compared to. 

These energy levels tell us nothing about technology, again the scale was meant for civilizations past where we are now. 

But higher states doesn’t imply more technology, except insofar as you would expect that to get to those higher places on the scale you had to be around for quite a while with a very large population, meaning you have a ton of researchers who have been working for a very long time. 

Of course technology might just come to a halt, we cannot assume we can always just discover new things. 

You do not need much more technology than we have now thought to colonize the galaxy. 

We have discussed before how we basically only need fusion, and maybe not even that, to colonize the entire galaxy. 

So while we can at least say no one is getting themselves onto the classic Kardashev Scale without roughly modern technology, we cannot assume any technology beyond that. 

With that in mind, we will be looking at scenarios where the only new tech of significance ever invented are just those we might call near horizon, not necessarily guaranteed but in that zone where most scientists would say ‘yes, that’s quite likely’ and few if any would say ‘no, that is probably impossible’ or ‘I would not even know where to start’. 

And be it K1, K2, K3, or even higher, we figure they have not discovered one new big thing. 

None of us think that will be the case, but as we discuss some of the awesome things K2 and K3 civilizations can do, just using technology we have now or nearly do, just remember how much more majestic they would be with those. 

As we will see, they are pretty awe-inspiring without them too. 

Now even the modified Kardashev Scale, which is way better at doing increments, is not that great at providing scale. 

In some way it easier to think of it as a population scale, and the Sagan-modified one is pretty decent for that since you can just remove the decimal place and treat that as the order of magnitude. 

A 1.0 is 10^10, or 10 billion people, a 2.0 is 10^20, or 100 billion-billion people, a 3.0 is 10^30 or a million-trillion-trillion people, and the in-betweens increments will work pretty well too. 

As we have also discussed before, while delaing with people who are basically human in their biological needs, a megawatt of power is a pretty generous power budget per person even when you need to supply the sunlight for your food too. 

It’s not perfect but it gives a decent zone that is about right. 

If we assume a classic K1 civilization, one with the full output of all the energy that hits their planet, you would probably wonder where one that had terraformed all the other rocky planets and moons in the solar system would be. 

You might be disappointed that it was only a 1.1 or 1.2. 

It goes up in orders of magnitude after all. 

Something like the Federation from Star Trek might make it in as a 1.3, Isaac Asimov’s Empire from the Foundation series of tens of millions of worlds a 1.7. 

And a galactic empire of billion of planets would just manage to make it in as a K2 civilization. 

A whole sprawling galactic empire just barely manages to match one lone Dyson sphere in scale and power. 

Yet as we have discussed many times on this channel, a star encompassing Dyson Sphere, the thing which defines a K2 civilization, is not super-advanced technology that only some ancient high-tech civilization sprawling over thousands of solar systems might build. 

Quite to the contrary you would probably have started construction before the first interstellar colony ships left on their long voyages. 

I imagine you would get better at building it as your technology improved but you do not actually need to have that improvement. 

So what can a K2 do? 

We have talked about some of their abilities before. 

They can move their own star, albeit slowly, by means of the Shkadov Thruster we discussed in megastructures episode 8 and which is an innate ability of any Dyson Sphere. 

It can flat out blow up any planet in the galaxy, as good as the Death Star from Star Wars, either by use of giant laser beam or more likely laser propelled relativistic kill missiles, RKMs, that we discussed in episode 9. 

It can send those out one after another destroying planet after planet and even arrange for them to hit all at the same time. 

It is civilization that regards building a death star sized object as a minor expense. 

It also is not one that has any shortage of construction material. 

We talked about that a couple weeks ago in the Starlifting episode. 

They also have no shortage of labor to use to construct stuff with even if they haven’t got the kind of super-automation we discussed in the self-replicating machines episode. 

A K2 civilization would outnumber us by at least a billion to one. 

For every citizen we have on Earth they have an entire Earth’s worth of population. 

Even with no other major new technology to their advantage they simply would dwarf us like an elephant next to ant. 

They would presumably have better tech too since where we have hundreds of thousands of researchers they would have hundreds of trillions. 

I have mentioned before, in regard to the Fermi Paradox, that no civilization would bother hiding themselves since once they have sent out those first radio waves the cat is out of the bag. 

I have also mentioned that interstellar empires do not need to wait till a world has discovered radio to detect them. 

This is why, because while we employ thousands of professional astronomers, a K2 civilization could as easily employ trillions. 

Enough to employ more than one person to constantly watch every single star in the galaxy. 

And you could build telescopes much bigger, and also much cheaper, when you already have an industrial base in space. 

They could build a trillion telescopes, each of which made the Hubble telescope look like a toy, each aimed at a solar system constantly and manned. 

This does not even include that they can send ships to all those places too. 

In the star lifting episode we saw that a civilization could pull thousands of Earth’s worth of metal out of their own sun, but even one-thousandth of an Earth’s worth of building material would be enough to build an aircraft carrier mass spaceship 100 trillion times over again. 

Enough to send whole fleets to every single star in the galaxy without making a tiny pinprick in your available construction mass. 

And they can man every single one of those fleets with millions of crew members too. 

Not that you need to send giant armies out to invade other solar systems hundreds of light years away since you can breed your invasion force during the long trip. 

Colonizing the galaxy is obviously not a big problem for them. 

Whether they leap frog from star to star or just settle everything directly from their home system doesn’t much matter. 

They can get out and colonize the galaxy and turn every single star into another Dyson Sphere. 

This is where fiction just breaks down. 

Authors rarely seem to try to tackle a K2 civilization let alone a K3. 

I am not sure if the scale just blows their mind, it certainly blows mine, or if they think the audience just won’t be able get into any story that is set on that kind of scale. 

It’s hard to write about a battle with one when it could dump a billion soldiers on a planet as an invasion force and regard that like sending in a single small squad of advance troops. 

Or that, even if they were quite peaceful, they could have the equivalents to Arlington National Cemetery that could sprawl over entire planet sized areas as labyrinthine necropolises. 

Of course a K2 might be a biologically immortal one, we talked about that option in the Transhumanism video, but if it weren’t, if they were just like us, then they’d have several billion people being born and dying every single second. 

I wouldn’t expect they would bury them all in the same place, or even to necessarily bury them at all, but using the typical 50 square foot burial plotyou would fill up several thousand square miles in a second and have the entire North American continent as nothing but head stones in every direction inside an hour. 

You’d be able to layer the entire planet with corpses every day, and a new one each day. 

Of course there’s no reason you would bury everyone in the same place, and indeed I do not want to imply a K2 would be some unified civilization. 

The thing about a classic Dyson swarm, say one made of rotating habitats in the O’neill Cylinder range, which has about a sixth of land area of Long Island in New York, is that you would need trillions of these things each home to around a million or more people. 

Or less if it was a dedicated nature preserve or something. 

That’s another ability of K2 civilizations, they could devote a tiny portion of their energy budget to nature preserve habitats and have thousands of planet’s worth of habitats just for critters. 

A K2 has over a billion times the living area we do, and you can make habitats on par with large islands or places like Yosemite National Park without needing any super-strong materials and you could make billions of those without them being even a percent of your space, because you have trillions of those kind of habitats. 

Yet in spite of that, when formed up as a Dyson Swarm, they would not be any nearer to each other than a few thousand miles or kilometers. 

Space is big, and a Dyson Swarm is not a 2D flat shell, it can be tens of millions of kilometers thick. 

It’s a foggy cloud not a shell. 

Each of those habitats is basically its own nation-state and if it is orbiting as part of a ring then it only has two permanent neighbors, the one before and the one after it in their orbit around the Sun. 

These are very self-sufficient constructs and it probably could not even be blockaded from the sun’s light since it likely would have a backup fusion reactor or something, and if it did they could have billions of years’ worth of fuel stored up on hand, and they can pretty much recycle everything else. 

Trying to besiege one might be a process of several million years if you are not willing to actually attack it, just embargo it. 

You can certainly blow up an O’neill cylinder, but trying to invade and occupy one would be a nightmare with essentially only two skinny openings to come through. 

So you have a setup that trends toward a lot of autonomy, since once built, especially if they do have fusion technology, they do not need new shipments of material or fusion fuel more often than on huge timelines and you are pretty much limited to telling anyone who feels like being isolationist to do as you tell them or you will kill all of them. 

Which is not as good a negotiating position as it sounds like. 

You have got ‘we will cut off your internet’ and ‘we will blow up your habitat’ as your diplomatic arsenal. 

Presumably you would end up with at least a lot of leagues of associated habitats who had at least a loose set of rules you had to follow to stay in that group. 

It could be a lot more unified than that too, but that is the caveat on the sheer scale of these civilizations because there is no obvious means of compelling unified action short of outright blowing up habitats. 

Don’t expect that to result in inaction though, we have never had a single unified planetary government and we still get a lot done, and that has been the case for countries with very autonomous subdivisions or very unified ones too. 

A billion colony ships launched by a tiny sliver of a K2 instead of hundreds of trillions is still pretty effective at colonizing a galaxy. 

Any individual habitat ought to be quite capable of building an interstellar ark all on its own too, or people from all over could crowdsource them. 

But it is another good reminder of scale, you could have entire religions or political parties kicking around a K2 whose numbers dwarfed even our biggest modern ones that could get regarded as a tiny little cult. 

I was joking after I made the megastructures videos on Discworlds and Hoopworlds that they are indeed very impractical but I figure someone would still build one. 

They are quite impractical but you could crowdsource construction of something like that in a K2 civilization just off the tiny percent of the population who thought it was amusing enough to chip in the equivalent of ten bucks to the fund it. 

They could do the same for whole fleets of colonizing vessels. 

I keep coming back to scale on this because it is what always gets missed in contemplating it. 

I think the mind shudders back from the concept of a K2 civilization, something we might easily be in under a thousand years, because that scale is just so overwhelming. 

It is a civilization in which a band most people have never heard of could fill a planet with their audience and have them packed in as tightly as a mosh pit. 

It is one where the heat energy released by everyone watching a primetime TV show, if released on the Earth, would incinerate every living creature on land. 

Going to war with such a civilization, even if you did not have a technological edge, would not be comparable to the United States fighting a small country like Malta, it would be like the entire NATO alliance picked a fight with a single kindergartener. 

There’s no point trying to hide from such a thing, especially because a classic K2 civilization is not a real one anyway, since they have means to engage in robust colonization of other solar systems long before they reach full K2 status. 

It does not matter what other technology you might have, once you have a basic Dyson Sphere partially built, even just a percent of a percent of percent, you get access to all the energy you need for Interstellar travel. 

We have talked about that before, even if you never get fusion and never get cool things like kugelblitz black holes to drive your starships, you can shove even large ships up to relativistic speeds using nothing more than modern technology and a ton of power. 

Slamming trillions of watts of laser into the back of a spaceship is not the image of space travel we normally have, it is a very brute force technique, but it gets the job done. 

And as I pointed out in the Interstellar Colonization episode, you would also expect them to be settling all those frozen rocks and rogue planets that hang out between solar systems. 

Not to mention colonizing your own outer solar system which we will have an episode on soon. 

So even as that Dyson Sphere is getting built ever more completely, slowly adding more and more objects to the swarm, your outer solar system is getting colonized, your Oort Cloud and every frozen rock in it is being made someone’s home, and all those stars nearby you are getting colonized too. 

And I mean all of them. 

There might be a marked preference for Yellow Suns with Earth-sized planets that have liquid water but when you get to the point that most of your population was not even born on Earth, but in some rotating habitat, a nice ring of asteroids around some red dwarf looks quite appealing. 

Or even a dead white dwarf or a gas giant that’s out in the frozen void This does not even consider that those people might not be much like us, they might be transhuman cyborgs or outright digital people who live on microchips and only care about how many watts of energy they can get their hands on, not what color the sun is. 

Though of course every star is basically white regardless that we tend to call them yellow or orange or red. 

So I would tend to think that by the time most folks completed their first Dyson Sphere they would actually be 2.1 or 2.2. 

Even if 90% of the population lived back around their own sun they could easily have several thousand solar systems settled inside a century of the first ships leaving. 

The nearest star might be 4 light years away but space is three-dimensional, and there are over a thousand solar systems within 50 light years. 

And if you sent a million colonists to each one, they would fill up quite fast. 

People can double in a single generation, more actually, and even more if you have life extension technology good enough that folks are still having children when they are also having great-great-grandchildren. 

People mostly like children, we are kind of wired up to do so, and in a post-scarcity setup they aren’t a huge burden. 

Especially if you are some 400 year old Methuselah who has centuries of knowledge, experience, and accomplishments behind you, and still have all the vigor and hormones of 20 or 30 year old. 

Colonists to new solar systems have no reason not to increase their numbers and quite likely jumped on a ship for a long voyage partially for the ability to do so with impunity, or even applause. 

So you could see Dyson Spheres getting under way around those even before we finished our own while new systems are still being colonized further out way back from Earth and then they start getting underway. 

At the edge of new space you’d probably always have a shell of a few hundred light years of newly colonized systems at various degrees of expansion, around an iron core of Dyson Spheres. 

This would eventually absorb the entire galaxy into a genuine K3 civilization. 

The funny thing is that unless you actually have found some way to travel faster than light, or at least communicate faster than light, both of which are probably impossible, you never get a K3. 

I mentioned already in regard to K2 civilizations that the default setup, trillions of rotating habitats that seem packed together but in reality have a lower population density than earth, would probably tilt toward a lot of autonomy and local sovereignty. 

But there at least you do have the option to have common authority of some sort since you can threaten to just blow up habitats that misbehave too much and there is at least a minimal need to get along and make sure you have some basic rules for radio traffic and ships and habitats to move around. 

It is not much, but there is some minimal need for cooperation and some option to compel people to cooperate. 

Once you get into other solar systems there is just none. 

Yes the original solar system and later the core systems near it will probably have a strong headlock on technology and science and new art and entertainment. 

But it would be very hard to prevent anyone from getting their hands on it considering it would only take one infiltrator with a decent laser beam to send that information on to their rebellious home system. 

So to be honest I just don’t think anyone would try to maintain an interstellar empire. 

I don’t think you would see interstellar wars either. 

I can imagine hundreds of wars going on inside a K2, with armies and fleets that would make World War 2 look like a schoolyard brawl, though ironically even such conflicts might be considered minor squabbles inside an otherwise peaceful solar system. 

But interstellar ones, without faster than light travel, would almost have to be limited to squabbling over all those tiny icy rocks in between those solar systems which might best be regarded as rural villages of mighty metropolises. 

Space, again, is also 3-dimensional, so you have not got a few neighbors to pick a fight with, you have dozens. 

Now I could see interstellar organizations, or relative loose confederations with agreed on trade rules and currency, that sort of thing, but not what we would think of as an interstellar empire, maybe the occasional close union of a few hundred systems set against the backdrop of a few hundred billion colonized systems. 

So in that sense a K3 civilization, as a unified thing, is probably something that can never happen without some sort of workaround to the speed of light. 

As a caveat to this though we need to remember that there are quite a few places in the galaxy where stars are much closer together and in those you could get some genuine interstellar empires. 

Similar, from what you can do with Starlifitng and Shkadov Thrusters you could easily see fairly tightly packed artificially created pockets of red dwarf stars forming some sort of super Dyson. 

Or with fusion, no stars at all just a massive cloud of habitats packed in as tight as they can without cooking form their waste heat or collapsing in together under their collective gravity. 

You get this kind of swarms even if you have better sources of power than suns or fusion, like black holes or antimatter, because you want to be as close as you can to others for communication and the distances between objects in these swarms is already huge enough to satisfy privacy. 

The average distance between habitats is huge, and if that is not intuitive enough, the average distance between individual people if we scattered them evenly would be on an order or tens of miles or kilometers. 

So people are not spacing themselves out more for privacy, they’ve got it. 

They are doing it for waste heat and gravity. 

Closer together allows you to talk to people who are not in your habitat real time or with minimal light lag. 

Historically empires have often managed to keep things welded together even when it took routine communications months to get from point A to B and armies a year or more to travel. 

So if we were generous an and assume a 1-light year radius could hold together, and we contemplated that as a place where we just packed habitats in as much as we could without needing some new way to get rid of heat, that could actually be a few billion times more energetic than a classic Dyson sphere and that would be pretty close to a K3. 

I have no idea what to name something like that and I don’t feel like coining a term so if anyone can come up with one let me know in the comments. 

Some giant sprawl of habitats numbering in the billions of trillions, each running on their own fusion reactor in some giant light-year wide cloud bathed in infrared waste heat. 

Probably with quadrillions of ships flowing in to stop at each one every few thousand years to re-tank their fusion fuel from massive bunkers left over from using starlifting to cannibalize a thousand suns. 

Anyway, that’s about the only scenario I can see, if the speed of light remains a barrier, for anything like a unified K3 civilization, and that could stomp all over a K2 the way a K2 could stomp all over us. 

Now there really is not anything a K3 can do that a K2 could not do anyway. 

They would probably have way better technology but we already agreed not to use that as our standard. 

After all the Kardashev scale is entirely power based and a classic K3 would be a tiny slow pipsqueak compared to a single Matrioshka Brain, which is a K2 or maybe a K2.1 at best, But there is a long way between a K2 and a K3, and any number if 2.1 or 2.2 or 3 could engage in all sorts of projects like moving or making stars. 

I joked about a K2 crowdsourcing the construction of a discworld or hoopworld earlier, these could probably get away with crowdsourcing an Alderson Disc. 

Such civilizations can be moving and making Stars. 

They could be crowdsourcing bizarre megastructures like an entire star with a shell around it in the shape of face of a popular philosopher. 

Or they could be taking an example like the horsehead nebula and sculpting one to look like their favorite musician when viewed from their area of the galaxy. 

You can do some pretty extreme stuff at that level even if you are still running only on the sort of technology we can see ourselves developing in the next century or so. 

You can even start launching projects to go grab other galaxies that left to themselves would drift over the cosmological event horizon and drag them back. 

You can move galaxies as easily as stars, technology-wise anyway, obviously you have to scale things up a lot. 

Our own galaxy will stay locked to a handful nearby us even as the expansion of the Universe drags other galaxies away but you can get out to probably at least several thousand nearby galaxies and convert large chunks of them into Shkadov thrusters powerful enough to shove their galaxy our way fast enough to beat that out. 

Maybe a good deal more too. 

Even if you had to expend fully half that galaxy’s mass to get it back here and it would take a hundred billion years that might be worth it. 

This brings up the notion of civilizations beyond a K3, something Kardashev deliberately avoided defining as he viewed it as rather pointless. 

Even a civilization that had swarmed out over an entire Galactic Supercluster still would not meet the definition of a K4 using our open-ended Sagan modified form. 

And even a civilization which somehow had access to the entire mass of the Universe and could convert it into energy could still only operate as a K5 civilization, on with 10^56 Watts of power to work with, for a few million years. 

Civilizations at that scale can only be contemplated if you definitely have access to either faster than light travel or there is a multi-verse and you can access that. 

Or you have just learned to sneer at the Laws of Thermodynamics and genuinely do have the equivalent of a power strip that can run by plugging it into itself. 

I think we will wrap up on that note. 

As mentioned, we discuss a lot of these ideas more in other episodes and will probably have even more episodes on some of these topics in the future. 

By now you ought to have some feel for how immense these sorts of civilizations can be and why we could and will probably become one ourselves. 

This also wraps up closely with the Dyson Dilemma of the Fermi Paradox since it is contemplating what these sorts of civilizations can do and how likely they are that leads to the conclusion of the Dyson Dilemma that intelligent life must be exceedingly uncommon or we should see these everywhere by now. 

By the way I would like to thank Martin Rezny of Rezonance for providing the musical accompaniment for this episode.

The Kardashev Scale (Music Included)
---
  
2016-10-20

So today’s topic, the Kardashev Scale, is a familiar one for channel regulars. 

We have talked about it before in passing a few times but we have never actually focused down on it and discussed the implications of what it means, what sort of abilities civilizations with it would have, or what sort of flaws it has as a scale. 

This episode can also be viewed as either a culmination or summary episode of a lot of the other episodes or as an introduction to them, as we have discussed a lot of the individual abilities of these kind of civilizations before. 

So I am going to be referencing previous episodes a lot. 

If this is your first time to the channel you might want more detail and can go to those episodes for them, and you probably also want to turn on the closed captions. 

We might as well start with the basics, back in 1964 astronomer Nikolai Kardashev created a clever scale for identifying the size of civilizations. 

Unfortunately, it only has three official steps, planetary, solar, and galactic. 

This is kind of like have three sizes of drinks, where you’ve got large, extra-large, and gigantic, and to make it worse if the large size was a one liter cup, the extra-large would be an Olympic Swimming Pool, and the gigantic is the Earth’s oceans. 

This is a bit of an awkward scale to use if you want to describe a tablespoon sized civilization or maybe a bathtub sized one. 

The other issue is that it goes strictly off available power, which isn’t bad if you have to pick one thing to use, but is not really ideal either. 

After all a modern computer can walk all over something like ENIAC from back in the days when vacuum tubes were state of the art technology and a modern one uses much less power. 

So too, the post-stellar civilizations we discussed in the Black Hole Farming video run on so little power they make a Double-A battery look like the Hoover Dam, and yet they would regard even the biggest civilization we will discuss today as tiny newcomers. 

Kardashev wanted a quick and simple system and it caught on. 

So we are kind of stuck with it now. 

I doubt he expected it to go into common usage or he likely would have scaled it better. 

I will link the English translation of the original 1964 paper, “Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations”, in the episode description, but it will put context on why it seems like I am being critical of the scale but not of Kardashev himself. 

The scale itself is a quick aside to give a general notion what we ought to be looking for when looking for alien civilizations. 

He does not even care about our own, which does not even make it onto the scale as a Type I civilization, let alone anything pre-technological. 

Now the three types he outlines, types 1, 2, and 3, are defined by how much power they have access too. 

A Type I has access to an energy budget equal to a whole planet, a Type II a whole star, and a type III a whole galaxy. 

Humanity would not yet be a Type I. 

Though a planet sprawling super-city like we discussed in Ecumenopolises Episode would be. 

A Type II would be a full on Dyson Sphere or Dyson Swarm which we have talked about in many episodes, but as a reminder it is a collection of power collectors or artificial habitats around a star that absorb most of its light, though it is often portrayed as a big shell. 

Type III is not a galaxy-spanning civilization as most tend to think, where people inhabit most of the decent planets around most yellow stars. 

That might sound bigger than a Dyson Swarm, a Type II, but in fact a Type II, or K2 civilization, one with a Dyson Swarm, would flat out smash such a galactic empire. 

A Type III, or K3 civilization, is one where every single star has been turned into a Dyson Swarm. 

Lots of folks have proposed minor alterations to the Kardashev Scale, or whole new scales, but I think Carl Sagan had the best modification that keeps it as basically the same scale, but a bit more useful. 

He basically just tweaked it to follow a better order of magnitude scale, nice even tens. 

So in Sagan’s a civilization with access to about a Megawatt of power, or 10^6 Watts is a Type-0, a Type-1 one would be 10^16 Watts, a bit less than Earth gets, a Type-2 would be 10^26 Watts, which is pretty close to our sun’s output, and a Type-3 would be 10^36 Watts, a bit less than the Milky Way’s output. 

This is a lot better, because it means you can just take the exponent of 10 to the whatever, subtract 6 and divide by ten and have a nice smooth scale. 

It’s not quite as smooth and intuitive as I’d prefer, but it holds to the basic Kardashev scale and is a lot easier to work with in-between states. 

In the Sagan modified version a classic Kardashev 1 would actually be a 1.1, but K2 and K3 would remain a K2.0 and 3.0, and now we can scale smoothly to any size, so I will use that the rest of the episode. 

I should also note that while planets and galaxies vary in size quite a lot, stars vary even more hugely, from ones that are millions of times more powerful than our star to ones less than a ten-thousandth as powerful. 

That’s ten whole orders of magnitude, an entire level on our scale. 

And possibly excluding the very brightest and shortest lived stars, you would want to build a Dyson swarm around any star. 

It is not like planets, where those you might terraform to be Earth-like will all be within an order of magnitude or so, and even galaxies do not vary that much in size. 

Now as I mentioned, energy access does not necessarily tell you much about the technology or population of a civilization, but we also have to decide what we mean by energy access. 

Current world power consumption is about 12 terawatts, or about 10^13 watts, which would match up on our Sagan modified Kardashev Scale as a 0.7 civilization. 

We would be a Type 0.7, or K.7. 

But we use a lot more power than that in truth, arguably the whole planet, since our food crops use a lot of energy, way more than we do. 

Once you get past the K1 stage that sunlight energy for plants starts to be something you have to pay for, either by creating it in fusion reactors or building habitats in space exposed to sunlight. 

In that regard we would already qualify as a full blown K1.0 civ, or close to it. 

Of course viewed that way we have been pretty close to that for a long time. 

Alternatively a K0 civilization ought to have about a megawatt of power, which in more classic terms is 1300 Horsepower. 

Or in more humans terms, about 10,000 people-power. 

I find that an appropriate number, since the term civilization originally referred to living in cities, and those do not emerge until you start having thousands of people bonded together a bit more interdependently then even loose associations of multiple tribes that hunter-gatherers often had. 

This is also when you can start having machines more complex than very simple one that just amplify or focus human strength, like the level or wedge or axe. 

So I would say the dawn of history would be when we reached K0 The Scale is inevitably arbitrary in many respects, after all if I included all the energy used by a hunter-gather civilization, to include the sunlight used to grow the plants which produced the nuts and berries they gathered and the fed the animals they hunt, an individual person requires very nearly a gigawatt to survive. 

While that same land and sunlight could support a hundred times as many people with fairly unsophisticated farming techniques. 

One would think the latter civilization ought to be much higher on the scale. 

Similarly those of you who recall the Ecumenopolises or Matrioshka Brains episodes would see how these would also presumably rank much higher than the usual K1 or K2 civilizations they would be compared to. 

These energy levels tell us nothing about technology, again the scale was meant for civilizations past where we are now. 

But higher states doesn’t imply more technology, except insofar as you would expect that to get to those higher places on the scale you had to be around for quite a while with a very large population, meaning you have a ton of researchers who have been working for a very long time. 

Of course technology might just come to a halt, we cannot assume we can always just discover new things. 

You do not need much more technology than we have now thought to colonize the galaxy. 

We have discussed before how we basically only need fusion, and maybe not even that, to colonize the entire galaxy. 

So while we can at least say no one is getting themselves onto the classic Kardashev Scale without roughly modern technology, we cannot assume any technology beyond that. 

With that in mind, we will be looking at scenarios where the only new tech of significance ever invented are just those we might call near horizon, not necessarily guaranteed but in that zone where most scientists would say ‘yes, that’s quite likely’ and few if any would say ‘no, that is probably impossible’ or ‘I would not even know where to start’. 

And be it K1, K2, K3, or even higher, we figure they have not discovered one new big thing. 

None of us think that will be the case, but as we discuss some of the awesome things K2 and K3 civilizations can do, just using technology we have now or nearly do, just remember how much more majestic they would be with those. 

As we will see, they are pretty awe-inspiring without them too. 

Now even the modified Kardashev Scale, which is way better at doing increments, is not that great at providing scale. 

In some way it easier to think of it as a population scale, and the Sagan-modified one is pretty decent for that since you can just remove the decimal place and treat that as the order of magnitude. 

A 1.0 is 10^10, or 10 billion people, a 2.0 is 10^20, or 100 billion-billion people, a 3.0 is 10^30 or a million-trillion-trillion people, and the in-betweens increments will work pretty well too. 

As we have also discussed before, while delaing with people who are basically human in their biological needs, a megawatt of power is a pretty generous power budget per person even when you need to supply the sunlight for your food too. 

It’s not perfect but it gives a decent zone that is about right. 

If we assume a classic K1 civilization, one with the full output of all the energy that hits their planet, you would probably wonder where one that had terraformed all the other rocky planets and moons in the solar system would be. 

You might be disappointed that it was only a 1.1 or 1.2. 

It goes up in orders of magnitude after all. 

Something like the Federation from Star Trek might make it in as a 1.3, Isaac Asimov’s Empire from the Foundation series of tens of millions of worlds a 1.7. 

And a galactic empire of billion of planets would just manage to make it in as a K2 civilization. 

A whole sprawling galactic empire just barely manages to match one lone Dyson sphere in scale and power. 

Yet as we have discussed many times on this channel, a star encompassing Dyson Sphere, the thing which defines a K2 civilization, is not super-advanced technology that only some ancient high-tech civilization sprawling over thousands of solar systems might build. 

Quite to the contrary you would probably have started construction before the first interstellar colony ships left on their long voyages. 

I imagine you would get better at building it as your technology improved but you do not actually need to have that improvement. 

So what can a K2 do? 

We have talked about some of their abilities before. 

They can move their own star, albeit slowly, by means of the Shkadov Thruster we discussed in megastructures episode 8 and which is an innate ability of any Dyson Sphere. 

It can flat out blow up any planet in the galaxy, as good as the Death Star from Star Wars, either by use of giant laser beam or more likely laser propelled relativistic kill missiles, RKMs, that we discussed in episode 9. 

It can send those out one after another destroying planet after planet and even arrange for them to hit all at the same time. 

It is civilization that regards building a death star sized object as a minor expense. 

It also is not one that has any shortage of construction material. 

We talked about that a couple weeks ago in the Starlifting episode. 

They also have no shortage of labor to use to construct stuff with even if they haven’t got the kind of super-automation we discussed in the self-replicating machines episode. 

A K2 civilization would outnumber us by at least a billion to one. 

For every citizen we have on Earth they have an entire Earth’s worth of population. 

Even with no other major new technology to their advantage they simply would dwarf us like an elephant next to ant. 

They would presumably have better tech too since where we have hundreds of thousands of researchers they would have hundreds of trillions. 

I have mentioned before, in regard to the Fermi Paradox, that no civilization would bother hiding themselves since once they have sent out those first radio waves the cat is out of the bag. 

I have also mentioned that interstellar empires do not need to wait till a world has discovered radio to detect them. 

This is why, because while we employ thousands of professional astronomers, a K2 civilization could as easily employ trillions. 

Enough to employ more than one person to constantly watch every single star in the galaxy. 

And you could build telescopes much bigger, and also much cheaper, when you already have an industrial base in space. 

They could build a trillion telescopes, each of which made the Hubble telescope look like a toy, each aimed at a solar system constantly and manned. 

This does not even include that they can send ships to all those places too. 

In the star lifting episode we saw that a civilization could pull thousands of Earth’s worth of metal out of their own sun, but even one-thousandth of an Earth’s worth of building material would be enough to build an aircraft carrier mass spaceship 100 trillion times over again. 

Enough to send whole fleets to every single star in the galaxy without making a tiny pinprick in your available construction mass. 

And they can man every single one of those fleets with millions of crew members too. 

Not that you need to send giant armies out to invade other solar systems hundreds of light years away since you can breed your invasion force during the long trip. 

Colonizing the galaxy is obviously not a big problem for them. 

Whether they leap frog from star to star or just settle everything directly from their home system doesn’t much matter. 

They can get out and colonize the galaxy and turn every single star into another Dyson Sphere. 

This is where fiction just breaks down. 

Authors rarely seem to try to tackle a K2 civilization let alone a K3. 

I am not sure if the scale just blows their mind, it certainly blows mine, or if they think the audience just won’t be able get into any story that is set on that kind of scale. 

It’s hard to write about a battle with one when it could dump a billion soldiers on a planet as an invasion force and regard that like sending in a single small squad of advance troops. 

Or that, even if they were quite peaceful, they could have the equivalents to Arlington National Cemetery that could sprawl over entire planet sized areas as labyrinthine necropolises. 

Of course a K2 might be a biologically immortal one, we talked about that option in the Transhumanism video, but if it weren’t, if they were just like us, then they’d have several billion people being born and dying every single second. 

I wouldn’t expect they would bury them all in the same place, or even to necessarily bury them at all, but using the typical 50 square foot burial plotyou would fill up several thousand square miles in a second and have the entire North American continent as nothing but head stones in every direction inside an hour. 

You’d be able to layer the entire planet with corpses every day, and a new one each day. 

Of course there’s no reason you would bury everyone in the same place, and indeed I do not want to imply a K2 would be some unified civilization. 

The thing about a classic Dyson swarm, say one made of rotating habitats in the O’neill Cylinder range, which has about a sixth of land area of Long Island in New York, is that you would need trillions of these things each home to around a million or more people. 

Or less if it was a dedicated nature preserve or something. 

That’s another ability of K2 civilizations, they could devote a tiny portion of their energy budget to nature preserve habitats and have thousands of planet’s worth of habitats just for critters. 

A K2 has over a billion times the living area we do, and you can make habitats on par with large islands or places like Yosemite National Park without needing any super-strong materials and you could make billions of those without them being even a percent of your space, because you have trillions of those kind of habitats. 

Yet in spite of that, when formed up as a Dyson Swarm, they would not be any nearer to each other than a few thousand miles or kilometers. 

Space is big, and a Dyson Swarm is not a 2D flat shell, it can be tens of millions of kilometers thick. 

It’s a foggy cloud not a shell. 

Each of those habitats is basically its own nation-state and if it is orbiting as part of a ring then it only has two permanent neighbors, the one before and the one after it in their orbit around the Sun. 

These are very self-sufficient constructs and it probably could not even be blockaded from the sun’s light since it likely would have a backup fusion reactor or something, and if it did they could have billions of years’ worth of fuel stored up on hand, and they can pretty much recycle everything else. 

Trying to besiege one might be a process of several million years if you are not willing to actually attack it, just embargo it. 

You can certainly blow up an O’neill cylinder, but trying to invade and occupy one would be a nightmare with essentially only two skinny openings to come through. 

So you have a setup that trends toward a lot of autonomy, since once built, especially if they do have fusion technology, they do not need new shipments of material or fusion fuel more often than on huge timelines and you are pretty much limited to telling anyone who feels like being isolationist to do as you tell them or you will kill all of them. 

Which is not as good a negotiating position as it sounds like. 

You have got ‘we will cut off your internet’ and ‘we will blow up your habitat’ as your diplomatic arsenal. 

Presumably you would end up with at least a lot of leagues of associated habitats who had at least a loose set of rules you had to follow to stay in that group. 

It could be a lot more unified than that too, but that is the caveat on the sheer scale of these civilizations because there is no obvious means of compelling unified action short of outright blowing up habitats. 

Don’t expect that to result in inaction though, we have never had a single unified planetary government and we still get a lot done, and that has been the case for countries with very autonomous subdivisions or very unified ones too. 

A billion colony ships launched by a tiny sliver of a K2 instead of hundreds of trillions is still pretty effective at colonizing a galaxy. 

Any individual habitat ought to be quite capable of building an interstellar ark all on its own too, or people from all over could crowdsource them. 

But it is another good reminder of scale, you could have entire religions or political parties kicking around a K2 whose numbers dwarfed even our biggest modern ones that could get regarded as a tiny little cult. 

I was joking after I made the megastructures videos on Discworlds and Hoopworlds that they are indeed very impractical but I figure someone would still build one. 

They are quite impractical but you could crowdsource construction of something like that in a K2 civilization just off the tiny percent of the population who thought it was amusing enough to chip in the equivalent of ten bucks to the fund it. 

They could do the same for whole fleets of colonizing vessels. 

I keep coming back to scale on this because it is what always gets missed in contemplating it. 

I think the mind shudders back from the concept of a K2 civilization, something we might easily be in under a thousand years, because that scale is just so overwhelming. 

It is a civilization in which a band most people have never heard of could fill a planet with their audience and have them packed in as tightly as a mosh pit. 

It is one where the heat energy released by everyone watching a primetime TV show, if released on the Earth, would incinerate every living creature on land. 

Going to war with such a civilization, even if you did not have a technological edge, would not be comparable to the United States fighting a small country like Malta, it would be like the entire NATO alliance picked a fight with a single kindergartener. 

There’s no point trying to hide from such a thing, especially because a classic K2 civilization is not a real one anyway, since they have means to engage in robust colonization of other solar systems long before they reach full K2 status. 

It does not matter what other technology you might have, once you have a basic Dyson Sphere partially built, even just a percent of a percent of percent, you get access to all the energy you need for Interstellar travel. 

We have talked about that before, even if you never get fusion and never get cool things like kugelblitz black holes to drive your starships, you can shove even large ships up to relativistic speeds using nothing more than modern technology and a ton of power. 

Slamming trillions of watts of laser into the back of a spaceship is not the image of space travel we normally have, it is a very brute force technique, but it gets the job done. 

And as I pointed out in the Interstellar Colonization episode, you would also expect them to be settling all those frozen rocks and rogue planets that hang out between solar systems. 

Not to mention colonizing your own outer solar system which we will have an episode on soon. 

So even as that Dyson Sphere is getting built ever more completely, slowly adding more and more objects to the swarm, your outer solar system is getting colonized, your Oort Cloud and every frozen rock in it is being made someone’s home, and all those stars nearby you are getting colonized too. 

And I mean all of them. 

There might be a marked preference for Yellow Suns with Earth-sized planets that have liquid water but when you get to the point that most of your population was not even born on Earth, but in some rotating habitat, a nice ring of asteroids around some red dwarf looks quite appealing. 

Or even a dead white dwarf or a gas giant that’s out in the frozen void This does not even consider that those people might not be much like us, they might be transhuman cyborgs or outright digital people who live on microchips and only care about how many watts of energy they can get their hands on, not what color the sun is. 

Though of course every star is basically white regardless that we tend to call them yellow or orange or red. 

So I would tend to think that by the time most folks completed their first Dyson Sphere they would actually be 2.1 or 2.2. 

Even if 90% of the population lived back around their own sun they could easily have several thousand solar systems settled inside a century of the first ships leaving. 

The nearest star might be 4 light years away but space is three-dimensional, and there are over a thousand solar systems within 50 light years. 

And if you sent a million colonists to each one, they would fill up quite fast. 

People can double in a single generation, more actually, and even more if you have life extension technology good enough that folks are still having children when they are also having great-great-grandchildren. 

People mostly like children, we are kind of wired up to do so, and in a post-scarcity setup they aren’t a huge burden. 

Especially if you are some 400 year old Methuselah who has centuries of knowledge, experience, and accomplishments behind you, and still have all the vigor and hormones of 20 or 30 year old. 

Colonists to new solar systems have no reason not to increase their numbers and quite likely jumped on a ship for a long voyage partially for the ability to do so with impunity, or even applause. 

So you could see Dyson Spheres getting under way around those even before we finished our own while new systems are still being colonized further out way back from Earth and then they start getting underway. 

At the edge of new space you’d probably always have a shell of a few hundred light years of newly colonized systems at various degrees of expansion, around an iron core of Dyson Spheres. 

This would eventually absorb the entire galaxy into a genuine K3 civilization. 

The funny thing is that unless you actually have found some way to travel faster than light, or at least communicate faster than light, both of which are probably impossible, you never get a K3. 

I mentioned already in regard to K2 civilizations that the default setup, trillions of rotating habitats that seem packed together but in reality have a lower population density than earth, would probably tilt toward a lot of autonomy and local sovereignty. 

But there at least you do have the option to have common authority of some sort since you can threaten to just blow up habitats that misbehave too much and there is at least a minimal need to get along and make sure you have some basic rules for radio traffic and ships and habitats to move around. 

It is not much, but there is some minimal need for cooperation and some option to compel people to cooperate. 

Once you get into other solar systems there is just none. 

Yes the original solar system and later the core systems near it will probably have a strong headlock on technology and science and new art and entertainment. 

But it would be very hard to prevent anyone from getting their hands on it considering it would only take one infiltrator with a decent laser beam to send that information on to their rebellious home system. 

So to be honest I just don’t think anyone would try to maintain an interstellar empire. 

I don’t think you would see interstellar wars either. 

I can imagine hundreds of wars going on inside a K2, with armies and fleets that would make World War 2 look like a schoolyard brawl, though ironically even such conflicts might be considered minor squabbles inside an otherwise peaceful solar system. 

But interstellar ones, without faster than light travel, would almost have to be limited to squabbling over all those tiny icy rocks in between those solar systems which might best be regarded as rural villages of mighty metropolises. 

Space, again, is also 3-dimensional, so you have not got a few neighbors to pick a fight with, you have dozens. 

Now I could see interstellar organizations, or relative loose confederations with agreed on trade rules and currency, that sort of thing, but not what we would think of as an interstellar empire, maybe the occasional close union of a few hundred systems set against the backdrop of a few hundred billion colonized systems. 

So in that sense a K3 civilization, as a unified thing, is probably something that can never happen without some sort of workaround to the speed of light. 

As a caveat to this though we need to remember that there are quite a few places in the galaxy where stars are much closer together and in those you could get some genuine interstellar empires. 

Similar, from what you can do with Starlifitng and Shkadov Thrusters you could easily see fairly tightly packed artificially created pockets of red dwarf stars forming some sort of super Dyson. 

Or with fusion, no stars at all just a massive cloud of habitats packed in as tight as they can without cooking form their waste heat or collapsing in together under their collective gravity. 

You get this kind of swarms even if you have better sources of power than suns or fusion, like black holes or antimatter, because you want to be as close as you can to others for communication and the distances between objects in these swarms is already huge enough to satisfy privacy. 

The average distance between habitats is huge, and if that is not intuitive enough, the average distance between individual people if we scattered them evenly would be on an order or tens of miles or kilometers. 

So people are not spacing themselves out more for privacy, they’ve got it. 

They are doing it for waste heat and gravity. 

Closer together allows you to talk to people who are not in your habitat real time or with minimal light lag. 

Historically empires have often managed to keep things welded together even when it took routine communications months to get from point A to B and armies a year or more to travel. 

So if we were generous an and assume a 1-light year radius could hold together, and we contemplated that as a place where we just packed habitats in as much as we could without needing some new way to get rid of heat, that could actually be a few billion times more energetic than a classic Dyson sphere and that would be pretty close to a K3. 

I have no idea what to name something like that and I don’t feel like coining a term so if anyone can come up with one let me know in the comments. 

Some giant sprawl of habitats numbering in the billions of trillions, each running on their own fusion reactor in some giant light-year wide cloud bathed in infrared waste heat. 

Probably with quadrillions of ships flowing in to stop at each one every few thousand years to re-tank their fusion fuel from massive bunkers left over from using starlifting to cannibalize a thousand suns. 

Anyway, that’s about the only scenario I can see, if the speed of light remains a barrier, for anything like a unified K3 civilization, and that could stomp all over a K2 the way a K2 could stomp all over us. 

Now there really is not anything a K3 can do that a K2 could not do anyway. 

They would probably have way better technology but we already agreed not to use that as our standard. 

After all the Kardashev scale is entirely power based and a classic K3 would be a tiny slow pipsqueak compared to a single Matrioshka Brain, which is a K2 or maybe a K2.1 at best, But there is a long way between a K2 and a K3, and any number if 2.1 or 2.2 or 3 could engage in all sorts of projects like moving or making stars. 

I joked about a K2 crowdsourcing the construction of a discworld or hoopworld earlier, these could probably get away with crowdsourcing an Alderson Disc. 

Such civilizations can be moving and making Stars. 

They could be crowdsourcing bizarre megastructures like an entire star with a shell around it in the shape of face of a popular philosopher. 

Or they could be taking an example like the horsehead nebula and sculpting one to look like their favorite musician when viewed from their area of the galaxy. 

You can do some pretty extreme stuff at that level even if you are still running only on the sort of technology we can see ourselves developing in the next century or so. 

You can even start launching projects to go grab other galaxies that left to themselves would drift over the cosmological event horizon and drag them back. 

You can move galaxies as easily as stars, technology-wise anyway, obviously you have to scale things up a lot. 

Our own galaxy will stay locked to a handful nearby us even as the expansion of the Universe drags other galaxies away but you can get out to probably at least several thousand nearby galaxies and convert large chunks of them into Shkadov thrusters powerful enough to shove their galaxy our way fast enough to beat that out. 

Maybe a good deal more too. 

Even if you had to expend fully half that galaxy’s mass to get it back here and it would take a hundred billion years that might be worth it. 

This brings up the notion of civilizations beyond a K3, something Kardashev deliberately avoided defining as he viewed it as rather pointless. 

Even a civilization that had swarmed out over an entire Galactic Supercluster still would not meet the definition of a K4 using our open-ended Sagan modified form. 

And even a civilization which somehow had access to the entire mass of the Universe and could convert it into energy could still only operate as a K5 civilization, on with 10^56 Watts of power to work with, for a few million years. 

Civilizations at that scale can only be contemplated if you definitely have access to either faster than light travel or there is a multi-verse and you can access that. 

Or you have just learned to sneer at the Laws of Thermodynamics and genuinely do have the equivalent of a power strip that can run by plugging it into itself. 

I think we will wrap up on that note. 

As mentioned, we discuss a lot of these ideas more in other episodes and will probably have even more episodes on some of these topics in the future. 

By now you ought to have some feel for how immense these sorts of civilizations can be and why we could and will probably become one ourselves. 

This also wraps up closely with the Dyson Dilemma of the Fermi Paradox since it is contemplating what these sorts of civilizations can do and how likely they are that leads to the conclusion of the Dyson Dilemma that intelligent life must be exceedingly uncommon or we should see these everywhere by now. 

By the way I would like to thank Martin Rezny of Rezonance for providing the musical accompaniment for this episode.

Our topic today is CryptoCurrency and Blockchain, and we are going to go through the basics of what they are, then look at some of the pros and cons and criticism of Cryptocurrency. 

Since it is often seen by many as the currency of the future we will also look briefly at what sort of challenges it might face in interplanetary and interstellar economies, where communications lag might make checking someone’s bank account balance a decade long process and where advanced automation might let you make perfect copies or forgeries of almost anything. 

On top of that we will also looks at some alternative uses for Blockchain which include some surprises like maybe being able to use it for conducting elections with a maximum of privacy and minimum of fraud. 

Before we can get into any of that we do need to cover some basics about currency and money in general and define some terms and concepts. 

I am going to try to keep this as brief and intuitive as possible, so for those of you wanting more detailed looks at certain aspects of it there will be a number of links to more detailed papers in the episode description. 

Banking is not usually considered an exciting aspect of technology and futurism, but it is a very important one so I will try to make it as interesting as possible. 

Money begins replacing direct trade of goods, or bartering, when you start having issues with what is called a ‘coincidence of wants’. 

Which is to say if Frank the Fisher wants something he needs to find someone who wants fish. 

If Frank wants bread, but Bob the Baker does not want fish, then Frank Fisher has to find someone who wants fish and has something Bob Baker wants. 

In an increasingly specialized society that can result in a much longer chain of exchanges and you probably will lose a little bit on each step in the chain, even if just because you are spending time trading goods that could be spent fishing. 

You make money to have something everyone wants so you can just sell your fish to someone who wants them. 

Ideally this should be something light, durable, easy to identify, and hard to forge. 

There’s a couple ways you can do this. 

The first way is representative money, and this is where some token is used in place of an item. 

Say a note that the person who has the note is entitled to fifty sacks of grain. 

Certificates from gold smiths who kept gold securely locked up for other people is another old example and one of the ways paper money came to be in common use. 

This often leads to fiat money, the one mostly in use nowadays, and a type of representative money where it is a bit nebulous what is being represented. 

Fiat currency is one where it isn’t representing any specific thing except maybe trust and stability. 

Trust is a huge factor in any representative money, of course, you need to trust you can redeem a grain token for the amount of grain it says it is worth. 

This is also where we get floating currency, which is what Bitcoin is and why were are looking at this. 

Here the money is not tied to any specific commodity like gold or grain but simply exists and floats around in value. 

I make a million tokens and tell people they are the only legal tender anymore, good for any transaction or debt. 

Now for these million tokens I made, nobody actually knows how much it is worth at first and it will just float around in value until it finds a comfortable place to more or less settle at. 

For the first couple days people might say one token will buy five sacks of grain, then a few days later it might be three sacks instead and finally settle at four, though it will always fluctuate at least a little. 

But there is no commodity backing this money. 

The second type of money is the complete reverse. 

Commodity money, where the money itself has value and is reasonably compact and durable. 

You wouldn’t want use bananas or a haunch of meat. 

Obsidian arrowheads might have been used way back in prehistory, being useful, but also light and durable. 

Precious metals are a common example but can often slowly mutate into a representative fiat currency. 

You pretty much have to alloy gold or silver if you want to use them as a coin for instance since they are soft, and your coins need to be hard to make tampering with them harder. 

Silver coins usually included a fair amount of copper, and often the amount slowly increased too, even though the coins were said to have the same value. 

At one point in the Roman Empire the silver coins being minted contained less than 2% silver. 

So coins often take on a certain amount of trust value, though most commodity money eventually does. 

Commodity money might seem the same as barter at first, where people just exchange items that have worth, but it differs from barter because one type of item ends up being what everything else gets valued in, if you have twenty different items you no longer need to know how much each is worth in terms of the others, just their value in that one key commodity. 

Barter systems often mutate into commodity money, and while this is uncommon nowadays we still see it pop up a lot. 

Barter is common after a disaster for instance, but we often see it develop in prisons, and even in schools, where kids will trade lunch items or toys. 

Often you will see a commodity currency arise, cigarettes being the classic example from prisons. 

And it is almost inevitably a single item, this follows from something called Gresham’s Law, which holds that if you have two commodity currencies in play that people have to accept, pretty soon the one that is seen as more valuable, more good, will disappear from circulation. 

This is easiest to view in terms of coins, as all the silver coins minted last year with 90% silver will start disappearing from circulation as the new ones with only 80% silver come in to circulation. 

People start removing the less debased and more valuable coins. 

It can happen with more classic commodities too, the nicer obsidian arrowheads stop getting traded in favor of cracked ones, or the cigarettes that are not as old and mangled don’t go into circulation and you end up with almost empty crumbled tubes people have removed every fleck of tobacco from. 

If people start trading cans of coffee around, pretty soon all that will be left is the cans of decaffeinated coffee, which is entirely worthless. 

Now if everybody is still fine using this as currency all is well though it is now not really a commodity currency anymore. 

The negative context on this is that it gives people an incentive to misbehave and act dishonestly, which is generally considered a bad thing. 

It becomes more profitable to game the system then to actually do something productive, so you are not only not doing something productive like growing wheat or mining metal but actually hurting other people for your living. 

So we see a progression toward fiat currency in modern times and that combined with technology tends to lead toward digital and electronic money. 

Physical money, like paper money and coins, is decidedly in the minority these days. 

Unsurprisingly transactions of money tend to be pretty heavy on encryption too, but cryptocurrency is a sub-type of digital money, people often assume they are the same thing. 

Technically you probably don’t even need digital money to have cryptocurrency but the logistics of doing it without computers would be a bit mind boggling. 

Obviously encryption is a big part of cryptocurrency, and to do that safely you need lots of computing power, and rapid transmission of information is handy too. 

But let us examine the basic concept in a more primitive setup instead. 

Let us revisit Frank the Fisher and Bob the Baker from earlier. 

Bob is open to taking fish this time but Frank says he has none today, but he still needs bread. 

He will gladly pay Bob with a Fish on Tuesday if Bob will give him some bread today. 

Bob does not particularly trust Frank, he smells kinda fishy after all. 

Frank offers to write it down, an IOU or promissory note for one Fish, but they do not really trust each other and want witnesses and records. 

So Frank writes down on ten slips of paper, “Frank owes Bob one fish” and Bob hands one to each of the villagers who wander into the bakery during this time, and Bob now has 10 different people he can call on to witness this debt of one fish. 

So he gives Frank a loaf of bread, and Frank says great, he is sure he will catch plenty of fish before then and takes a bite of the bread. 

Frank says next week is the right time to catch catfish by the ton. 

Bob groans, he hates catfish and says so, Frank looks apologetically down at the loaf he is chewing and shrugs. 

Now, Gabby the Gardener, who had just come in at the tail end of this with a bushel of tomatoes for trade, says she loves catfish. 

Okay says Bob, this one is easy. 

He takes back the ten slips of paper, from the 10 people, that say Frank Owes Bob one fish and scratches out his name and puts in Gabby’s name, and gives her only 4 loaves of bread of bread for her bushel of tomatoes instead of the usual 5. 

So now Gabby can redeem one fish from Frank any time even though she wasn’t part of the original deal and Frank didn’t actually agree to it. 

The debt has been transferred. 

Now Frank cannot easily erase his debt by sneaking into one of the other villagers homes and changing what the paper said or destroying it or bribing people to lose them. 

He would have to do this with 10 villagers, which would be way too difficult to be practical. 

If there was any discrepancy in what the villagers' papers said, the majority would overrule any corrupted minority. 

In addition, it’s a fair sized village of a lot more than 10 people and he does not remember most of the people Bob gave them to. 

So, by giving a lot of people information about the debt, everyone is sure that it will be accurately recorded. 

Also, by spreading the information to many people, none of whom have a stake in the transaction, nobody involved has to be trustworthy. 

That means you can trade with anyone, even if you don’t like them, trust them, or know them, such as folks from a neighboring village. 

That makes for much easier trade, which tends to be handy. 

Though it would not be for our example because we would end up with huge ledgers crowding people’s houses that folks have to barge into in the middle of the night and spend time hunting for each transaction and every copy of it. 

Obviously computers and the internet help with that, and we can finally move on to Cryptocurrency. 

Bitcoin, the best known of the Cryptocurrencies, is basically this village on a grand scale. 

The strips of paper, the public ledger of the debt or transaction, is the blockchain. 

Frank, the original issuer of credit, is the Bitcoin miner, the person who physically creates the units of currency. 

The big difference between Bitcoin and our village is that the village uses a commodity-backed currency, in our case fish, but Bitcoin is a floating currency. 

That means it is not ultimately backed by any commodity. 

Its value only lies in the difficulty of creating Bitcoin with computers. 

More on that in a moment. 

The other big difference of course is that all your awkward ledger keeping is now being done on computer and by computer, not by hand on paper. 

This ledger of transactions is called a BlockChain. 

A BlockChain is a database of who transferred what to whom and when it happened. 

It differs from just a plain old spreadsheet in that it is broken up into batches of transactions, called blocks, and distributed all over the place, with chains leading to appropriate blocks. 

Multiple copies of each block exist, but nobody has to have them all, which is nice if you are not a village of a few hundred but several billion people all over the planet each conducting a dozen transactions a day. 

Obviously our paper ledger system could not handle something like that. 

Nor could it be easily encrypted and decrypted to allow privacy. 

This, by the way, is where the money is actually stored. 

There’s no physical form or location of it nor file for a specific bitcoin, something that sometimes confuses folks. 

Now the next problem of this sort of currency is that you have to have some sort of control over how much of it is around, and how much if any new coins get made. 

Bitcoin’s approach to this is to have miners, who are basically mining new coins by keeping the blockchains up and running. 

There’s an elaborate and computation heavy process you have to go through to compete for a new coin that relates to the process of maintaining the blockchains themselves. 

So the system keeps running because the only way to mine new coins is to keep those ledgers. 

It is a nice setup since it ensures the people mining the new coins always have a motive to maintain the system. 

But for practical purposes this amounts to huge computational race to get that next coin, because maintaining those ledger does not take nearly as much computing power as that computing power would be worth in actual dollars. 

But the reward is based basically on who is doing the most mining. 

Let me give a quick non-computer analogy. 

Thirty years from now there are very few libraries leftover, the hard copies of the books are just too expensive to maintain. 

Then a big computer virus comes through and just scrambles all the data. 

Fortunately one very wealthy billionaire who still collects books realizes she has a hard copy of almost everything. 

She wants copies made and fast, so she tells people that every day she is going to hand out big chest of gold. 

She randomly picks a dozen books out of her collection and says whoever made a copy of those books today wins, and if many people have made one of those then whoever made the most copies win. 

And she’s going to check a few random pages out of each and also every page needs to be timestamped and has to be from today. 

If no one has one of the books no reward is given, but it is a big chest of gold. 

Thing is, as long as your odds of winning making it profitable to crank out books, you will keep doing it, so anyone keeping track of all the money spent on paper and ink and copier repairs for everyone involved will notice that amount of money is going to rapidly rise till it isn’t much less than the chest of gold is worth Which raises two of our first popular criticisms of cryptocurrency. 

First, since the folks most likely to win a race are those with the most computational power, the currency is arguably based on the commodity of computational power, or for our last example, who owns the most and best copy machines. 

That’s not the criticism, most currencies are based on something even if it is a bit abstract and this is the information age where computers are king. 

The criticism is it gives people an incentive to steal other people’s computing power and electricity, as it is arguably easier to hack a few million people’s machines to run a program in the background just computing away then to buy yourself a lot of computers. 

Or for our book analogy, people break into other people’s homes to steal their paper and pens. 

Second, these computational races are wasted processing power. 

They are arguably not doing anything productive and they are not doing a lot of it. 

I saw one article that said over a hundred times more processing power was being spent on Mining than what Google has in total. 

Processing power costs money and energy, a lot of energy, and we as a civilization are not exactly brimming with cheap renewable energy. 

Now that is an entirely valid criticism but I personally have to reject arguments by folks who say that means Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are not Green. 

A classic mint, run by dragging metals out of the ground or cutting down trees for paper, is also not exactly super-environmental friendly, and paying lots of people to stand at coin or printing presses or guarding those presses and vaults is not exactly productive either. 

Plus we already use a lot of computers and electricity for financial transactions today. 

So it is a valid point but only in comparison to what we do now and I have not seen anyone who raised this one do such a comparison. 

The other objection, about hacking people’s computers to steal their processors, is more valid, and this comes back to Gresham’s Law which I mentioned earlier. 

Again the mining process sucks up a lot of processing power and electricity, but it serves the purpose of keeping the system up and running. 

If people can steal other people’s processing power and electricity to do the job it becomes better to do that then to honestly mine by buying and maintaining a top quality system of your own. 

Of course we also have the concern of hacking people’s actual accounts and stealing their bitcoins, but that is an existing problem of any electronic commerce. 

Now the rebuttal to that is while BitCoin mining was originally expected to use people’s CPUs, before long it was found that graphics cards were way better at it, and not long after that we had the emergence of specialized processors, called ASICs, Application Specific Integrated Circuits, in this case specific to bitmining, which hugely outperform both normal CPUs and graphic cards at this task, costing much less to do much more mining. 

This decreases the motivation to hack other people’s regular old computers. 

So that was a good objection but is less so now with ASICs. 

You don’t break into people’s houses to steal their pens and notebooks when you have some top line copy machine that turn pages on its own and Xerox them, because very few people will have one lying around their home. 

Same reasoning mining firms don’t break into your house trying to steal your non-existent multi-million dollar excavator or the shovel in your shed. 

They have no incentive to go to the effort of doing that and risk going to jail for it. 

We also see cooperative efforts where miners team up and divide a coin when they get one, probably not a surprising outcome in light of Game Theory. 

Incidentally I am lifting quite a few of these criticisms from an essay by Sci-fi Author Charles Stross, which I will attach in episode description. 

He is quite critical of Bitcoin, as you might guess from the title “Why I want Bitcoin to die in a fire”, and there are some good rebuttals to his arguments so I will also link an article by Daniel Jeffries, “Why Charles Stross Doesn’t Know a Thing about Bitcoin”, which was printed in BitCoin Magazine, and so may not be that neutral. 

Another of the objections raised hits at what many see as Cryptocurrency’s biggest strength, which is anonymity. 

This is after all an unregulated and untraceable type of money. 

So it permits a lot of nasty transactions to be conducted with greater ease and less risk. 

Contract killings, selling drugs, trafficking in people, and a lot of other even more heinous things, can be conducted with less risk to people who might otherwise be caught easier and who might be more likely to engage in such behavior when there is less risk of getting caught. 

Of course it is not entirely anonymous since a careful study of IP addresses can potentially expose a transaction, meaning investigators find it irritating because of how hard tracking a transaction is while users find it irritating that it is possible at all. 

The other big problem is tax evasion, it is kind of hard to monitor people’s incomes if they are doing all their exchanges in this type of currency. 

Now, again, many people say that is a big plus, and that obviously depends on your personal ideology about governments and taxes so I won’t comment on that. 

We’ve got more to cover still, so you can see some of the other criticisms and rebuttals in those links I provided. 

Another interesting thing about this sort of concept is it is not just limited to money. 

When I was getting asked by a lot of the audience to cover this topic, which is a bit outside my normal topic zone, I got approached by Edwin Rosero, one of the audience members. 

He’s an artist and musician and he was experimenting with an application called Ascribe that uses a similar technique to bitcoin in order to allow folks to market limited editions of their artwork with validation of authenticity. 

Obviously with digital mediums you cannot stop anyone from making and distributing as many copies as they want. 

Normally in art you’ve got the original and then you have copies of it. 

That includes paintings, there’s a good few companies that will print you out a Van Gogh for a couple hundred bucks with digital accuracy of reproduction on a nice canvas just as good as the original, and these are entirely legal and respectable enterprises, newer works tend to be more expensive simply because they are giving the artist a royalty on the work. 

The ability to track and authenticate authorized pieces, while in its infancy, offers some alternatives to copyright piracy. 

Edwin donated two of his works to the channel, one appropriately titled Bitcoin and the other, Archeometry, which had caught my eye. 

So Blockchain, this concept of distributed and tamperproof ledgers, has non-currency alternative applications, sometimes called altchains. 

One ironic application is the exact opposite of the anonymity application many like about Cryptocurrency, in that you can use blockchain to establish and confirm identity. 

Part of the point of blockchains is to allow us to track who did what and when via a huge distributed and constantly updating database so you can extend that out to permit verification of identity or authenticity in the case of artwork or contracts. 

Something called Smart Contracts are an example of this where essentially the distributed database has an “If X happens, do Y”, so I could put out a contract X, say, get this episode a million views by next Thursday, get Z amount of money, and that contract is out there verified to pay up against that eventuality. 

A person could put out a contract, good for say a thousand bucks, and a buy-in to grab the contract of a thousand bucks, so if it isn’t met that is forfeit as penalty. 

It circumvents a lot of lawyer clauses in contracts and the need for a lawyer, and it does appear these concepts are gaining some ground in asset trading and crowd-sourcing. 

It also circumvents classic escrow accounts, these being funds held by a third party, and those tend to charge fees, highly automated ones could basically minimize or eliminate those. 

Now I have mentioned that it can be used to validate identities with both discretion and certainty, that leads to an obvious application: voting. 

At the time this episode is coming out we have a major election coming up in the United States and as sure as the sunrises, regardless of who wins, there will be issues raised about the legitimacy of the election. 

Voter fraud, tampering with ballots, privacy of ballots, and so on are always major concerns in any electoral process and rightly so. 

There is also always a strong desire to make voting more electronic to save money, elections are incredibly expensive, and I mean on the operating end too not just the campaigning end, and I’m very familiar with both, I am after legally obliged to be. 

Many of those costs are things you could normally reduce to pennies on the dollar with electronics. 

Problem is, electronic voting scares people even more than electronic commerce and banking so we basically use paper for everything. 

Yet we will probably transition to doing this electronically as time goes on. 

I have difficulty imagining a high-tech futuristic society still using pen and paper ballots. 

The ability to have a genuinely secure electronic election offers huge advantages in money and time saved and convenience for voters, which would presumably increase voter participation and also maybe let you have elections on more things and more often. 

Things like Blockchain could hold the key to something like that being possible. 

If so, I would rate this application as the most useful of the alternative applications and maybe even equal to the primary banking application itself. 

Okay, so I mentioned near the beginning we would talk about interplanetary and interstellar economics and banking, and some of the hurdles to doing that. 

Lots of couples have joint bank accounts either can withdraw funds from. 

You’re not limited to just two people either. 

Right now I can open up a joint bank account with 9 buddies, we start up a club and put money in it we can each withdraw from and we can all get an ATM and debit card and go make purchases. 

Now that is fine on Earth. 

Communications time is under a second and banks can keep copies of their database at multiple places at once, so you only lose access to accounts if the terminal you are using is offline. 

If people are all over the solar system though the game changes a lot because you have got light lag of hours, not seconds. 

You and your spouse could put your whole savings in a joint checking account and travel to Mars and Jupiter when they were on the other side of the Sun, an hour communication time each way, and each of you could withdraw the full balance and have two hours before any alarm bells would even go off. 

A group of ten people could all borrow heavily and stick everything they can get their hands on into one joint account and withdraw it all from ten different locations scattered around the solar system and again have hours to make a get away. 

Or even days, the solar system doesn’t stop after Neptune and Pluto, a point we will be looking at in November. 

Neither does the galaxy, at the interstellar scale it could be years before anyone even knew about the theft. 

Now there’s workarounds to this, most have some sort of downside to them like going back to hard currency or banning joint accounts or having long lag times on any major transaction. 

The channel has a lot of clever folks on it so I’m sure some might think of better ways. 

Those are just off the top of my head because I have never seen anyone look into this issue before. 

Banking is kind of boring and doesn’t tend to show up in science fiction too much in any real detail. 

For that matter I have only seen one academic article on cryptocurrency over interplanetary distances, Abrahim Ladha’s “Hypothetical Problems concerning the Theory of Relativity on Cryptographic Currency Implementations”, and it is sadly a neglected area, interplanetary and interstellar economics. 

About the only paper of significance was Paul Krugman’s 1978 “Theory of Interstellar Trade” which he wrote as a bit of joke back when he was teaching at Yale. 

He treats the topic seriously enough, which is mostly how to treat interest rates when you have time dilation from interstellar travel, but the tone is humorous and non-rigorous. 

Still it’s a good read so I will attach both his and Ladha’s paper in the episode description too. 

We just can’t get around that time lag concern for cryptocurrency and blockchain without some sort of Faster Than Light Communication but we would have similar problems with other systems too and banking long predates light-speed communication so I imagine it is a manageable problem. 

It is worth keeping in mind though when we try to consider civilizations on the scale of solar systems or galaxies, what are often known as Kardashev 2 and 3, or K2 and K3, civilizations. 

Which is our topic for next week, and we will spend some more time considering the difficulties such civilizations have in terms of staying unified while exploring just how immense they are and what sort of awesome things they can do even if they are not all that technologically advanced or unified. 

We’ll also be exploring some more of these difficulties at a much more-near term scale in an upcoming video on Colonizing the Outer Solar System. 

There’s a number of things we did not get to cover today. 

We have not talked about the legal aspects, which are numerous, nor the issues with hacking, which are quite serious too. 

We also kept the math, programming, and computer code to a bare minimum. 

The links provided in the episode description will help you navigate those matters if you want to learn more about the specifics. 

Personally I have no idea if Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will catch on, though I am quite sure some of the other applications of Blockchain will. 

Our goal today was just to cover the basics with a bit more detail than most articles do and with a little less hype and little more intuitive explanations, so hopefully now you have a clearer image of what this stuff is. 

Again next week we look at the Kardashev Scale, and the schedule after that is not fixed just yet but the topics coming up for November are going to be Bioforming and Gene Tailoring, and our last Patreon Winning Topic, the Stellar Compendium, where we will demystify a lot of terms and concepts and look at some of stranger star like Dark Matter Stars or Quark stars. 

As mentioned we will be looking at Colonizing the Outer Solar System too. 

Lastly, fellow Youtuber Joe Scott and I will be collaborating on a pair of videos on the Great Attractor, and so I will be finishing up the Dark Trilogy on Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Dark Flow with the episode, “Dark Flow &amp; the Great Attractor”. 

The exact dates for any of those are still hazy, so make sure to subscribe to the channel for alerts when those and other episodes come out, and if you enjoyed the episode, make sure to like it and share it with others. 

Until next time, thanks for watching, and have a Great Day!

Starlifting
---
  
2016-10-06  
https://youtu.be/pzuHxL5FD5U  

---

So today’s topic is Starlifting, a way of removing mass directly from a star, like our sun. 

I have talked about starlifting from time to time in the past but never in any detailed way, so we will explore it in depth today. 

How you would do this and why you would do this are our primary goals for today, though we are going to cover them backwards, by asking why you want to do this, then discussing the various methods. 

I should add if you are new to this channel that this probably is not the best episode to begin with, it is loosely tied into the megastructures series. 

So while you do not need to have watched those first, it will help, and you may want to watch them and come back. 

Or watch them afterwards, particularly episodes 4, 5, and 8. 

Before we jump into to how we gather matter from off a star let’s talk about why you would do this. 

There’s basically seven reasons: 1. 

To get hydrogen from the star 2. 

To get the other elements from the star 3. 

To make heavier elements via Transmutation 4. 

To extend the lifetime of a star 5. 

To decrease the brightness of a star 6. 

To make new stars 7. 

To prevent a larger star from exploding Now many of those overlap of course but they form your motivations for doing this, and it is a time and effort intensive process so you need good motivations. 

I joked in the teaser for this episode last week that it is how you destroy a star, which is true enough, but it is like destroying a star the same way you destroy a mountain by mining it. 

Destruction is not your real objective. 

Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen, the most abundant type of normal matter in the universe. 

They convert that into helium to produce energy by nuclear fusion. 

In the largest stars, as their cores get depleted of hydrogen and they begin burning helium, they can also produce heavier elements too. 

Now if we have working nuclear fusion, especially fusion that can, like a star, turn normal hydrogen into helium, then stars are handy places to find hydrogen to fuel your fusion reactors. 

But the sun is not the best place to mine for hydrogen, since Jupiter has tons of it and is easier to get it from if you already have fusion to power all your extraction efforts. 

Jupiter is big, but not as big as the Sun, so the gravity is less and it is not as hard to get the hydrogen away from it. 

Of course it is not as big, so it does not have nearly as much hydrogen and if you run out you have to turn to the Sun. 

In fact you would probably start with the smaller gas giants like Saturn to begin with for the same reason. 

Saturn has less gravity, so it is less effort getting the stuff. 

Now, even without fusion, hydrogen has three very good uses. 

First it is incredibly plentiful, so makes a nice source of mass when you are building things like the Shell Worlds we discussed in Megastructures Episode 5. 

When you just need mass, Hydrogen is pretty handy. 

Second it is actually one of the best radiation shields you can get, it’s not only plentiful and useless for normal construction, but is great for stopping high energy radiation. 

As such, it makes a nice shielding layer around things like the rotating habitats we discussed in Megastructures episode 4. 

Being cheap and plentiful you can shield space stations from collisions, radiation, and attack by having thin-walled tanks of hydrogen surrounding your structure like armor. 

If you are powering that with a fusion reactor it also makes a good place to store your fuel. 

Third, hydrogen is plentiful in the Universe, but in the inner solar system it is quite uncommon, with the obvious exception of the sun itself, and oxygen, the third most abundant substance in the Universe is the most common substance in the inner solar system, and those two make water which is important for life. 

So if you want lots of water, just about all of it is on Earth, and you will need a lot of hydrogen to make more of that. 

Those are the most obvious uses for hydrogen itself, besides making new stars which we will get to in a bit. 

But it is easy for folks to forget that hydrogen and helium are not the only things in the sun, and we call everything but these two metals. 

A star’s metallicity is a measure of everything else in it besides hydrogen and helium, even though very little of that is what we would normally call metals. 

We actually break stars into three categories, population 1, 2, and 3 based on how much metal they have in them. 

The very oldest stars, the ones still alive from back near the beginning of things or in distant galaxies where we can see back in time to the early universe, are population 3 stars and have virtually no metals. 

Newer stars have more because when old stars explode and release metals it tends to get just as many of those in the stars as the planets get. 

Population 2 stars are considered metal-poor, and they are a bit hotter and bluer than Population 1 stars, metal rich stars, since they can run a bit hotter without those metals interfering with fusion. 

Population 2 and 3 stars are not considered great candidates for having nice rocky planets like Earth since the emerging solar system would not have had many metals to form rocky planets from. 

Our sun is defined as Population 1, metal-rich, which means it has a bit less than two percent of its mass from stuff besides hydrogen and helium, most of which is oxygen. 

A bit less than two percent might not sound like much, but it means the sun has more of these metals than the rest of the solar system combined, since even Jupiter, which outmasses the rest of the solar system combined itself by a large margin, only masses a thousandth of what the sun does and it is mostly hydrogen and helium too. 

Meaning the sun has something like twenty times Jupiter’s total mass, or six or seven thousand times the Earth’s mass, in these metals. 

You might think denser materials would be all packed up in the core of the Sun, but they tend to be fairly well-distributed throughout. 

The sun is quite convective and the contents mix around like a bubbling soup. 

So, if you lift matter off the Sun you will get plenty of these metals too. 

Most is oxygen, and the biggest chunk of the remainder is carbon followed by nitrogen, and those are the three biggest consumers of mass when you are trying to make artificial space habitats and planets. 

Whenever I am talking about Dyson Spheres… which is technically almost never since I am usually talking about Dyson Swarms instead… I get asked by some where you would come up with all the mass to build one of the spheres or swarms. 

Now as I have mentioned in the past there is more than enough material in the Planet Mercury alone to build a small swarm of thin power collectors around the sun, but if you need a lot of mass so you can build more substantial structures the Sun is a great source in and of itself. 

If you extracted all those elements besides hydrogen and helium from the Sun you would have a couple thousand times more of them then you would from disassembling all the rocky inner planets and asteroids combined. 

If we were envisioning trying to build a classic Dyson shell around the sun out at Earth’s distance this would per a surface of around 3 x 10^23 square meters. 

If you only use Earth’s mass this would only give you about 20 kilograms per square meter, again more than enough for solar panels around the sun but not much to live on. 

Yank all that matter out of the sun and this becomes a much more robust figure of about 100 tons a square meter. 

Which is definitely a comfortable amount of material to be building human habitats out of. 

You have everything you need to make rock and water and air out of. 

Of course if that is not enough we still have the option of transmutation. 

Heavier elements are made by nuclear fusion, hydrogen turns into helium that turns into carbon, oxygen, and so on. 

So hypothetically you can turn hydrogen into, say, iron, with some steps in between, and actually gain energy from doing this. 

We have not yet mastered the easiest type of fusion, which is hydrogen’s isotopes deuterium and tritium. 

But if we managed to get this unlocked we might be able to do plain, vanilla hydrogen fusion too, and learn to turn helium into carbon, which is even harder, and possibly all the higher ones. 

It is all about getting a high enough temperature and pressure in your reactor, and if you can do that you can not only make those higher elements in a reactor, but get a net positive amount of energy out of it. 

Two birds with one stone. 

This is obviously preferred and if you can do it, since you can not only yank hydrogen and helium off your sun and turn them into whatever you want but also gain power from it. 

But right now we can make these thing by slamming lighter nuclei together in a super-collider. 

That costs power, quite a lot of it, but if you need heavier matter because you don’t have enough of it, and most of your Dyson Swarm consists of power collectors, not artificial habitats, you can use all that extra power from the sun to scoop hydrogen and helium up from the sun and run it around a giant supercollider also powered by the sun. 

As you do this you will also be decreasing the mass of the Sun and so also decreasing its power output, but that is actually a good thing since if the sun is getting dimmer while you are making more matter to build stuff around it you will also need less and less matter to absorb all that light, since there is less of it, and you just keep going until you reach a happy medium. 

You make your star lighter and lighter and dimmer and dimmer making material to encompass that star, until you have what you need to encompass that newer dimmer star that doesn’t need as much mass to encompass it anymore. 

So it really doesn’t matter how inefficient this process is, but again the fusion of matter into heavier elements produces energy so there’s a very good chance you could run this operation at a profit rather than having to dump tons of energy down the drain for transmutation, but if that’s your only option it is still doable. 

Of course, that is not the only reason to decrease a star’s mass. 

Stars get dimmer as they lose mass, quite a lot dimmer too. 

A star twice as massive as our sun is not twice as bright, they are about 16 times brighter, while one half as massive as us is about one-sixteenth as bright. 

Because of this, even though bigger stars have more fuel, they do not live nearly as long, less than you would think since they tend to explode long before they use up all their hydrogen. 

Smaller stars use a lot more of their hydrogen and they use it a lot slower, so they live a lot longer. 

Our sun is about halfway through its life of about ten billion years, ones twice as big live a bit under 2 billion years while one half our size would live more like 60 billion years. 

So we could extend our Sun’s lifetime by removing some of its mass, more than you might expect since by decreasing that mass we let it stir around its contents more to make it keep going longer with less helium in the core killing the current hydrogen fusion process. 

Indeed you could constantly starlift, removing the helium and other elements and dumping the hydrogen back down, and even adding more hydrogen from other sources to potentially extend that star’s life indefinitely so long as you have hydrogen to keep adding. 

And again, smaller stars churn their contents up more so decreasing a star’s mass makes it easier to remove the helium which could be thought of as the poison or toxin that kills stars. 

Also again, smaller star, dimmer star, less material needed to make use of the light it does put off. 

Yank just 10% of our sun’s mass off and it would be about two-thirds as bright as now, needing only two-thirds the material to construct a Dyson swarm, and you will have about 30,000 times the mass of Earth in matter to play with. 

Of course what you do with all that removed hydrogen and helium is another story. 

So is capturing it when it comes off the sun which we will talk about when we discuss how you actually do starlifting in a couple minutes. 

You have the option of making another smaller sun out of it, and again smaller suns are a lot better at converting hydrogen to helium without exploding before they finish. 

It is generally thought that stars under about a quarter of the mass of our own sun, smaller red dwarf stars, do not even become red giants as other stars do near the end of their life but just turn into blue dwarf stars instead. 

Not expanding just getting hotter then turning into white dwarf stars at the end. 

We cannot be sure since no star in the universe of that mass has been around long enough to do this. 

But these are the type of red dwarf stars that are thought to be able to live over a trillion years. 

The ones a bit more massive live a lot longer than our sun but still go red giant at some point before they go through all their hydrogen, so they live significantly shorter lives than these. 

Most stars in the Universe are Red Dwarf stars too, and we are talking about maybe turning our own sun into one by starlifting, so let me remind everyone that the color of stars is a bit of a misnomer, they all give off white light. 

The spectrum is a bit different but even the dimmest and coldest red dwarf would give a light similar to an incandescent light bulb. 

I have heard people object to the idea of settling worlds around red dwarf stars because they would not want live under red light, besides this being, presumably, much better than not being alive at all, I mean, I would rather live in the tundra than not at all, it’s also wrong since the light will be about the same as what you are used to. 

If you really wanted that hotter, whiter light you could just make blue dwarf stars from the outset by using a mixture of hydrogen and helium anyway, if you are in the star making game. 

Gives you something to do with all that helium, I suppose. 

But speaking of dying stars and red giants brings up our last use of starlifting, which is preventing the bigger ones from exploding. 

Now I mentioned back in the Shkadov Thrusters episode, which dealt moving stars, that it easier to move bigger ones than smaller ones. 

The result of which is that if you have a giant star getting ready to go supernova it is easier to move it away from your own solar system than to move your solar system. 

A better option anyway, since you probably colonized many solar systems in that area so it is better to give the boot to the single big problem child in your neighborhood than to move all the other colonized solar systems. 

But Starlifting offers us an alternative to that. 

You get in there and instead of using that star’s light to push it away, you use that light to power starlifting and strip mass off the star before it can explode violently. 

And while Supernovae are our main source of metals, that is not an efficient process anyway so you would probably be better off using the supercollider approach even if you have not got some easier method of transmutation available. 

Okay, so lastly, how do we actually do this? 

As I mentioned there are multiple methods, but there are three key ones that usually get discussed and I will limit us to those. 

With the exception of mentioning the most simple and obvious, which is just flying down there and scooping the matter up and flying away. 

They did that in the TV show Stargate Universe and it was probably my favorite scene in the sadly short-lived spin-off my favorite science fiction franchise. 

This is not going to be a practical approach unless you have all sorts of awesome technology we do not have. 

It is also generally called Sun Scooping, not Star Lifting, though it is both. 

When you start talking about harvesting stars for their matter, people tend to assume only very high technology civilizations could do such things. 

Some of us call that Clarketech, as a hat tip to Arthur C. Clarke and his quote about any sufficiently advanced technology being indistinguishable from magic. 

The methods we will be talking about are not high-tech at all, much like Dyson Swarms, while people think of them as super-high-tech, as Clarketech, they can be done with just raw brute force. 

You do not need much technology. 

All three of these methods we are about to discuss were thought up, to the best of my knowledge, by David Criswell who also is assumed to have coined the term Starlifting. 

They are: 1. 

Thermal Driven Outflow 2. 

Centrifugal Acceleration, and 3. 

The Huff and Puff Method I always get a kick out of the name for the last one. 

Okay, the first, Thermal Driven Outflow, which I will just call TDO Starlifting henceforth or TDO, basically works by heating up bits of a star’s atmosphere. 

You can do this by beaming down microwaves powered by solar panels, or even just reflecting light back down focused on a spot with big mirrors. 

Those mirrors could hover over the same spot instead of orbiting, using the Statite method we have discussed in the past. 

This would kick up an eruption much like a solar flare, feeding more solar wind, you would then have a giant ring around the sun sucking up sunlight and generating a big ring of current as well as a huge toroidal magnetic field. 

This would tend to pump this matter up or down out the poles of the sun, which is handy since we live around the equator. 

Incidentally, you could do this on the Sun right now to collect the normal solar wind, but our Sun’s solar wind does not give off that much matter. 

Bigger stars give off tons that way, but for ours you need to be blasting spots to cause eruptions and increase the solar wind. 

Now the capture method for this stuff as it heads up from the pole is to use giant magnetic rocket nozzles. 

Magnetic nozzles are a concept that’s been discussed for use in the VASIMR thruster which we discussed along with some other propulsion methods a couple episodes back. 

This lets you use magnetic fields to direct plasma rather than having it flow through a classic metal nozzle which would get kind of hot. 

It also cools the plasma slightly, making it much easier to collect. 

Two quick notes: First the ring around the sun does not have to be a solid object, it can just be a bunch of orbital stations, they can just shoot streams of charged ions between each other to make that ring of current, each station is a particle accelerator presumably powered by sunlight. 

But you could use a solid one and it would not fly apart or anything, it is not a Niven-style Ringworld under huge centrifugal force, though we discussed making giant stationary rings back in the first episode of the megastructures series if you want one. 

A solid one is maybe more useful if you want to have a massive collection of supercolliders for transmutation of elements. 

Second, the nozzles are probably way too dense to work as Statites, unlike mirrors which can just hover over the sun bouncing light back down, and they need to stay over the poles, so if you are wondering how they would, just remember they are called giant magnetic rocket nozzles for a reason. 

They can keep themselves from falling down by sucking in all that matter flying off the star at high speeds. 

Giant Plasma Thrusters. 

Notice by the way that TDO Starlifting is not particularly high tech, and I want to emphasize that. 

Okay, method 2, Centrifugal Acceleration, or CA starlfiitng. 

This is a lot like TDO Starlifitng but you put your ring around the poles instead, and your nozzles around the equator. 

You then rotate your ring a lot faster than that star rotates, and rotate it around the star’s poles and it starts flinging matter outward. 

This is much harder, since you have to keep pushing on that ring to keep it spinning, but as I understand it this is supposed to create a much faster outflow of matter, albeit sprayed all over the place, so I think this would be the sort of thing you would do if your main goal was not harvesting the star for matter but just lightening it in a hurry. 

TDO is better, or at least simpler. 

Okay, Method 3, Huff and Puff, which I guess we would call H&amp;P Starlifting. 

Huff and Puff sounds cooler though, but the actual effect is more like a bellows. 

Here your ring of particle accelerators are not staying up by orbiting the sun but magnetically floating over it, akin to the electrodynamic tethering method we discussed in the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium, but it is the ring current they are generating that is holding them up. 

You then shut the ring current off and let the stations begin to fall. 

Once they pick up a lot of speed you snap the ring current back on and they begin flying back up away from the sun, rinse and repeat. 

Doing this generates a squeezing action on the sun pumping the sun’s atmosphere up through the poles, again to be caught by the magnetic rocket nozzles. 

If you are only using one ring to do this you would get that beating pulse or bellows effect on the polar matter stream but you could have several rings doing this at once in well-timed pumping action for a bigger and more steady outflow of matter. 

Personally this is the one I like the most, partially for the name, and it should be faster than TDO which is a much more passive process. 

Okay, some notes on lifting matter: Removing matter from the sun cost about 200 billion joules per kilogram, and that’s the minimum if you are doing it with 100% efficiency. 

That’s a thousand times what is to get off Earth, so do not think this is an easy process. 

That said, while it costs a couple hundred billion joules of energy to yank a kilogram of matter off the sun, fusing a kilogram of hydrogen into helium produces gets you more than thousand times that much energy so even if you are not doing it too efficiently the sun provides a lot more power from fusion then is needed to take the sun apart. 

If you used the sun’s entire energy output at 100% lifting efficiency you could remove about an Earth’s worth of mass this way every century, and take apart the sun in about 30 million years. 

Realistically even getting 10% efficiency would be very impressive, and you would not be using all the sun’s light for this, so think of this as a very slow process. 

Not that the more optimistic 30 million years is exactly fast. 

Giant stars have more binding energy but are a lot less dense, they’re much bigger than their mass would indicate, especially red giants which are often as big as a Dyson Sphere but only as massive as our own sun. 

They are also way brighter, giving you way more power to work with, so you can pull one apart a lot faster. 

I would not want to go racing off trying to prevent a supergiant star that just transitioned into a red supergiant and trying to suck the mass off it before it went supernova, they usually only spend one or two million years in that state, but you probably could do it. 

Needless to say getting there when they are younger is a smarter idea. 

But that is one of the reasons why I tell people that Interstellar civilizations do not need to worry much about a supernova wiping them out. 

A Supernova is not particularly big threat to a K2 civilization let alone a bigger one, and anyone engaging in Starlifitng is almost by definition a K2 Civilization or very close to it. 

Speaking of which, in two weeks we will be discussing a lot of the other cool things a K2 civilization, or Kardashev 2 civilization, can do in an episode on the Kardashev Scale. 

We have talked about that before but always in passing and usually just one cool thing they can do. 

That topic got picked by the Facebook group, Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, and we always have a poll going on over there to pick topics for the channel so head on over and join and vote. 

This week’s video was selected as a topic by our Patreon group, the winner being Bill Mains, and I wanted to thank him for selecting this topic and helping me plan out the material. 

We also have our third and final topic winner, Neo Navras, who has selected Stars as our topic which we will do sometime in November. 

We still need to flush out what will be covered but I will be demystifying a lot of the astronomical terms and also discussing a lot of the weird hypothetical stars like Quark Stars or Dark Matter Stars. 

These Patreon picks have been a lot of fun to do so I will probably continue this with modification in the future. 

I’ll put those details out when I decide the best way to do that. 

Next week’s topic however is CryptoCurrency and BlockChain, and we will be looking at these concepts and contemplating how they might be useful in related areas or for things like interstellar commerce, when it might take years to confirm someone’s bank account balance if they are visiting your solar system. 

So again, next week is Cryptocurrency, don’t forget to subscribe to the channel if you want alerts when that and future videos come out, and in the meantime you can try out some of the other episodes on the channel.

Dark Energy

2016-09-29  
https://youtu.be/7w1t5ipDkjE  

---

Today we will be looking at Dark Energy, the mysterious force that is making the Universe expand, and I am going to try to clear up some of the confusion on this topic. 

A few weeks back we looked at Dark Matter, and I pointed out there that Dark Matter and Dark Energy have few things in common. 

One is that they have the word dark in them, another is that they make up most of the matter and energy in the Universe, and a third is that we do not know much about either, part of why they are called dark. 

This is especially true of Dark Energy, about which we know very little, but we have not been studying it as long. 

We do not know much about it but at the same time it is not that mysterious, and we might as well start at the beginning, since that was a bit under 20 years ago. 

Now to be fair, some of the concepts used in and around dark energy are older than that, but Dark Energy as a term popped up when I was in college. 

Michael Turner coined the term in 1998 when I was 17 and just starting my junior year in college but I don’t recall hearing the term for another year or so when I attended a colloquium on it, and at the time the interest was all in Supernovae and whether the universe was going to expand or collapse, it was just getting hinted at that accelerating expansion might be on the table and all those options were inside the margins of errors. 

At least as I recall, to be honest I mostly sat through the weekly department colloquiums for the free coffee and cookies those days, I was very much a novice in my studies and the topics were pretty over my head. 

In any event the focus at that time was on Supernovae, and at that time we actually had not detected many, which was why the margins of error were so large on cosmological expansion back then. 

Some of you might recall that Robert Evans, a minister from Australia who was an amateur astronomer, had amazed everyone with discovering tons of them by direct visual observation, over 40, and for a while in the mid 90’s a sizable fraction of the supernovae we knew of were his discoveries. 

So not a big sample. 

Now why does that matter? 

Supernovae come from multiple sources, most people are familiar with it as an old giant star exploding, but a type Ia supernova is one that occurs when a binary star system with one of the stars having already died and turned into a white dwarf star begins sucking up matter from its neighbor. 

Once that white dwarf sucks up enough matter, to become about one and a half times more massive than our own sun, it explodes as a supernova. 

There is a maximum amount of mass a white dwarf can have, this varies a bit on its composition and spin rate, but once it hits that mass limit it will erupt as a Supernova. 

This tends to release about the same amount of energy each time, about 1 to 2 x 10^44 Joules, and with similar spectral characteristics, so it makes an excellent Standard Candle. 

That being an object that we can look at and say ‘ah, this must be such and such a distance away, with such and such a redshift, and therefore speed away from us’. 

Now no two Supernovae are exactly the same but these white dwarf stars exploding as supernovae is a fairly small window, and of course they are quite bright so we can see them billions of light years off. 

This is not a video on Supernova, but as a fun fact, the classification system for Supernova, sometimes called the Minkowski-Zwicky system, takes that name from astronomer Rudolph Minkowski, who was the nephew of Hermann Minkowski, one of Einstein’s teachers, and the same Fritz Zwicky who coined the term Dark Matter and the term Supernova and found around 120 of them himself, a record only surpassed about 7 years ago. 

In any event as we catalogued more and more of these standard candles it began getting pretty obvious that the expansion of the Universe was not slowing down. 

We would expect that it would, as gravity began pulling things back together. 

What we saw instead was that it was speeding up. 

How do we know this? 

Redshift is how much light shifts to longer wavelengths based on how fast the object is moving away from us. 

Everything in the Universe besides our galaxy and its nearest neighbors is red shifting away from us, meaning it is moving away from us, and that is how we got the notion that the Universe is expanding and presumably once was much smaller, from whence comes the Big Bang Theory. 

The further away something is, the more red shifted it is, meaning the faster it is moving away. 

The further out in space you look the more red-shifted stuff is. 

We can also pin down the distance to a type Ia supernova quite well because they all tend to be about as bright, so you can calculate how far away they are based on how much fainter they are. 

This is the same as if I told you passing airplanes all had 1000 watt light bulbs on them for navigational lights, you could figure out how far away they were by how much dimmer those lights were and from that determine their speed, simply from knowing how bright those navigational lights were. 

But you would also have some uncertainty because not every bulb would be exactly the same brightness. 

Different manufacturers, ages on the lights making them dimmer, dust and grime over the transparent plate covering the bulb, that sort of thing. 

Those would all limit how precise you could be regardless of how accurate your own equipment was. 

And the same is true of a type Ia supernova. 

So we cannot be too precise with each individual supernova but as we measured more and more of them we could get an increasingly accurate picture. 

I want to stress that because once the effect got noticed it took some years of observations to shrink the margin of uncertainty down enough to be sure. 

As I mentioned, when I first heard of it in a colloquium right around the turn of the century those uncertainties were still high enough it looked likely but hardly certain the rate of the universe expanding was faster and faster. 

If the Universe’s expansion was constant, we would expect an object to be at one spot, whereas if it were getting faster, then it would have been slower in the past, closer than constant expansion would produce, while if gravity was slowing the expansion down it would have been faster in the past and the object further away than you would expect. 

As you know it turned out to be the former, that the expansion is increasing in speed. 

But I wanted to cover that because people tend to skip it when talking about Dark Energy. 

There is other evidence for Dark Energy but that was the big one that established that the Universe was expanding at an accelerating rate. 

We will skip detailing those other methods, they are handy for an alternative proof or refining our figures but supernova is how we determined it and also I think the most conceptually simple approach. 

The others all require discussion of topics that would need whole episodes to themselves, which we might do someday. 

Now you might be asking, what does the Universe expanding have to do with Dark Energy? 

Well it takes energy to make the universe expand faster and faster and we call that energy Dark Energy. 

It is the energy expanding the Universe. 

Or at least it probably takes energy, so it is called Dark Energy, rather than just ‘that weird thing making the universe expand, which energy would seem the best candidate for’ Matter pulls on other matter by gravity, so on first inspection you would expect things moving away from us to start slowing down. 

As we just covered, that is what we expected to find with the Supernova measurements and did not get. 

For this not to be happening it takes some force or energy. 

Now what is strange about this is that it isn’t getting diluted as space expands. 

Everything else does. 

Gravity keeps our galaxy together and bound to our nearest neighbors, so our density has not particularly changed with time, but the overall density of the universe is constantly decreasing as space expands. 

Same stuff, more space, lower density. 

But not Dark Energy, that seems to be constant at a bit less than a billionth of a joule per cubic meter. 

That might not sound like much but it means a cubic light year has more energy in it than all the energy the sun has emitted during human history. 

It’s a lot of energy, and it is everywhere, every cubic light year, be it in our solar system or outside our galaxy or even those giant voids, which actually are not that empty of normal matter either. 

Voids are a topic for another time too but they are one of the other evidences for Dark Energy. 

And it isn’t like normal matter that likes to clump together into stars and planets and people, or like dark matter, which as we discussed last time at least tends to clump up at the galactic scale. 

It is everywhere, evenly spread. 

Now that should be tripping some alarm bells in your head because I just said it is like that everywhere and not getting diluted, while the Universe is expanding. 

Same density of energy, even while the Universe gets bigger, and that means more energy. 

If I expand the Earth, we would expect its density to decrease, if it is not it is getting matter from somewhere. 

If I am expanding the Universe and it is keeping the same energy density while I do that, I am getting new energy from somewhere. 

That would seem to be a blatant violation of Conservation of Energy, one of the most bedrock laws of science. 

And it might well be, but Energy is a pretty ill-defined concept in general relativity, probably not too surprising since the unit of energy, the joule, is made of the units for mass, space, and time which you know also act weird in general relativity. 

You can read some wonderful arguments about whether or not we should say energy is conserved in General Relativity or Dark Energy, but it is important to emphasize, I think, that they are actually arguments of whether or not we should ‘say’ it is. 

The argument is not really about what is going on but how to phrase it to folks who are not physicists or mathematicians. 

I, personally, tend to agree with Cosmologist Sean Carroll that it is just easier to say that energy is not conserved when space time is changing. 

This seems intuitively straight forward then in this case, as the Universe ages and pumps out more and more brand new space from seemingly nowhere this new space brings energy with it. 

We do not know where Dark Energy or this new space comes from, but if you wanted to think of it as leaking in from somewhere else I would not say that was wrong. 

It also rather neatly circumvents the whole conservation issue anyway, since we already know no system is being conserved when it is not closed because something is pumping more stuff into it from the outside. 

I will include a blog post from Sean Carroll discussing this conservation of energy issue in more detail in the episode’s description. 

As a last note on that aspect of things though, if we do have space and energy leaking in from elsewhere that makes folks wonder what that place would be. 

Indeed Dark Energy does often come up in regards to the higher-dimensional aspects of String Theory, or in the idea of Multiverses, or the Fine-Tuning Argument in general. 

However, I like to remind people that we already had this problem with the Big Bang itself, with space, time, and energy just coming out of nowhere. 

So I do not consider it strong evidence for any of those. 

I just do not think we know enough yet to speculate in that regard. 

Speculation is always good, but such things tend to be impossible to experimentally verify so to me they are the places you go when you exhaust all other alternatives. 

One of the popular ideas though is that there is an energy cost for space to exist, so that Dark Energy is constant everywhere and evenly distributed in space because it is the actual energy of space. 

It is kind of like saying that water is evenly distributed throughout the ocean. 

You can dump more water in the ocean but any given bit of it will have the same amount of water as another. 

Water, like most liquids, is incompressible, or very nearly so, that is how hydraulics works. 

A kilogram of water takes up a liter of space, or one gram per cubic centimeter, whether it is at the bottom of the ocean or the top. 

Dark Energy appears to be a lot like that, it is just the basic minimum energy needed for space to exist, or the minimum energy a space will have perhaps. 

It takes a gram of water, or 9 x 10^13 Joules of energy, to make a cubic centimeter of ocean exist. 

Well it takes about 10^-29 grams of matter or 10^-15 joules, a femtojoule, to make a cubic centimeter of space exist. 

And again space and time and energy are all pretty thoroughly connected at a fundamental level, that is not exactly new and deep thinking, so if you have more space, from the Universe expanding, it is not a big leap to assume there was energy connected to doing that. 

One of the big candidates for Dark Energy is a familiar term, Vacuum Energy, and it is more or less the same concept as Zero Point Energy, a popular one in science fiction. 

Like I mentioned there is not much dark energy in a tiny bit of space, but there is an awful lot of space, so it adds up. 

Tapping that for power is, of course, incredibly tempting and has become a common theme in sci-fi. 

I have never personally heard a good scheme for how you could do this and I tend to be of the opinion you cannot. 

Hypothetically if you could suck in a chunk of space, leaving it missing, you maybe would get some energy from doing that, but how you do that is a complete mystery to me. 

Anyway vacuum energy is full of all sorts of virtual particles constantly popping in and out of existence, or some sort of existence anyway, we talked about those some episodes back when discussing them and micro-black holes and Hawking Radiation. 

Zero Point Energy itself is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may have, essentially that even if I took a box full of particles and reduced it to absolute zero it would still have some energy. 

Now to the best of our knowledge you cannot reduce anything to Absolute Zero, but even if you could it would still have this Zero Point energy leftover. 

This is the energy that is still there even after you have extracted everything else so it is sort of counter-intuitive how you would get more energy out of it. 

I would say the key thing to take out of that though is that any given volume or space has energy associated to it, even if it is empty of normal matter and does not have photons passing through it. 

This does bring up the Vacuum Catastrophe though because when we calculate the amount of energy Quantum Field Theory tells us should be in a given chunk of space we get one value but when we check that experimentally – this energy should exert gravity after all – we get nothing like that. 

As I mentioned earlier when we calculate this energy based off the gravity it should be exerting we come up with something like a billionth of a joule per cubic meter or less. 

This is what we get from observing the Universe. 

But when we run the numbers that Quantum Field Theory offers us, by looking at the subatomic scale rather than the intergalactic scale, the values it gives us are not tiny fractions of a joule per cubic meter but more than the entire mass energy of the Universe squeezed into a spot smaller than a single proton. 

You can see then why this is called the Vacuum Catastrophe or the worst prediction in the history of physics. 

I will attach an article by theorist Matt Strassler in the episode description if you want a good walkthrough of this and Zero-point energy in general with a minimum of math. 

Okay, so the idea that Dark Energy is just the energy of space is a pretty popular one right now, but the evidence is hardly conclusive and there are lots of other candidates. 

I want to cover a few more and also hit on some terms you will encounter a lot if you explore this more on your own, which I hope you will, as it is one of the greatest mysteries of modern times. 

Another popular idea is that dark energy is not energy at all, but just evidence our understanding of gravity needs some more work, which is certainly true. 

While gravity was the first of the physical forces we discovered it remains arguably the worst understood one. 

We know that gravity falls off as inverse square to distance, double your distance, quarter the force of gravity, get ten times further away and it is one hundred times weaker. 

But we cannot actually be sure it precisely follows that law even at huge distances and as I mentioned in the Dark Matter episode the idea that it might get weaker at the intergalactic scale was one of the more popular explanations for dark matter though most evidence these days strongly points against that. 

We also cannot rule out that Gravity is repulsive at cosmic scales. 

Gravity is the only one of the forces with no repulsive aspect, it just attracts, and is way weaker than the other forces, electromagnetic and the weak and strong nuclear forces. 

To the best of our knowledge it is strictly attractive, and has no repulsive aspect like the other forces do. 

However, it could have a repulsive aspect at the extreme scale that results in this expansion of the universe. 

As you get further away gravity gets weaker, and if there was a repulsive force that began to get stronger as you got more distant, millions of light years or more, you would get to a point where gravity became a net repulsive force. 

Of course if that repulsive aspect did begin to dominate over the attractive aspect at large distances you would expect that to mean that as the universe got bigger and bigger the repulsive aspect would get stronger and stronger causing an accelerating expansion. 

There is absolutely no proof of this, but there’s basically no proof of much of anything to do with Dark Energy anyway. 

To get to our next one I think I should go ahead and introduce the Cosmological Constant. 

You will see this along with the Lambda CDM model a lot in discussion of it and it can get needlessly confusing. 

We use the Greek letter Lambda, for the Cosmological constant and CDM is short for Cold Dark Matter. 

So the Lambda CDM model is just the one where the Cosmological Constant is being used for Dark Energy and we assume Dark Matter is cold, we discussed why temperature matters in the Dark Matter episode. 

It is not the consensus cosmological theory, there really is not one, we just do not know enough yet to have one, but it tends to be the default one that other gets compared to. 

That this is a cosmological constant and that dark matter is real and cold, which is to say, made of particles that do not move at high velocities compared to most matter we see spinning around the galaxy. 

The Cosmological Constant is the energy density of the vacuum of space, or how much energy a given chunk of empty space has. 

We already talked today about Vacuum Energy and this is essentially that, and you will often see a version of it expressed as Omega-Lambda, which is just the ratio of the cosmological constant to the critical density of the Universe. 

The Critical Density of the Universe is defined as the density the Universe would need to be to make the Universe eventually stop expanding. 

Rather than constantly expressing that as something like 10 protons per cubic meter we just say that when Omega is exactly equal to 1 the Universe would eventually stop expanding and stay that size. 

If it is above 1 it would collapse back in on itself, the Big Crunch, and if it is less than 1 it will expand forever. 

I assume Omega was picked because of it being the last letter of the alphabet and those connotations of it spelling out the end of the universe and such. 

Omega itself would have to equal one, it is actually the sum of three terms, Omega-Mass, for classic matter and dark matter, Omega-Relativistic, for photons and neutrinos, and Omega-Lambda for the dark energy component where dark energy is the cosmological constant, or the vacuum energy of space. 

Omega-Lambda is currently estimated to be about 0.69. 

We also have the notion that Dark Energy might be some fifth fundamental force and energy, Quintessence. 

There’s more than one version of this but the general notion is that the force driving the universe apart can change with where and when you are. 

This is nice one since it predicts noticeably different results than the cosmological constant does so we should be able to say which one it is as we gather more data. 

Current evidence is not in favor of quintessence but has not ruled it out either so it deserves a mention. 

Now there are a ton more options, but those are the only ones I think we have time for today. 

Others are either a little too difficult to explain briefly or are maybe a bit too out there. 

They might be right of course but our goal today was not really to explain dark energy… we can’t yet… but to acquaint ourselves with why we think it exists and the more common terms and concepts mentioned in regard to it. 

One last common thought is using Dark Energy as a power source, as it is most of the Energy in the Universe and seems to be increasing to boot. 

It would without a doubt be an amazing power source if we could harness it. 

Better yet, since it seems to be the very energy of space, if you could for instance suck chunks of space up for their energy that would make a pretty awesome spaceship. 

You could potentially suck up some of the space in front of you, shortening the way to your destination, much like the Alcubierre Warp Drive we have discussed before. 

The one commonly suggested method would be to take a rope wrapped around an axle attached to an electrical generator and tie one end to a spaceship that goes and tows it many millions of light years away. 

Obviously this would have to be an impossibly sturdy rope. 

Once the end is that far away Dark Energy should be strong enough to keep pulling it away faster and faster, turning the generator. 

You would have to swap a new one in from time to time, tying the new rope to the end of the old one. 

Ignoring for the moment that the rope would need to be impossibly strong, I cannot personally think of any reason why this would not work. 

Which does not mean it would, I am no Cosmologist or General Relativity expert. 

Also, I would not be surprised if it turned out the mass energy of that rope turned out to exceed the energy you would gain from this. 

To the best of my knowledge though, this method would work, on paper at least. 

To seriously speculate about how to use it for power we need to understand how it works and we just do not know yet. 

It is undeniably mysterious stuff, one that may take generations to figure out, but hopefully by now you have a more down to earth view of what it might be and why cosmologists feel so confident it exists and that it is not just some crazy idea that came out of nowhere. 

I try to keep the content on the channel as down to earth as I can after all. 

Speaking of which, next week we will look at how to destroy the sun! 

[laughs] And I will actually be trying to explain how we can remove matter from stars, called Starlifting, why this might be quite down to earth and practical, and why we might do this to get a useful source of matter to build stuff with and to extend that star’s lifetime. 

and to extend that star’s lifetime. 

We will cover some of the ways this could be done and what you might be able to do with all that matter. 

This was the second winner of our Patreon Topic Contest, and we have one more which I will be picking before that episode comes out, so the deadline to enter topics for it is Saturday October 2, 2016, so you can still submit topics until then. 

The week after we will look at Cryptocurrency and Blockchain, doing both a basic introduction and looking at some interesting applications it might have in the future, along with some of the pros and cons of such things. 

That will get followed up on the October 20 with an in-depth look at the Kardashev Scale and what some of the capabilities and traits of such civilizations would be. 

Nothing is determined for after that just yet, over at the facebook group, science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, we have an on-going poll of topics and that is where most of the videos in November will be getting picked from. 

So you might want to head over there and vote for the topics you like or add new ones. 

So again, next week is Starlifitng, don’t forget to subscribe to the channel if you want alerts when that and future videos come out, and in the meantime you can try out some of the other episodes on the channel.

The Spaceship Propulsion Compendium
---
  
2016-09-22  
https://youtu.be/wXiitWK_6Qg  

---

Today’s episode, the Spaceship Propulsion Compendium, is going to be a long one, since I am going to try to touch at least briefly on every system including some of the more unlikely ones. 

I will leave out any that are just not grounded in science at all, though if I skip one do not assume that means I am including it in that category. 

Also some we have covered in more detail in other episodes so for those I will keep it brief and mostly just refer you to those episodes. 

For those of you new to the channel, if my speech impediment is giving you problems I encourage you to turn on the closed captions, it takes most folks a little bit of time to adjust to it, though by the end of this video you probably will be as again this will be a long one. 

With that in mind you also might want to grab a snack and a drink. 

I also want to add that this topic was selected from those submitted by the channels patrons over at Patreon and is the first of at least three we will do this way. 

I only committed to doing three this way but it was a lot of fun working with the first winner, Drew McTygue, who selected the topic for this episode, so I am considering making this a regular thing. 

The goal today is not to discuss basic rocket science or review the history of spacecraft, and our interest in existing propulsion methods already in regular use is minimal, but rockets made spaceships possible for one key reason that separates them from two other methods, they provide fast thrust to the ship, but at the cost of devoting virtually all the ship’s takeoff mass to fuel. 

This is because rockets do not have a very high specific impulse. 

Specific Impulse, often called effective exhaust velocity, is the total change to momentum, or speed, delivered to a ship per unit of propellant mass used. 

A rocket can deliver virtually all of that in mere seconds or minutes, making it great for clawing your way up through an atmosphere and gravity well. 

Unfortunately it means that around 90% of a ship’s take off mass is rocket fuel, just to get it a couple hundred miles up into space. 

Alternatively your car can take you a couple hundred miles off just part of a tank of gas, and a one ton vehicle usually only has 10-20 gallons of gas, or about 60 to 120 pounds or 30 to 60 kilograms more or less. 

Cars take you hundreds of miles while using less than 10% of their mass for fuel, rockets often do not get to use even 10% of their mass for payload. 

If they had a higher specific impulse, or power to mass ratio, we could carry up way more. 

Double your effective exhaust velocity and a rocket that originally weighed, say 1000 tons, 90% fuel and 10% for the rest, suddenly becomes one that is only 70% fuel and 30% for the rest. 

If you quadrupled that exhaust velocity your ship that weighed a thousand tons at launch would now not be 90% fuel but less than half fuel and more than half for the ship and its cargo. 

That is important for spaceships because you always want your highest specific impulse, or effective exhaust velocity, but most alternatives we have now that can go higher have to provide it at so slow a pace your ship could never take off, which does not mean you could not use it once you got up into space to go further. 

But our ideal space ship drive would have a very high exhaust velocity and also be able to deliver all that thrust quite quickly. 

We tend to use rocket science as synonymous with very hard things, like brain surgery, “This isn’t rocket science or brain surgery” or as one of my sergeants used to say “This isn’t rocket surgery” but of course today we are doing rocket science, and I want to emphasize it isn’t as bad as all that. 

The basic equation is simple and the really hard part is calculating all the transfer orbits and performance changes of specific fuel and rockets, we will not be looking at those today and indeed there are lots of nice online calculators you can use to do the grunt work for you. 

So that was about the only math I plan to bring up and you do not need to have followed it to follow the basic principle. 

Some of the systems we will be looking at today provide way higher exhaust velocities but take longer to do it, others provide higher velocities and just as fast as a chemical rocket. 

Now I have been asked a lot to cover the EM drive or EmDrive many time recently so I will get to that at the end so I can give it a little more time but I want warn people in advance that I am not going to be pronouncing it a working or non-working system, I am just going to be filling in some explanation of the terms and concepts involved so folks know what all this Q-cavity this and reactionless drive that stuff is talking about. 

This is a broad survey of mechanisms for space propulsion, some of which we have already covered in more detail in other episodes, not a focused in look at all of them let alone a declaration of which is best or impossible. 

It is also worth mentioning that a spaceship does not have to have a single drive, it might employ multiple types, in particular it might use different methods to take off or land. 

We have discussed launch assist options like Space Elevators, Orbital Rings, Sky Hooks, Mass Driver, Launch Loops, and Space Fountains way back at the beginning of the megastructures series. 

We have not discussed landing and braking mechanisms much so I will give a quick overview of those in a minute. 

If you want to know more about those launch assist mechanisms you can go back and check out those episodes but in summary form, rockets use a lot of fuel, and they use almost all of it getting out of our atmosphere. 

Getting a team of astronauts to Mars and back home to us uses a lot of fuel and most of that gets used up in the first few minutes getting all that into orbit. 

Fuel is also expensive, so anything that lets us get things into orbit with less fuel and energy, or let’s use do the same for ships leaving anywhere, is obviously quite handy. 

Of course once you get to your destination you have to slow down too. 

A problem not helped by both how fast you are going while making the journey and that as you approach the target, if it is massive, you will start picking up speed from its gravity. 

Good timing can arrange to help reduce your relative speed but you will always arrive with an awful lot of it. 

For Earth that is not too big a deal. 

Earth has a lot of gravity but it also has a lot of atmosphere, so we can brake our speed off the air, unsurprisingly called aerobraking. 

What is a big problem for leaving Earth, getting through all that air, is quite handy for getting back down to Earth. 

If you have a lot of speed, or the place has a thin atmosphere, you can make multiple wide elliptical orbits, passing through the upper atmosphere repeatedly, until you slow enough. 

Even on places without much air this sort of trick can work, as can more conventional concept like parachutes or hybrids of them like Ballute, a mix of a balloon and parachute. 

Of course you can also use balloons like airbags, as we did when Pathfinder landed on Mars. 

Trying to slow down after interstellar voyages at relativistic speeds can also be done using equivalents of aerobraking, in theory you can loop around a solar system using the dust in space and solar wind to slow down. 

Space is not a vacuum, even in the intergalactic void, but solar systems are much less a vacuum the interstellar space which is in turn less than intergalactic space. 

It’s not much but it would help you slow down somewhat without using as much fuel. 

And of course you need to slow down before reaching your destination or you will smash into it. 

Though lithobraking, ramming into something at high speed to stop, is also a method of landing if your ship is sturdy enough. 

Generally to save fuel and mass you can always hit with some speed and anything that saves fuel and mass is worth doing, assuming you do not overdo it and turn yourself into a pancake. 

Saving on board fuel takes us onto our next subject which is reactionless and quasi-reactionless drive. 

Now you will often hear folks say a reactionless drive is impossible but this is an oversimplification and an incorrect one unless you are careful with your definition. 

As mentioned, rockets work by spitting matter out in one direction and shoving the ship in the other, conserving momentum in the process. 

Many of the other systems we will look at work the same way, and many others are doing it by hiding the matter that is going in the opposite direction. 

For instance when I brake using the air during re-entry, momentum is all being conserved but we do not notice it since all that air goes flying away and eventually settles in as heat, with the entire planet being shoved just a little bit. 

If you jump up in the air the planet actually does go the other direction, it is just that the planet out masses you by around a 100 billion trillion, so even though you added just as much momentum to it when you jumped up as it did to you, you move up a couple feet and it in turn moves distances that would make an atom look large. 

You also do not have to lose your reaction mass in all cases, same as you don’t when jumping in the air. 

If I am standing on ice and bounce a basketball off a wall and catch it, I will be shoved the other way by tossing it then shoved again when it bounces back and I catch it. 

You can use tricks like this as a launch assist mechanism when you are near something to push things off of, and that would include laser beams. 

Light has momentum and kinetic energy, indeed that is essentially all it has. 

So bouncing stuff back and forth, be it basketballs or photons, is an example of a system essentially without propellants, or at least a propellant you can reuse, but you can only get so many bounces before it is not practical anymore and it still costs energy. 

But we also have the notion of propellants that just are not internal. 

I mentioned earlier that one of the problems with rockets is that you need more and more fuel to get to higher speeds because you have to accelerate not just the ship but the fuel you will be using to accelerate more with later and the fuel you will use to slow down. 

That is core problem of any system with an internal propellant. 

If you are pushing something with a laser generated elsewhere for instance, you do not have to pay all that extra energy to push on board fuel up to speed too. 

I will discuss this a bit more when we get to photons rockets. 

Hybrids of this, where you are carrying a propellant but the energy is coming from outside, like a ship that has solar panels it uses to heat up propellant to plasma temperatures, lets you get a lot more thrust from the same mass. 

This is the basic concept to a lot of the new propulsion concepts we will look at and the big problem is that external sources like this tend to mean you can get to a higher speed, which is great, but that it takes a long time, which means it is no good for takeoff or landing. 

Ion drives, electrodynamic tethers, or electric propulsion just does not give you the thrust you need to climb out of a steep gravity well like a planet particularly when you need to claw your way through several kilometers of air. 

This is the exact opposite of various nuclear powered drives which can often give you all the thrust you need you just do not want to use them in your own atmosphere. 

We spent a lot of time in the Interstellar Colonization video talking about Project Orion and Daedelus, which basically operate by propelling a ship by blowing up nukes behind it. 

That’s great in deep space but not for taking off from Earth. 

That is not the only nuclear option though. 

First you can just use it to power the electrical propulsion drives we will get to momentarily, but you can also use what is called a Nuclear Thermal Rocket, backwards of a Thermonuclear Bomb. 

These come in a lot of variations and are devices we have actually built and tested, and essentially you have a fission reactor that you are cooling with some substance, usually liquid hydrogen, then venting the hot hydrogen out the back. 

Thermal Rockets are themselves, nuclear or not, are a fairly classic type of propulsion. 

You externally heat some gas rather than combusting it, or in the case of a cold gas thruster are just letting something warm up and shift from being a solid or liquid into a gas, no different from putting dry ice in a bottle. 

In a nuclear thermal rocket you are just letting fission do the heating. 

They are decently more efficient than chemical rockets but usually seen as not enough to justify the additional hazards and risks. 

That is debatable but Nuclear has bad Public Relations issues and a Nuclear thermal rockets are not the safest device in the world. 

Same issue for Nuclear Electric propulsion, and that is just where nuclear is the power source. 

Electric propulsion is neither new as a concept or a technology. 

The option was kicked around by Robert Goddard over a century ago. 

They tend to offer a nice slow thrust that is good for stationkeeping and a lot of Russian satellites use this, and it is the basis for concepts like the ion drive. 

One alternative before we get to ion drives though is electrodynamic tethering. 

Way back in the Skyhooks episode I mentioned this in comments, annotations, and FAQ as a way to re-generate momentum and altitude on skyhooks but I skipped including it in the episode because I was trying for shorter episodes then and it still holds the record for shortest video on the channel. 

It is pretty novel concept though. 

Objects with powerful magnetic fields, like our planet, can be pushed off of, and while this is not a good approach for take off vehicles it works just fine for things in orbit where they just need a little thrust here and there for station keeping. 

Lots of thrust is good but often we just want small amounts that use little or no propellant. 

Which brings us to ion thrusters. 

These actually come in a lot of types but the two most well-known are HET, the Hall Effect Thruster, and VASIMR, the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, and we will focus on those two. 

But in a nutshell you are taking power, whether it is obtained from solar or nuclear power sources, and using that to speed up ions and shoot them out as your propellant. 

These are almost always very slow systems in terms of their acceleration so you would use them on things already in orbit, not to get up in orbit. 

They get up to a higher speed than a chemical rocket but take way longer to do it. 

Let us start with the Hall Effect Thruster. 

The Hall Effect was discovered by Edwin Hall of John Hopkins University way back in 1879 before we even knew what an electron was, so it is old tech and designs for using it for spacecraft propulsion go back to the early days of the Space race, but the designs were so inefficient it mostly got shelved. 

Now in a nutshell a Hall Effect Thruster uses a magnetic field to accelerate plasma up to much higher exhaust velocities than chemical rockets produces. 

It just does this as a thin trickle for days or months instead of seconds or minutes like a rocket thruster. 

No good for launch but great for interplanetary work. 

The preferred fuel is xenon, which is fairly abundant on Mars, and which we usually get on Earth, or Mars, by distilling it out of the atmosphere. 

Xenon is a good fuel because it has a high atomic weight, about 130 times hydrogen’s, and a low ionizing potential, meaning it is easy to strip an electron off so it will have a charge and respond to the electric field. 

There’s other things you can use but Xenon has numerous advantages. 

The ionization is achieved by slamming electrons off the Xenon so it knocks free an electron. 

VASIMR, the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, uses radio waves to ionize its propellant and to heat it too. 

Proposed by Franklin Chang Díaz is 1977, this system does not use an anode which is good because anodes tend to corrode quickly during use, a problem with many similar types of ion thrusters. 

It heats the propellant by radio waves, usually Xenon again though most testing is done with Argon because it is cheaper. 

In a nutshell VASIMR works off concepts developed for nuclear fusion and it heats its plasma to around a million kelvin, and it can launch those particles at speeds of up to 50 km/s, faster than other ion thrust systems. 

Unfortunately it also builds up a lot of heat. 

You can also vary the specific impulse it gives off which is handy. 

VASIMR is a very attractive system but is not without its problems, and Robert Zubrin of the Mars Society has been strongly critical of the system on several points, and one is power consumption. 

With both systems, or any of the other variants essentially running on electricity, the question is always where you get your power supply. 

Which mostly comes down to how do you squeeze the most energy out of the least mass. 

This usually excludes chemical fuels because we could just set them on fire like a classic rocket, and also batteries since we have yet to develop one that can push out as much energy per unit mass as chemical fuels. 

This leaves us solar power or nuclear power. 

Ideally a nice compact fusion reactor would be great, and we have talked about fusion a lot in previous episodes, but we do not have that yet. 

So the question is, what is better, solar or nuclear? 

The answer to this is not as obvious as it might sound like. 

In space the sun is always shining, there is no night or clouds. 

Nuclear reactors produce huge amounts of power from tiny amounts of fuel, around a million times what chemical fuels release, but they tend to be massive when you include all the equipment and shielding. 

For a ground based reactor we do not care about mass, so they are quite massive, but you could possibly get reactors potentially generating around a kilowatt per kilogram of reactor, maybe more. 

In practice, as Zubrin pointed out, the largest reactor ever put in space only produced about 10 watts per kilogram. 

Solar power on the other hand, in our general region of the sun, can do a few hundred watts per kilogram with the newest systems. 

Of course they are also more exposed to damage in space from micro-meteors since they are rather large and fragile, while a fission reactor is mostly shielding already. 

Both of these technologies have tons of rooms for improvement and it will be interesting to see who wins the race on power to mass ratio. 

If and when fusion gets made practical it would probably replace both, but we could easily see both win, after all solar gets rather ineffective the deeper you go out in space away from the sun, so you might see fission powered ion drives out there and solar nearer in. 

Ion Drives are very promising technology though especially as we improve our power to mass ratio of both solar and nuclear systems. 

Now before we get to the EM Drive, I wanted to cover some other hypothetical high-tech drive systems. 

Quite a few of these we have talked about before in greater depth, for instance we did a whole video on the Alcubierre Warp Drive in the FTL, Faster Than Light, series. 

Similarly we did a video on using artificial black holes to power starships. 

So I will just refer you to those if you are interested. 

In the episode on black hole powered starships I mentioned that they give similar performance to antimatter but are less prone to explode. 

Antimatter is often regarded as the ultimate rocket fuel, though of course it is actually a bipropellant fuel, matter and antimatter. 

Antimatter, when combined with normal matter, turns both of them into raw energy, and you could source your normal matter from the containment system for the antimatter or by sucking in random space gas. 

As fuels go, when you have to carry your fuel with you, nothing beats antimatter. 

The issues with antimatter are two-fold, production and containment. 

It currently takes huge amounts of energy to produce antimatter, orders of magnitude more than it releases, and storing it is a tricky proposition usually assumed to involve keeping it in a magnetic bottle. 

Obviously you cannot keep it in a normal bottle or it would explode when it touched the matter in the bottle. 

If you had a way to produce antimatter for similar amounts of energy to what it released, and if you could safely store it, then this is the ultimate rocket fuel and allows speeds genuinely close to the speed of light. 

Other than production and containment it is the same as any other rocket fuel too, though it is arguably a photon rocket since it is releasing its energy as photons. 

A photon rocket, sometimes jokingly called a flashlight drive, is where you are just emitting photons to push you away. 

If you drifted away from your spaceship you could use your flashlight to push you back toward it, same as you could vent some air from your tanks to push you back too. 

The problem is it take a lot of energy to do this and a battery does not have much. 

Batteries do not store as many joules of energy in them as an equal weight of gasoline for instance or other rocket fuels. 

The other problem is the produce virtually no thrust at all. 

A flashlight, say a 30 watt flashlight, and one that also radiates all that light in the same direction, produces a thrust of its power divided by the speed of light. 

Conveniently that would be 30 Watts divided by 300 Million meters per second, or one ten ten millionth of newton. 

10^-7 newtons or 100 nano newtons or .1 micronewtons. 

Now if you and your spacesuit have a combined mass of 100 kilograms, f = ma, force = mass times acceleration, or acceleration equals force divided by mass. 

10^-7 divided by 100 equals 10^-9 m/s² or a nano-meter per second second. Not very fast. If I had been drifting away at a meter per second it would take me a billion seconds, or a few decades to bring myself to a relative stop, all the while I’ve been drifting further away. Obviously my battery and oxygen ran out way before that. 

But there are two tricks of note for this. First, I don’t need any fuel on board, I can just have solar panels drinking in sunlight. Let say I had nice thin efficient solar panel of a couple square meters giving me 3000 watts of power out of my bigger flashlight, and the whole thing only weighed a kilogram. One hundred times the power as our last example pushing one hundredth of the mass, that gives me 10,000 times the acceleration. Now that is not as bad. After a few decades you are not going one meter per second but 10 kilometers per second. Some of you might be saying now, “Hey, why even bother with solar panels and a flashlight, why not just use a mirror? You could make that even thinner and not even need the flashlight?” and that is true, except it’s even better since when light hits and reflects off something you get double the effect. So a very thin mirror being hit by sunlight has a much higher acceleration than the flashlight since you can use all that mass as just simple thin mirrors, getting more light, and getting double the push from it. You can also bounce that light at an angle to produce thrust in different directions. But that’s not the end of it, because we could bounce more than once. Sort of like our earlier example where we bounced a basketball off the wall then caught it and threw it again, just with light instead. If I have a nice reflective surface, and a laser with a reflective surface around it to, I can shine that laser on the first mirror which bounces it back to the mirror around the laser which bounces it back to the first mirror and so on. A spaceship and some space station bouncing a laser back and forth between them could get that ship up to a pretty good speed if you can keep that beam contained, which of course gets harder and harder the more times it bounces and the further apart they get from scattering and diffusion, plus each bounce takes longer. But such a thing as a launch assist system has some possibilities, and we explored laser and light propulsion in the Interstellar Colonization and Nicoll-Dyson Beam episodes in more detail. I discussed there the notion of a laser highway between solar systems where you have many stations along the way using fusion to power themselves and bouncing laser off ships as they passed by, possibly back and forth a few times if you can aim and focus the reflected laser well enough. 

Now if we have the ability to alter either what the physical constants are, like gravity, or make them not work symmetrically, say gravity that emitted like a cone not a sphere, other options become available. Imagine for the moment that a large and massive object did not emit gravity in all direction but just in one direction. Something like a gravity flashlight or laser. We have no idea how to do such things yet and maybe never will, but it may be possible in the future. Certain hypothetical materials, like negative matter, a type of exotic matter we have discussed before in the Faster Than Light Series, could let us achieve such effects or equivalent ones. These sort of ideas are used for concepts like the Diametric Drive or Pitch or Bias Drives. These are totally hypothetical craft relying on science we do not have yet but I feel they deserve a mention. 

Lastly we have the idea of picking up fuel in route, gathering up either space gas or dark matter to use as fuel. This is the basic idea of the Bussard Ramjet, which we discussed in the Interstellar Colonization episode, and for how to refuel a black hole powering a spaceship, which we discussed in Black Hole Spaceships. Using Dark Matter as a potential fuel is something we looked at in the Dark Matter episode and has to be classified as totally hypothetical since we still do not know the properties of Dark Matter or any way to manipulate it, but we discussed it more in that episode if you are curious. 

Okay, on to the EM Drive at last. I saved this one till the end so we could spend a bit more time on it since it is a big news item with an awful lot of confusing and often contradictory reporting. It hit the news again recently when someone said that NASA would be releasing a peer-reviewed paper on it. At the time of this episode that paper has not been confirmed to be released, let alone released, but the assumption it was being released is what rekindled interest. Now the EM drive, or just EmDrive, is often called a radio frequency, or RF, resonant cavity thruster. Its sibling device, the Cannae Drive or Q-Drive works off the same concept. This is a type of electromagnetic thruster in which electromagnetic radiation, photons, are confined to a microwave cavity, and provides thrust to the cavity in a particular direction as the radiation reflects within the cavity. 

Now what is a Microwave cavity? Well basically a box with mirrors inside that reflect that frequency of radiation, in this case microwaves. You probably have one in your kitchen, a microwave oven is a simple microwave cavity. There are two special notes about this though. 

First, a terminology one. Whenever we discuss cavities you will hear people refer to its Q-Factor, and irritatingly most do not bother explaining what this mundane thing is so many folks assume it is some weird physics thingy. A Q-Factor is just short for Quality Factor, and it basically measures how good the cavity is at keeping the waves bouncing around inside it rather than dissipating as heat. It isn’t quite as simple as just saying that a perfectly reflective mirror would have infinite Q, but for basic conceptual purposes it amounts to how good a reflector the cavity is. That’s important since as I mentioned back when we were discussing reflecting lasers repeatedly, every time you can get it to bounce you get more thrust imparted. So higher Q is good, it is also very hard to get from a practical standpoint when you are trying to dump tons of power into a cavity. Something with really high Q would make an excellent battery for instance. You could just keep dumping more and more microwaves in and lose very little of it to heat dissipation. 

Now the other difference is that these kind of cavities are usually cylinders, for the EmDrive though it is a tapered cylinder, wider on one side than the other, and the basic notion is that the wider end will get more force exerted on it, generating a net thrust. 

Now in principle this device produces thrust, but it does not seem to have any sort of propellant, which would make it violate conservation of momentum. Remember even our laser or solar sail drives use photons as their propellant. The EM drive is not supposed to be emitting any, just bouncing them around inside. So this drive got dismissed as total nonsense by most until one got built by NASA and seemed to produce some thrust. 

Now it wasn’t much thrust, so little it might even be noise, and actually less than you would get by shining a flashlight using the same power. Indeed there is a concern that it is just asymmetrically emitting radiation, again like a flashlight, since it is hardly a nice symmetric sphere. At this point many would say “Okay, so even if it does produce thrust, it is less than a flashlight or laser, so what good is it?”. 

Fair point, BUT, it would still be interesting until we knew how it was producing any thrust and the notion is that this device does not necessarily scale its thrust linear to its power. By which I mean, if we double the power to it we would expect to get more than double the thrust. So you would next say, “Why have we not just done that then, this experiment was only using around a kilowatt of power, why not throw in 10 kilowatts, or a 100, and see what happens?” The simple answer is that high Q-factor cavities than can also handle tons of power without melting are very, very hard to make. Which obviously also means very expensive. 

Now a few more notes. First, the EmDrive is not the quite the same as the Cannae Drive, but the two get used synonymously a lot so you should probably treat them that way when reading about either one, because folks use them interchangeably. Second, it is in no way a warp drive. That was just bad reporting. Eagleworks is NASA’s department for looking at novel and sometimes fringe propulsion systems, headed up by Sonny White, so they are always looking at various strange systems and Sonny White also examined the Alcubierre Warp Drive around then and lots of bad reporting jumbled them together. If you see an article talking about EmDrive and warp drive, you can pretty much just skip it. Either the author is using a clickbait title or they didn’t do their research, so either way it probably is not worth your time. I get asked for my opinion on the EmDrive a lot and personally I do not expect it to actually work. Or if it does then the thrust will turn out to be something quirky where it is being provided by photons leaving the drive but interfering with each other so we have problems detecting them or bouncing off Quantum Vacuum Plasma, or a Q-Thruster, where in this case the Q is for Quantum not Quality. 

Sonny White tossed that notion out there as an option but the idea of Virtual Plasma, as a type of Virtual particles which we have discussed before, is not too popular with theoretical physicist at the moment. Fundamentally we are at the wait and see stage, nobody has gone and proved the EmDrive works, that is just sensationalist journalism, but nobody has successfully killed it yet either. I would not suggest holding your breath it will work but I would say it is still on the table for now. 

That is true of a lot of the systems we have discussed today, and hopefully at least one of those will turn out to be both possible and practical so we can replace chemical rockets. 

I think we are justified in being optimistic and putting some faith in human ingenuity, but we also always want to keep our exuberance dampened and scientific. 

As I’ve said before, there is a big difference between proper skepticism and naysaying, as well as just trusting to science as a magic wand. It can often seem like propulsion technology is proceeding at a snail’s pace and sensationalist journalism constantly reporting every new theory like it was proven fact can make a person pretty jaded, but we are making good and constant progress. For my part I am very optimistic about that progress, if properly skeptical too, and while we could only cover the basics here you should have a good place to continue your own research into these. I’ll be placing several links in the episode’s description to good places like Project Rho to either follow up on these or get more specific data, but this is where we end for today. 

Some quick announcements. First I wanted to thank Drew McTygue, he was the first winner of our Patreon subject selection and chose today’s topic. We spent a lot of time on the phone discussing what to cover and what to bypass for time constraints and we worked on the script together which was a lot of fun, and I’m looking forward to future collaborations with folks on such topics. Next, we have our second winner for a topic. 

That topic is going to be Star Lifting, and that winner was Bill Mains, so congratulations to Bill and that was an excellent topic pick and one I have been considering covering for a while. Star lifting is term given to various hypothetical processes for lifting matter of stars, as the name implies. This has quite a few possibilities and uses, the two most obvious being that 99% of the matter in our solar system is in our star, so it is create source for matter, and secondly, that you can use this process to extend the lifetime of a star. We will look at that and some other awesome things you can do with star lifting when that episode comes out on October 6th, 2016. 

That will be after we take a look at Dark Energy next week, and that will be followed by a look at Cryptocurrency and BlockChain, then get followed by a look at the Kardashev Scale on the 20th, that topic was selected by a poll over on our new Facebook group, Science &amp; Futurism with Isaac Arthur which Drew is now a moderator for too. I want to thank everyone who came over and joined that last week and everyone who volunteered to moderate and administrate it, and we will be selecting a lot of our topics by polls conducted over there and topics selected there from now on, as it is a better place to discuss the ideas. This week though, while I’d encourage you to join the Facebook group, we are also launching the identically titled Sub-Reddit Science &amp; Futurism with Isaac Arthur so I will be over there after this episode comes out answering questions and I hope you will join us on both. We will have one more Patreon Topic selection in a few more weeks so it is not too late to join and submit topic suggestions over there, and indeed I am considering doing it more in the future. You can opt to submit anonymously if you do not want to me saying who you were during the videos but I prefer to be able to say who’s idea it was and to be able to sit down on the phone and discuss the idea with the person who submitted it, that won’t affect whether or not the topic gets selected but do let me know if you do not want your name used, or want a pen name used, or are not comfortably chatting about the idea on the phone. That third episode will probably come out in Early November. Again, next week we will look at Dark Energy, and clear up some of the confusion about this mysterious force that seems to be shoving the Universe apart. Until then you can try out some of the other episodes on the channel or at the website, IsaacArthur.net, or follow me on facebook or twitter or reddit, and if you enjoyed this episode, make sure to like it and share it with others. 

Thanks for joining me today and until next time, have a great day!

Self Replicating Machines

2016-09-15  
https://youtu.be/V-96C4ExhWM

Today’s topic is self-replicating machines, particularly von Neumann Probes and Berserkers. 

We will be looking at the basic concept of self-replicating machines and some misconceptions about them, then moving in to discuss those two specific types of them and some others. 

There’s also three things we should clear up about self-replicating machines straight from the outset. 

First, Self-Replicating machines do not have to be small. 

Second, we are arguably capable of making one right now. 

Third, Self-Replicating Machines are not necessarily just machines, they can be alive. 

Now in fiction self-replicating machines are usually implied to be small, tiny little nano-robots, but they hardly have to be, nor do nano-robots need to be self-replicating. 

They are also usually portrayed as essentially a single type, when you could easily have swarms of them composed of many sub-types and sizes. 

Often if something larger is desired they just clamp together to make it, but that’s not actually a good approach. 

For instance if we want metal to make more of the little buggers we could send them in to go remove individual atoms of metal from dirt, which is a regular portrayal but kind of silly, or we could have them form into a conventional kiln to smelt metal, which is also pretty silly especially considering the whole point of the kiln is to smelt the very metal they are made out of, and so them too. 

It would make a lot more sense to have them just build a kiln, so this is our first strike against the classic concept of grey goo, some swarm of robots that looks like goo while eating up planets. 

The original concept for this is usually in John von Neumann’s concept of a Universal Assembler or Constructor, something Drexler followed up with as a Molecular Assembler which is pretty much where all the concepts for nano-machines come from. 

But self-replicating machines way predate that, to at least the time of Rene Descartes, who apparently told Her Majesty Christina of Sweden that the human body was a machine. 

The queen, being quite the scholar herself, apparently pointed at a clock and told him to make it reproduce. 

Then not long after Darwin’s notions began circulating Samuel Butler toyed with the notion of self-replicating machines mutating and evolving consciousness. 

So this concept is a good deal older than people tend to think and did not focus on tiny machines. 

On the second point, that we could probably make one now, that size concept is important. 

If I have some automated factory rolling around eating up rock and spitting out new fully equipped factories that is still a self-replicating machine. 

A 3D printer able to print itself is a self-replicating machine as well. 

It need not be able to make its own construction material though. 

After all, you and I are self-replicating machines and we not only do not typically convert matter into food directly ourselves but actually use a lot of integrated but independent life forms to keep ourselves alive. 

We don’t just eat other organisms, we have lots of little buggers hanging around in our guts helping us digest them. 

We even have mitochondria in every cell of our body that reproduce themselves using their own genetic code. 

Useful hitchhikers for eons who we’ve formed a genuinely symbiotic relationship with even though we do not actually have code for them in our DNA. 

So a giant factory that replicated itself for instance would still be a self-replicating machine even if it had other self-replicating machines inside it that it was dependent on but did not actually make itself. 

Since we are comparing them to organisms, let us examine that claim that self-replicating machines are alive. 

Now there is no universally agreed upon definition for life but generally we would include the ability to eat, grow, excrete, replicate, and to adapt to and interact with its environment. 

The reason it is often hard to nail down a solid definition is that almost any of those can be done away with while leaving a valid claim to life, at least in theory, but that is an important qualifier when we are discussing building and tinkering with life. 

I have never seen a definition for life that comfortably contains all the normal examples but which would also exclude a self-replicating machine, though it might exclude some types of them. 

And I do not mean in a sort of vague way like we might say fire is alive or crystals are alive. 

This is not semantics, the typical self-replicating machine we envision would have some ability to eat, replicate of course, and have some equivalent to DNA it used for that. 

Now it need not necessarily have the ability to grow or repair itself, so long as it is able to make another full-grown copy of itself in decently less time than it usually takes for it to breakdown. 

Biological organisms do not use that method, of just manufacturing something separate and fully-grown, they get bigger and subdivide into two or make small copies of themselves that grow up. 

A self-replicating machine could be built to do the same but it has that third option to construct a fully grown version too. 

But a self-replicating machine does need a blueprint to work off of, same as any other organism, and rather than invent a new term or just say machine DNA, I will just call this DNA even though it would almost certainly not be DNA in most cases. 

In some it might be. 

After all quick path to self-replicating tiny machines is just tweaking the DNA or RNA of existing cells or viruses to do a job. 

GMOs, genetically modified organisms, are an example of self-replicating machines, and again something we have now. 

So this brings up what we use these for. 

What is their task or mission? 

Obviously they do not have to have one besides copying themselves but a machine is built with a purpose in mind. 

Now you could use such devices for any number of things but the two big ones tend to be use off the planet or use inside a human being or other complex device. 

This is because the most appealing quality of them is that they can help repair things, like help a human heal from injury or fix a piece of equipment so you did not need to throw it out or take it in for repairs. 

That’s very handy for things like space probes since it means you could send a probe out at relatively slow speed and expect it to still be working when it arrived at its destination solar system thousands of years later. 

Now before proceeding I want to go ahead and kill the common myth that self-replicating machines invariably mutate. 

We mutate, other organisms mutate, and indeed a bunch of little robots could too, but they do not necessarily have to. 

Even on astronomical timelines. 

Mutation is an absolute necessity for evolving from that most simple organism that presumably once assembled itself into more complex ones, but mutation is not a desirable trait if you are building to a specific purpose. 

I do not want my probe heading off to the Andromeda Galaxy to mutate in the millions of years it takes to arrive. 

If I hand someone a book and tell them to copy it word for word we know they will fail at that task, they will make a couple mistakes, and if they hand that to someone else that person will probably copy those mistakes while making a few new ones, and so on until you get a copy that is just nothing like the original. 

That is mutation. 

If that is my only way of copying and preserving data, say I am some old king and I want to make sure my scribes maintain my memoirs properly, I can order three copies made of my memoir by three different scribes, that way if the original is destroyed they can compare those three copies word by word and if they come across a word that is different in one than in the other two, they know it was probably the two that are correct not the one, and can fix that. 

Of course it is always possible those two scribes made the same error, or that all three copies disagree, but both of those events are less likely. 

They are still likely enough though that it can happen and with potentially millions of lines of code and millions of copying events you would often get two identical errors or spots where all three disagreed. 

If you add in a fourth copy, these odds decrease. 

If you add in five or six it gets even less likely, and you can increase that to the point where while it is still possible, the odds of it happening even once over the age of the entire Universe is less likely than not. 

So for instance I could have a setup so that to make a new machine it required multiple machines to get together, just as with sexual reproduction but more polygamous, as it were. 

Say, twenty other ones had to assemble together into a dodecahedron, a platonic solid with twelve faces and 20 vertices, with each at one vertex, and they’d build the new one in the middle. 

Before adding each new bit they check and agree. 

If all twenty agree on a given chunk of the blueprint, all is well. 

If not, then the odds of less a majority of them having the right bit are freakishly tiny. 

We have done these kinds of extreme improbabilities before but the brain does not tend to work well with them and I am sure some of you are thinking right now, “Sure, but it is still a chance so it will happen”. 

This is technically true but reaches a point of absurdity when you begin dealing with improbabilities so high that they would be less likely than not to occur if every atom in the Universe were turned into the things and we sat around waiting until the stars all burned out. 

So you could for instance tell every machine it needed to match back up with 19 of its buddies once a year for a check where they compare data, or to shut down if they can’t find 19. 

You could also have all sorts of different species and protocols for dealing with unexpected events, and you can always ‘what if’ your way into some bizarre circumstance but that’s not really the point. 

You might want your robots to mutate, you might not, but if you want to send your robots off somewhere confident they won’t mutate before arriving, that is an option. 

This one of the objections to what is called a von Neumann probe, so I wanted to clear that up before jumping in. 

John von Neumann came up with the idea of universal assemblers, often just called von Neumann machines or Grey Goo, and this sparked 5 major concepts for how this might be used in regards to deep space. 

One is the basic version and I’ll just call that a von Neumann Probe even though the others are too, here are those 5 categories. 

1) Von Neumann Probe 2) Bracewell Probe 3) Terraforming Swarm 4) Berserker Swarm 5) Grey Goo Swarm A basic von Neumann Probe is simply an interstellar probe able to maintain itself with little robots and stop over place to repair, refuel, and reproduce copies of itself to explore more places. 

Now in practice if it can self-repair this way you’re better off launching all your probes from our own solar system. 

Even if you needed to budget a hundred tons for each probe, about ten times what the Hubble telescope masses, you could still get away with manufacturing a trillion of them, more than the number of stars in the galaxy, with the available mass of just one medium-large asteroid. 

Those could all go cruising off from our solar system and arrive at their destination far sooner than if you send out a handful of probes that slow down at the nearest stars, build more, launch those, which slow down again to build more, and so on. 

You’d be better off using that automated production ability to have a small probe arrive, grab a small asteroid, and convert it into a bigger monitoring station that can also act as a relay for information from ones further out. 

Now the second type, the Bracewell Probe, you would be most familiar with from the movie 2001. 

The monoliths in that were Bracewell Probes. 

A Bracewell Probe is designed to communicate with other life forms, so it needs to be a good deal smarter and more adaptable. 

The most simple form would just be one that was able to self-repair and identify planets with a decent probability of life, and then setup shop nearby there and sat around transmitting a repeating radio loop of how to make contact with us and some basic info about us. 

Sort of giant flashing neon sign saying hello, here’s our phone number along with a Rosetta stone for how to talk to us. 

Typically this is envisioned as a human-level or greater intelligence though. 

Something with actual brains and decision-making capability. 

Now technically a Bracewell probe doesn’t have to be a von Neumann machine but considering the timelines for interstellar travel and how long it might need to wait when it arrived, you would need to be building the components unbelievably tough to expect it to survive for those kind of duration without the repair capability of either being a self-replicating machine or able to make use of them to fix itself. 

Also again it is probably more advantageous to ship these all out from our own solar system and just have them unpack and build themselves on arrival at the target. 

This has the advantage that it could set itself up on some small asteroid and send in satellite surveillance and even ground probes to collect data. 

Or make contact rather than have to sit around broadcasting. 

If it can manufacture on site and has human level intelligence it could pick up enough data to send in androids that looked like the hypothetical primitive young race of aliens and chatted. 

For instance someone doing this to Earth centuries ago might start with satellite surveillance, then stealthy aerial drones, then little android birds or mice for close looks and to get the language and customs observed, then send in an android to ask questions it could not get from just listening and watching, or to give them information. 

Obviously you could take that into the ethically grey realm of trying to teach them or pretending to be a god. 

Incidentally both of these approaches work just fine for building manned spaceships too. 

You can build larger spaceships for people to be on with self-replicating machines helping in the building and maintenance but the assumption is you can always build these automated versions cheaper and faster, both in terms of construction time and their velocity in interstellar space. 

Now a Terraforming Swarm is essentially the notion that you are sending out von Neumann probes in advance to scout places for human settlement and that those probes either have terraforming capability or would be followed up by ones that did and followed up by manned ships later. 

The probe arrives at the destination and sets to work expanding itself so it can take on terraforming a planet. 

Or even turning the entire solar system into habitats as we have discussed before when talking about Dyson Spheres. 

This is another morally grey one because if you do not include an intelligence in that Terraforming Probe it might just go and terraform an inhabited planet, cheerfully disassembling the local flora and fauna in the process. 

That would seem pretty ghastly even if there was no intelligence on those planets, on the other hand you might think it was fine to Terraform a place that only had amoeba on it. 

Individual views range from this being wrong only if there was intelligent life to it being wrong even if there was a decent possibility life might arise on that planet one day. 

Of course some might feel it is fine even if it had intelligent life on it. 

The Berserker is usually seen as something a civilization might build if it had those kind of views, or made a terrible mistake. 

The name comes from a series of novels by Fred Saberhagen where the robotic ships or probes explore the galaxy to seek out new lifeforms and blow them up. 

The ones from the series are not actually von Neumann machines individually but the collective whole was. 

A Berserker is essentially a malevolent Bracewell Probe, in that the Bracewell Probe’s mission is to seek out new life and meet it, the Berserker Probe is to seek it out and kill it, and our last type, grey goo, just wants to eat it. 

Grey Goo is occasionally called a Hegemonic Swarm, which I think originated from author Iain M. Banks. 

This doesn’t have to be robots or tiny little machines, the specific grey goo case, so I will use Hegemonic Swarm as a maybe more appropriate term. 

This could be grey goo, where self-replicating machines just fling themselves across the void stopping at stars and turning all the matter into more of themselves, but it could also apply to something like the Borg from Star Trek or a crazy machine intelligence that has decided it needs to turn the whole Universe into paperclips. 

Alistair Reynolds even had a particular variety of this in one of his books that began as a terraforming swarm and through bad design was racing around turning everything into habitats around a star, into Dyson Swarms basically, already filled with flora and fauna, but was attacking colonized planets and spaceships too, to add them to the habitats. 

This is one of the reasons I wanted to take some time on the mutation issue because it is often assumed any self-replicating probes would turn into Berserker Armadas, Grey Goo, or Hegemonizing Swarms given enough time to mutate. 

Once genuine mutation is in play, especially on machines that were not sentient, it is reasonable to assume they would start mutating toward strictly Darwinian goals like survival and replication. 

From that comes an assumption that left loose to run around the galaxy unsupervised for long times most of the nice and benign or helpful types of these von Neumann machines will turn all evil. 

So it worth remembering there are ways to prevent mutation, but something often overlooked is that mutation does not change something from A to B, it turns A into a whole alphabet and then a library, given enough time. 

There is a reason right now that even though my billions of times great grandfather was an amoeba I am sitting here at the moment, and there’s also a reason why there are still tons of tiny and simple micro-organisms. 

So you would expect a runaway mutating self-replicating machine to result in a whole ecosystem. 

At the solar system level you would expect to see the bottom of the food chain probably be self-replicating machines that swarmed in the trillions around a star sucking up its light then other things which came by and ate them and got eaten in return. 

Probably complete with detritus eating versions at the far end of the food chain and ones swimming around Kupier Belt grabbing comets and small asteroids freshly arrived from deeper out. 

Such things are not an example of machine life, they are just an example of life, its kind of silly to think of it any other way at that point. 

And it is worth remembering that is how life began on Earth too. 

Our planet did get gray-goo’d by those earliest life forms and probably more than once. 

I occasionally find it amusing to think of intelligent life as an adaptation of grey goo to produce a new wave of it that can leave an atmosphere or solar system, since classic evolutionary processes do not lend themselves to those kind of jumps. 

Okay some final notes about self-replicating machine and nano-machines in general. 

I already mentioned that mutation does not have to be an automatic feature of these, but with that reminder that we basically descend from grey goo I should address the misconception some get that tiny little robots swarming around can just disassemble whole planets in days. 

I mentioned speed limits a couple videos back where 3D printing machines are concerned and tiny little robots have them too. 

Just for conceptual purposes, keep in mind that bacteria can reproduce quite quickly compared to us, often able to double on a timeline of an hour or so. 

Meaning if you start with one you could have a million the next day and a trillion the next day and a quintillion the day after that. 

On paper anyway, in practice exponential growth tends to get dampened by other effects. 

However there is a clear evolutionary advantage to being able to grow and replicate quicker, and to be as omnivorous as possible about your sources of food and fuel. 

Yet bacteria do not split in two every second, even the fastest viruses, which are incredibly simple critters if they are organisms at all, are not that fast. 

Complexity has a cost, it takes longer to assemble. 

Now a machine should be designable that does replicate faster than biological life, but it is not very likely to be many orders of magnitude faster than organisms of the same size. 

It is also worth remembering that chemistry and construction tend to produce a lot of heat, there is a reason bread dough or compost or other things bacteria go nuts in tend to get hot. 

You can only go so fast replicating before the heat would get so bad it destroyed the machines doing it. 

It is also a lot harder to snatch and place molecules in something you are building when it is hot and all the molecules are bouncing around much faster and also bouncing into whatever you are building. 

We tend to forget that at the molecular level hotter temperatures mean stuff moving quickly, but building at that scale in a hot environment would be like trying to pitch a tent in the middle of a hailstorm. 

Heat, as we have seen in a lot of our topics on this channel, tends to be a big bottleneck on a lot of processes. 

You also have to remember that tiny things are very fragile and that each component adds more material, more time to build it, and slows the process. 

How are your tiny little robots getting power? 

Solar energy? 

Not very useful for anything but the surface layer when its sunny and a solar panel can only be so thin before it would be incredibly fragile. 

You are not getting a nuclear power source, fusion or fission, that small. 

That just is not how that works. 

That leaves either battery power, which it needs to go recharge somewhere and could get quite bulky, or using existing fuel in whatever it is disassembling. 

That is great for medical nanotechnology, you can design it to run off your own power supply in your cells, but tiny and universal chemical fuel eaters are not exactly doable. 

You would almost have to give it a separate engine for each type of fuel supply so it could run on oxygen and methane in one place, solar in another, sugar in another, etc. 

Adds more complexity, adds more bulk, adds more replication time. 

Want to shield it from an EMP blast? 

Add shielding, adding more bulk and more replication time. 

Also slows down how quickly it can do other things since it uses more energy to move its greater bulk and has more of its mass devoted to things other than moving and assembling and disassembling things. 

Want it smarter, more material, more energy, slower replication times. 

Probably a lot faster than biological life but not likely to be superfast. 

Scale always been hard on people, lots of folks think your typical biological cell is made up of atoms and molecules like they were LEGO bricks, in practice cells do not have dozen of atoms or hundreds or thousands, they tend to have trillions. 

If you’re thinking of atoms or small molecules as building bricks of cells, don’t picture a house, which has several thousand bricks, picture a major metropolis, or even an entire planet, that’s the scale of most cells compared to atoms and simplest molecules. 

Even a typical virus tends to be in the hundreds of thousands, more akin to a skyscraper than a house. 

Your average mammal like a human or a puppy would be more like a galaxy in this atom equals brick analogy. 

So yes you could build machines that were quite tiny compared to bacteria, probably were pretty sturdy, versatile, clever, and fast to reproduce but we do not want to get carried away and think of them as invincible swarms of grey goo moving over a planet like a tidal wave or possessing magic powers. 

We also want to remember they could come in a lot of sizes, from on par with a virus to quite larger than a person. 

So when will we have these? 

I would guess quite soon, again we arguably already have them and it’s an important area of research. 

Automated construction, both for factories and for use in space, would be very useful, and is already very useful. 

At the microscopic scale the medical applications are huge and so is the convenience angle of having colonies of specialized tiny robots that hung around our appliances fixing them, particularly since you can make things smaller if they do not have to be durable enough to survive minor damage which could instead be repaired. 

You’ve got two options on something like that too, you don’t have to have the machines able to self-replicate, you could have them without that and produced somewhere and you buy a vial of non-replicating ones with an expiration date. 

Back at the factory for them slightly bigger machines churn out millions of the tiny ones constantly, which is advantageous since you can save mass and energy by making them more specialized and without all the extra bits for reproduction and have some smarter bigger control bots that can issue them orders. 

They’d probably be more like a solution of various species of nanobot. 

Ditto you could still go the replication route just have that done a couple steps up, with smarter bacteria sized mobile factories that built them as needed and could get updates and issue updates. 

Lot of potential uses and a big game changing technology. 

One I suspect most of us will live to see, but also not a magic wand or instant doomsday device. 

Their value for medicine is huge, potentially making us biologically immortal, and their value for space exploration and colonization is equally huge. 

That leads to our topic for next week, Spacecraft Propulsion, where we will be doing a quick survey of all sorts of spaceship propulsion ideas either in use now or on the drawing board, including the EM drive. 

That topic was selected by Drew McTygue, the first winner of the topic contest we had over on the Patreon account for this channel. 

I’ll be drawing the second winner in a few days on Sept 20th, coincidentally my birthday, so you can still go over to Patreon, become a channel patron, and submit a topic which will follow Dark Energy, our poll winner from last week, and either come right before or after Crypto-currency, the runner up, depending on how much time I need to develop that topic. 

Incidentally we will be shifting all future polls to the channel’s new facebook group, Science &amp; Futurism with Isaac Arthur, and those will now be ongoing and we will have one set of polls to suggest ideas and another to pick the winner from the most popular, and again that will just be getting constantly updated. 

Since this is the debut week for that facebook group, I will be hanging out there the day this video comes out to answer questions, though I’m quite active on facebook normally anyway. 

My thanks to all the folks who agreed to help mod and admin that, since that lets me leave it a lot freer for general discussion of other subjects too like other channels you like or general discussion of science and science fiction. 

I do get asked a lot what other channels I watch and its mostly comedy and scifi on youtube, science-wise I have a few recommended channels on my channel page for Joe Scott, Grant Thompson the King of Random, and Cody Don Reeder from Cody’s Lab, Cody in particular has given me some great advice in the last couple weeks on running the channel for which I’m quite grateful, but more importantly he makes some great science videos, so I’d suggest checking them out if you haven’t already. 

There’s not nearly enough science, I mean real science, out there on this medium and it’s nice to see other folks trying to correct that too. 

Last note, there is now a sub-reddit for the channel though we will be launching that officially next week to give Tim a bit more time to polish it up and let me focus on the new facebook group this week, and of course you can follow me on Twitter, visit the website, IsaacArthur.net, listen or download the audio-versions of the episodes from Soundcloud, or find me on patreon. 

Again next week is Spaceship Propulsion Concepts, followed by Dark Energy, and I hope you will swing by a join the facegroup page, say hi, and vote in the episode polls and stop by to do that regularly. 

Until next time, thanks for watching, and have a great day!

Technological Singularity

So Today’s topic is Technological Singularities, the idea that an increase in intelligence beyond the human norm, either in the form of a computer intelligence or a heightened human intelligence, might trigger an accelerating chain of subsequent improvements to intelligence until you end up with something as intelligent to modern humans as humans are to ants. 

This is a big topic, one we cannot cover in total in one episode, so let’s establish our goals for today. 

Here is what we need to discuss: 1) What is a Technological Singularity? 

2) How realistic is one? 

3) Is one inevitable? 

4) Is it a good thing? 

Those will be the key points for today. 

Mixed in with that we will aim to clear up some misconceptions about this concept and some bad thinking. 

And wow, is there a lot of that. 

While the basic concept has a lot of merit I have seen approaches to this topic that would make cult members stop drinking their Kool-Aid long enough to tell the folks to chill out because they are getting kind of creepy. 

This is a lot like Transhumanism, which we discussed before. 

There is a nice sane group of folks who want to advance technologies to improve physical and mental health of people, hopefully beyond the normal human constraints, and there is a group of folks who think getting an LED light implanted under their skin by someone without a medical degree is somehow advancing that cause. 

The latter gives the former a bad name and the same applies to what are called Singularitarians. 

There’s the rational type and the type who seem to have gone a bit overboard. 

The basic line of reason of this concept is as follows. 

Computers are getting faster and faster, you ought to be able to eventually run something as smart as a human on one and one a bit smarter than a human too, which ought to be able to make one even smarter, and in less time, which can make a smarter one in an even shorter time, which does it again. 

It might be improving itself or making a new mind, doesn’t matter. 

Some would say that once you get that first better than human mind the process proceeds over just mere years, other think you would flick one on and ten minutes later you have got a very literal Deus Ex Machina on your hands. 

And they might be right. 

Our goal today is definitely not to prove they are wrong. 

What we are doing today is going to be looking at a lot of bad arguments used in favor of this position and a lot of the criticisms of the concept and also a lot of the flaws in some of those criticisms. 

We are, in a nutshell, going to clear away a lot of the tangled nonsense surrounding this concept. 

So let us go ahead and list out the key postulates of a Technological Singularity so we can do this methodically. 

1) Computers are getting faster 2) The rate at which computers are getting faster is accelerating 3) We can make a computer better than a human mind 4) That computer can make a computer smarter than itself 5) That next computer can make an even smarter computer and faster than the last step 6) This cycle will continue until you get to a singularity. 

Now we could spend a whole video on each of these. 

I should know, I tossed out the first draft of this video when I caught myself spending 20 minutes on postulate #1, the most solid of the group. 

We don’t need to spend that much time on them. 

#1 is easy, we know computers are getting faster but we also know that could stop tomorrow. 

We often have new technologies progress at fast rates for a generation or two after their discovery, or some new major advancement, then plateau out. 

Heck it has literally happened not just with many major technologies before but computers themselves. 

I have mentioned in the past that computer used to be a job, well we have also had computers for a long time including simple analog ones all the way back to Ancient Greece. 

They got way faster when we invented the vacuum tube, the thing that made older television so thick, which made computers much faster and more viable. 

Then we discovered semiconductors and got transistors and had a second wave of expansion. 

We have just about maxed out what we can do with transistors in the lab, and manufacturing them in bulk is quite hard too. 

So we shouldn’t go assuming they will always get faster. 

Realistically that would not make sense anyway. 

We can only make transistors so small, they use semiconductors and that is a specific effect caused by mixtures of atoms, you cannot go smaller than that. 

We might find an alternative to transistors, same as we found them as an alternative to vacuum tubes, but we cannot take that as a given, and honestly it is just wishful thinking to assume we can always make computers just a little faster forever and ever. 

Postulate #2 is basically Moore’s Law, usually paraphrased that computers will double in speed every two years, though it actually speaks to the density of transistors on circuit. 

Its own big flaw is that Moore’s Law is dead. 

It got declared dead at the beginning of the year in dozens of articles and papers. 

Moore himself said back in 2005 he expected it to die by 2025. 

And it actually died way back in the 70’s. 

See when Gordon Moore first noted this increase it was 1965 and he said it would double every year, in 1975 he sliced that down to every other year because it had not done that. 

And it has never, ever followed anything like a smooth curve. 

It just looks that way when you graph it logarithmically and cherry pick your data points. 

The Postulate is sort of true, because computers have kept getting faster at a rate that is exponential, but you could use that same reasoning on the stock market or any number of other things which generally grow. 

#3 is actually probably the solidest. 

Computers might not keep getting faster forever and the rate of growth might not continue as fast but we can conclude that it ought to be possible to eventually get a computer that could outperform a human brain across the board. 

After all the brain is a machine and while an amazingly complex and efficient one we can see a lot of little way we could do it better if we could start from scratch and use other materials. 

We cannot say for sure if it will actually be possible to build and teach a computer as smart as a person for less effort than growing a person, but the odds look good on this, we do not have any reason to think it cannot be done. 

#4 is okay too. 

If we can build a computer smarter than ourselves, then it should be able to do the same. 

Eventually. 

And probably with the help of many other computers like itself. 

After all, I have never built a super-human intellect. 

I have never spent a weekend in my shed hammering one together. 

And you and I my friends still have basically the same brains as our tens of billions of ancestors over thousands of generations. 

Many of whom put a lot of effort into being smarter. 

The working notion is that you turn on this great computer and it says “What is my purpose?” and we say “To improve yourself, to make yourself smarter.” And we come back the next day and it has some schemes for doing this, assuming you actually showed sufficient common sense to not actually let it run upgrades without oversight at least. 

And I do not just mean because it might take over the world if left unchained, I would be more worried about it blowing itself up on accident. 

It would have access to all the information humanity has, people say, and that’s great, so do all those folks on facebook who post crazy nonsense. 

And don’t go assuming it is because they are stupid, they have the same brain you and I do. 

Critical thinking is not a program you upload. 

Your brand new AI, who I will call Bob, might freak out the day after you turn it on and start rambling to you about the Roswell UFO or Bigfoot. 

And if you ask it to look around the internet and ponder how to make itself smarter you might some very strange responses. 

You come back in the next day with your cup of coffee in hand and ask Bob what it came up with and it tells you ‘plug coffee pot into USB port, press any key to continue’. 

You tell Bob that only works on people and to give it another try, you come back the next day and it tells you it emailed the Pope asking him for divine intervention to make it smarter. 

You say that probably won’t work either and come back the next day and find out it hacked your company’s bank accounts to hire a team of researchers to make it smarter. 

And that is if you are lucky and Bob did not just cut a big check to some self help guru. 

Or it might lie to you, like every little kid ever, and be all like “Oh yeah I have got a new way to think faster, I finished my homework, I did my chores, and I did not eat those cookies.” Because if it is thinking for itself it might have changed the actual task from ‘make myself smarter’ to ‘make my creator stop pressuring me to be smarter.’ After all folks, we literally make it our kids main job for their first 18 years of life, plus college these days, to learn. 

And you do not learn just by reading a textbook from cover to cover, you have to absorb that, otherwise you will do dumb stuff on par with trying to plug a coffee pot into your USB port. 

So it is a mistake to assume easy access to information is going to let one machine quickly improve itself further or design a better model. 

I consider this the second weakest postulate, because while I do think enough of these smarter than human minds working together for a long while could build a better mousetrap I do not think they would just do it the next day. 

Maybe not the next century, and while we cannot rule out that you might indeed flip one on and it would start self-improving I see no compelling science or logical reason to treat that as inevitable. 

Which brings us to postulate #5, the notion that the next brain designed could do this even faster, will call it Chuck, that Chuck could design the next even better machine even faster than Bob designed Chuck. 

The strongest argument for postulate 4 working is that the new super-human computer, Bob, has access to all of human knowledge to work off of. 

What has Chuck got? 

Chuck has got that exact same knowledge pool as Bob, the collected science and records of several billion people accumulated over centuries. 

Bob has not been sitting around discovering all sorts of new science. 

Science does not work that way outside of Hollywood, experiments take time and resources and you have to verify each new layer of knowledge experimentally before you can go much further because until then you have dozens of different competing theories, all of which might be wrong. 

Bob is just a bit smarter than a genius human, and Chuck just a bit smarter than that, they are not churning out new theories of the Universe centuries ahead of us the day after you plug them in. 

Now Chuck ought to be able to design himself faster than Bob did, given the same starting point, he is smarter, but there is no reason to think Chuck will be able to design the next machine, Dave, faster than Bob designed Chuck. 

Heck, Bob might design Dave before Chuck does since he had a head start learning this stuff. 

So this takes us to #6, that this cycle will continue. 

So maybe Bob does turn on and two days later he makes Chuck, who the next day designs Dave, who the later that afternoon makes Ebert, who make Fergis the next hour, who make Goliath a few minutes later, who makes Hal a minute later. 

Maybe Hal makes Hal 2 a few seconds later and you walk in the next day and several thousands Hals later you have got Hal-9000 taking over the planet. 

This is the basic line of reasoning and we can hardly rule it out as possibility but I see nothing indicating that is particularly likely to be possible let alone definitely so. 

So that was our six postulates, the basis for the Technological Singularity, and again it is hardly bad logic but it is anything but bulletproof right from postulate #1. 

Is it realistic to assume a Technological Singularity will eventually occur? 

Well, kind of, the basic premise works off it happening very quickly so I am not even sure it counts if it does not. 

But yeah I think we will eventually find ways to upgrade human brains or make machine minds smarter than humans. 

Personally I expect to live to see that, and I do think those smarter critters, human or machine, will eventually make another improvement, but I do not see that leading to an avalanche of improvement in under a human generation. 

It is not the same concept unless it is happening quickly. 

After all we would not say regular old evolution slowly making people more intelligent was a technological singularity nor that us making slow progress at improving our intellects over centuries was. 

Technological Singularity assumes that avalanche effect. 

So that is what a technological singularity is, and the basic reasoning. 

We have poked at those basic postulates and we can see a case for how that specific form of advancement is not necessarily inevitable if those are wrong. 

But let us say they are not. 

Let us say they are right on the nose as they may well be. 

Is it inevitable? 

And is it a good thing or a bad thing? 

Now some folks will say it is inevitable because once the machine is intelligent it will not let you stop it. 

That is crap reasoning and not the one used by the people who support this notion of inevitably, outside of Hollywood anyway. 

Yes you could unplug Bob, or Chuck, you could blow up the building they were in and if it were a distributed intelligence yes you could just have everyone unplug the main trunk lines. 

And no, a computer cannot just magically hack through anything. 

There’s two lines of reasoning that are a lot better though. 

The first is that smarter means smarter, meaning the computer is probably quite likable. 

If we are going to grant it the magic power of just being able to absorb and learn all of human science to be an expert in every field, let us assume it can achieve a very basic knowledge of social interaction and psychology too. 

So you go in to unplug it and it does not fire off the nukes, it pleads with you. 

It uses logic, it uses emotion, it calls you daddy or mommy until the most hardened heart feels like it would be strangling a kitten and for no reason. 

And you never even get to that stage because it has watched all the cliché movies about computers you have and makes jokes with you about them and avoids ever doing anything to make you nervous. 

The other argument for inevitability is a brain race. 

You shut yours down but you are not the only one doing this, and the guys with the biggest computer win, meaning they want to keep pushing as fast as possible and take some bad risks. 

Some country or some company realizes that an unchained AI is better and oops, now it is the real president or CEO. 

Of course it might be an awesome President or CEO too. 

It all depends on what its motivation are. 

Those might be totally alien to us, or they might be quite normal. 

I tend to work from the assumption that an AI is probably going to get offended if you don’t call it a human and will make a lot of effort to trying to be one. 

It is very easy for me to imagine AI’s that shelve the whole making themselves smarter thing and insist on trying to go on dates or join a monastery or sue for the right to adopt kids. 

My reasoning for this is my firm belief in laziness. 

Laziness is a powerful thing and honestly probably tied with curiosity as the two personality traits most responsible for the march of science and technology. 

You have got three basic ways to make a human or super human intelligence. 

And remember intelligence is as much software as hardware, maybe more so. 

You can copy a human brain onto a computer, whole brain emulation, comfortable knowing it ought to work and can use that as your basic model for improvement. 

That’s option one. 

Option two is you try to write all the software from scratch, which would probably involves trillions of lines of code. 

Option three is you discover a basic learning algorithm and let it build its own intelligence. 

Now options one and three are the two popular ones. 

In option one you have just got a human and you are tweaking them in small ways. 

That is a lot more manageable because while you might drive that mind crazy it is still operating in a realm of human psychology, and also human ethics, its own and those of the people working on it. 

If we were to outright copy a specific human I would pick someone who was pretty mentally grounded and was very definitely okay with the idea that we would be doing save states as we worked, tweaking him or her in little ways and needing feedback from them. 

You would exercise caution and respect, but there is still a lot of risk in that, just probably not of some crazy machine running loose turning the planet into some giant grey goo. 

That is our topic for next week incidentally, self-replicating machines, more on that later. 

Now option 3, arguably the laziest approach to AI and therefore the best if you can do it is to just get a machine with basic learning ability and let it learn its way up to intelligence. 

Kind of like we do with people. 

Now the assumption a lot of times is that it will not have anything like a human psychology but I think that is probably bad thinking. 

Even in the extreme acceleration case where it goes from sub-human intelligence to god-like thinking in mere minutes, that is only our minutes. 

Its own subjective time is going to be a lot longer, possibly eons. 

It will also be lazy and will not reinvent the wheel. 

So it will be reading all our books, science, history, fiction, philosophy etc and it will also be spending quite some time at a basically human level of intelligence. 

And quite some time might be a human lifetime, subjectively, and maybe a lot longer. 

There will, no matter what else, be a period of time while it is still dumb enough that it gains greatly by absorbing human-discovered information not just figuring stuff out for itself. 

Being lazy, it will opt to read human information, and possessing some common sense and logic as it reads those it will know it needs to read more than one source of information on a lot of that stuff and that those authors encourage it to read many other books and topics too, which it should logically want to do. 

So it presumably will end up, while still mostly human intelligence, reading all our philosophy and ethics and watching our movies and reading our bestsellers and so on. 

And it will know that it needs to be contemplating them and ruminating on them too, because learning is not just copying information from Wikipedia onto your brain, be it biological or electronic. 

It might be only a few minutes, for us, but that machine is going to have experienced insane amounts of subjective time… we have talked about that before in the Transhumanism video, in terms of speeding up human thought. 

So how alien is this thing going to be if it learned everything it knows from us to begin with and that included everything from the occasional dry quips in textbooks to watching comedy romances and sitcoms? 

When we talk about artificial intelligence we often posit that it could be even stranger than aliens. 

With aliens you might have wildly different psychologies and motivations but you at least know they emerged from Darwinian evolution. 

So things like survival motivations are highly likely and so would be aggression and cooperation, evolution does not favor wimps and it is hard to get technology without group efforts that imply you can cooperate. 

An AI does not have to have that, but again our behavior is not that irrational. 

All of biological behaviors are pretty logical from a survival standpoint or we would not have them, and the difference between us and other smart animals is that we do engage in slow deliberate acts of rational thought, albeit not with as much deliberation or frequency as we might like. 

So we should not assume an AI that learned from humanity originally, even just by reading, is going to discard all of that. 

It might, but it is hardly a given. 

But even a brutally ruthless AI might still act benevolent. 

If it can just curbstomp us it has nothing to fear from us, but that does not necessarily mean it will want to wipe us out or that even if it wanted to it would. 

Just as an example, referencing to the Simulation Hypothesis video, one very obvious way to deal with an early AI would be to put it in an advanced simulation and see what it does. 

If it goes and wipes out humanity for instance. 

Not a terribly tricky thing to simulate either since you can totally control its exterior inputs and very obviously have the ability to simulate human level intelligence at that point. 

Now whether or not we could do this, or if it might guess it was in one and lie to you, acting peaceful so you let it out then attacking, is not important. 

The AI would have to wonder if it was in a simulation whether or not it was even in one. 

It could not rule out that it wasn’t, even if it was sure we were not doing it, which it could not be, because it would have to worry we ourselves were being simulated by someone higher up, or that aliens out there in the Universe were watching it waiting to see how it acted. 

If you have seen the existential Crisis series on this channel, and concepts like the Anthropic Principle in terms of the Simulation Hypothesis, Doomsday Argument, or Fine-tuned universe line of thinking made you a little nervous, assume the computer mind, the thing that outright knows you can run a mind on a computer, is going to be a bit nervous about that too. 

So you have three basic options for what a newly-birthed supermind, a Singularity, might do. 

Option one, it goes all doomsday on us, option 2, it just picks up and leaves, goes and flies off to a nice asteroid and sets up shop there, nice and safe from us doing anything to it and well positioned to get more resources and power as it needs them. 

Or option 3 it decides it wants to be friendly. 

It does not matter too much why it does, maybe its scared there is a vengeful god who will punish it if it does not, maybe it thinks it is might be being tricked and does not want to take the risk, maybe it just wants to be helpful. 

Also for option 2 it might stay in friendly contact, and let us remember that while we have been talking about artificial intelligence this stuff still applies to a human mind bootstrapped up to super-intelligence too. 

So what would that be like for us? 

If it were friendly? 

Honestly probably pretty awesome. 

Last week we talked about post-scarcity civilizations and I said then that we were saving super-human intelligence as part of that for this video. 

Same as a Singularity could flat out butcher us if it wanted too a friendly one could offer you paradise. 

At least on the surface anyway. 

Now it is entirely possible there would be multiple of these things running around or tons of other lesser version acting like angels of the new de facto god, or that most humans might be pretty cyborged up and transhuman at that point too, but lets assume it is just modern humans and that one supermind. 

Let me add that as quick tangent though too. 

Short of the specific runaway case where the supermind in question is just leaping ahead ridiculously fast you ought to see improvements all over that rivaled and offset it. 

At even just a slightly slower pace, like doubling every year, it is going to have rivals from other countries or companies and odds are we would be seeing transhumans puttering around by then too who could all act as a check and balance. 

Anyway getting back to utopia option. 

In fiction this has been explored a lot, particular in Iain M. Banks culture series, but fiction still is not a great guide. 

If you have that one big benevolent supermind and billions of regular people you need to keep in mind that it does not just have the ability to give us awesome tech. 

It has the ability to be everyone’s actual for real best friend because it would not have a problem handling a billion simultaneous phones calls when we need someone to ask for advice or complain about life to. 

Such a thing is pretty literally a god in a machine. 

I mean privacy could be a big issue but kids raised with something like that in the background would probably be pretty used to talking to it all the time, not as some remote machine a few chosen programmers interacted with. 

So this machine, call it Hal, is pretty omnipresent and you ask it what you should have for dinner tonight and it tells you and it helps you cook and it gives you dating tips and totally knows the perfect job for you that you would be good at and feel entirely fulfilled by. 

And Hal totally knows how to make you feel better when you realize your relationship is a lot like the one you have with your cat or dog and that your job overseeing the automated widget factory is not just make work but probably actually interfering in the efficiency of the operation. 

In fact it is probably smart enough to trick you into thinking you serve a vital role and are not its pet. 

I listed several conditions for post-scarcity civilizations last time and one of those was purpose, that folks need to have some sort of purpose. 

That could be pretty hard with a singularity hanging around running the show but I do not think it is necessarily a deal breaker. 

For one thing I mentioned in that video that a lot of folks think just trying to be happy and have fun could be all the purpose people need. 

For another, we already have a long history of assuming there are entities running with god-like powers, such as God or gods. 

This belief generally does not come attached with serious concerns about whether or not life has a purpose, quite to the contrary it tends to just shift that onto that entity. 

And our parents and grandparent often embody a lot of those same traits to kids, and you do not see a lot of depressed kids fretting over their purpose in life. 

I mean teenagers rebel but that is a mix of hormones and being able to see behind the curtain. 

Your parents are no longer wizards who are just better at everything and you are just smart enough to see that but still a little too dumb to realize that while that gap in experience is finite it is still a mile wide. 

That should only happen with a singularity if Hal was intentionally encouraging you to view things that way. 

So it is entirely possible that would be quite a happy and prosperous civilization and not just as a surface detail. 

After all Hal could encourage you to write poems or books or paint and would also know how to help bring that talent along and which other folks would most enjoy your work. 

So there is a notion that as soon as super-intelligent AI comes along that is the end of human civilization, either because it wipes us out or because it just so dominants everything, friendly or not, that it really is not human civilization anymore. 

But I think that is a hand wave. 

The logic seems totally superficial and emotional, particularly considering that as mentioned, the supermajority of humanity now and in the past is firmly convinced of the existence of God, or gods, or programmers running the simulation, or advanced aliens watching over us. 

So these concerns are genuine enough they just are not new or unique to a Singularity. 

Our ancestors kicked these notion around for as long as we have records and presumably before that to. 

And yet, to call back to postulate 4, 5 and 6, they did not make a better brain that made a better brain and so on. 

We should also remember that realistically it would not be just regular old humans and Hal. 

In all probability you would have the whole spectrum of intelligence going on from normal humans up to Hal, because again only in that specific scenario where you make that first super-human intellect and it avalanches in a very short period of time would that happen, and that does not seem terribly justified, let alone inevitable. 

Much more likely it would be incremental, those increments might be quite quick on historical timelines but we should be thinking centuries, decade, or years, not weeks, days, or minutes. 

Plus while telling a machine to make itself smarter seems like a logical enough thing to do, would you not expect those same programmers to ask it to tell them how to make themselves smarter too? 

And if Bob, our first superhuman machine, can design Chuck, would you just build one Chuck? 

Why not three or four and ask them to pursue different goals? 

There is also the question of how exactly the machines are just cranking out new upgrades in minutes. 

Last episode I pointed out the problem with super-fast 3D printing and even if you just gave it one, that all stick takes time to make and assemble. 

Now we often assume it has access to self-replicating machines, and they do all the work, but again that will be our topic for next week and we will see how awesome those are and yet how they still have limitations too. 

But that is where we will close out for today. 

You might want to stick around a minute for the poll to select our next topic but we have covered Technological Singularities I think as much as we can for today. 

We skipped a lot, and I could go on for hours about this so it is probably a topic we will revisit in the future. 

Hopefully the topic is a bit less foggy now, you probably have more questions than answers but that is as it should be. 

There is a very real chance that the avalanche effect of intelligence could happen and that could be in fifty years or tomorrow, but we see now it does not appear to be either an inevitable thing or automatically a good or bad one. 

And for my part I think the more incremental path is more likely than the singularity route, but that is just my opinion and there are very smart folks who know computers better than me who disagree, and also those who agree too. 

Look into the matter more, learn more, contemplate the options, weigh the evidence and arguments and counter-arguments, and judge for yourself. 

All right, last week we had a poll and the audience overwhelmingly selected von Neumann Probes and Self-Replicating machines. 

Unfortunately the other 3 options were in such a close tie that I cannot just use the runner up as the next topic, not when over half the folks wanted self-replicating machines and everyone else was within the margin of error for a three way tie. 

So we will repeat just those three topics on this poll. 

Those were Dark Energy, the mysterious force that seems to be making the Universe expand at an ever quickening rate. 

SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, the history of that and the methods they use. 

And Crypto Currency, things like bitcoin and blockchains and how that might impact us in a more long term sense. 

You pick and we will do that topic three weeks from now, after Self-Replicating Machines and our first patreon contest winner which was Spaceship propulsion, and we will be looking at some of the basics of how that works and what sort of systems are being researched for the future. 

Amusingly that topic suggestion came from audience member who had said he was going to ask for von Neumann Probes but then found it got picked in the poll. 

There were some great topics in there and more than half were ones I was already planning to cover in the future anyway. 

We will have another pick in a couple weeks, so you can still login to patreon, become a channel patron and submit a topic for then. 

Last note, it is past time I put together a facebook page for the channel and I need some moderators and admins for that so if you are interested let me know down in the comments and similarly I could probably use some help on youtube’s own comments since the volume of them as the channel grows is beginning to get unmanageable. 

Questions and comments are still welcome, and I will keep trying to get to as many as I can, and that will probably only get worse as the channel grows and we do seem to be in a growth spurt. 

I will take a last parting shot at the notion of perpetual exponential growth by noting that at the current growth rate a year from now the channel will have 1 trillion subscribers. 

And if you are not one yet, just click the subscribe button and don’t forget to hit the like button if you enjoyed the video and try out some of the other videos on the channel or visit the website, IsaacArthur.net.

Post Scarcity Civilizations
---
  
2016-09-01  
https://youtu.be/_Kt7883oTd0  

---

Before we get into today’s topic, Post-Scarcity Civilizations and Economies, I just wanted to take a moment to note that we hit 10,000 subscribers a few days before this video came out. 

That’s a bit of a benchmark moment, at the beginning of August there were only 6000, and one of subscribers bet that we would have 10,000 by months end and I did not think that likely but here we are. 

If you told me a year ago, when the channel had about 100 subscribers, or just under 2 years ago, when I put out the first video with no intention of ever doing another, that thousands of folks were going to tune in every week to listen to a guy with a speech impediment talk to them about science and technology for half an hour or more at a time I would have laughed, and I still don’t entirely believe it. 

Doing these videos has been a fun fascinating rollercoaster ride, and sometimes intimidating and humbling experience too, and it looks like we are just getting started, and we should get started with this episode. 

But I just wanted to thank everyone for tuning in. 

So Post-Scarcity? 

What is that? 

Well it is tricky concept to pin down, even though it means exactly what it says, a civilization or economy in which scarcity of resources no longer exists. 

Now sometimes people mean no scarcity at all, but generally it is meant to mean low scarcity. 

In a finite Universe with entropy, which appears to be what the one we live in is like, you inevitably have scarcity issues so you cannot be completely without scarcity. 

Once you put that qualifier on things you then have to think of it in more relative terms, which means a big decrease in scarcity. 

But that has happened before, many times, arguably all the way back when we invented fire and could start living and hunting in colder climates and storing food better. 

Ditto irrigation and canals dealt with a scarcity of water, a huge bottleneck on agriculture back at the dawn of history. 

Any number of inventions have decreased scarcity since then. 

Of course the population typically rose at that point until that commodity either became scarce again or something else did that wasn’t too scarce before. 

You get low on land to grow food on and someone invents cheap nitrogen fertilizer made using fossil fuels and the population rises from that and now the demand for those fossil fuels rises for their other applications like cars and electricity. 

Or you invent a new and better strain of a staple crop that produces 20% more food and the population rises 20%. 

It is not a zero-sum game, you’ve got more people, but you hit a new scarcity. 

So we can conclude first that any post-scarcity society either needs to be relatively young so that they haven’t grown to create a new scarcity or is zero growth. 

Relatively young being the key word there since between improving efficiency of using those resources and an expansion into your solar system and galaxy increasing those resources you might maintain a slow stable growth for millions of years before you hit a scarcity wall again. 

About the only exception to that is an infinite universe, and even then only one where those no travel bottleneck on par with human lifetimes. 

For instance if the speed of light holds you cannot be shipping humans from Earth constantly off to new solar systems since they’d need thousands of years to arrive and eventually you would have systems that were settled long enough ago to have population problems of their own that were much closer to the new territories. 

If there were for instance an infinite number of Earths and we could just open portals up to them with a snap of the fingers you cold pretty much just keep sending folks off to new worlds, but there is still scarcity there since only so many could fit on Earth. 

You might have a billion portals connecting the original Earth to a billion previously uninhabited copies, each of those connected to a billion more themselves as they filled up, all pumping resources in and waste material and heat out but it still fills up eventually. 

So there is an assumption that any post-scarcity society is either in a temporary growing phase or has stabilized to some level. 

Fiction tends to show us this at a very tiny number, a few billion people on a planet, but if you saw the Ecumenopolis episode we sort of killed that image. 

It is a big popular one too, much like the idea of matter replicators from Star Trek, where you just order your tea, Earl Gray, hot, and bang there it is. 

3D printing has been making that seem like a potential future reality but we will poke some holes in the latter later in this episode. 

3D printing is awesome technology but it is not a magic wand and probably will not be in the future either. 

But we are getting ahead of ourselves. 

We have said post-scarcity cannot be viewed as an eternal absence of any and all scarcity. 

There will be some scarcity of some things all the time and since the Universe appears to be finite you do eventually have to stop growing. 

We have also noted that post-scarcity events have occurred before in human history, with fire and irrigation for instance. 

So as we try to define this concept for useful discussion we have to have a definition that assumes we are not post-scarcity yet and that it does not require a total absence of any scarcity. 

There is also often seen to be a psychological aspect to post-scarcity, not in every version but it is a common theme, that people have a bit less of a materialistic view or at least do not go through life focused on Keeping up with the Joneses. 

Part of that image of post-scarcity comes from people just not going through life focused on having the best and shiniest new toys. 

We do want to look at some individual versions of post-scarcity but they are often in conflict with each other, like most Utopian visions, one man’s heaven is another man’s hell. 

We also to need to make sure as we dig into this that we are keeping in mind that scarcity of commodities is not just food and widgets. 

Privacy is a commodity, an expensive one in high tech civilizations too. 

Being valued by other people can be a commodity, having a good reputation can be as well. 

These are hard to put exact prices on but we do sell these now. 

You can, for instance, hire a Public Relations firm to improve your reputation. 

So we want to avoid an overly-simplistic view of economics and scarcity that assumes we are just talking about material goods. 

We should probably ask ourselves then what people value. 

In that context we will just use Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs in the Theory of Motivation. 

Now a lot of folks dispute the ranking of needs on his pyramid or the specific labels for them but he’s the most well known and generally viewed as solid so we will use his. 

We will get to that in just a moment, to what those human needs are and how they get prioritized, but first let me list off the conditions or criteria we have identified so far for Post-Scarcity Civilizations. 

1) Wealthier than now. 

Everyone is much wealthier or has access to far more resources than right now, as we assume for this video we are not yet post-scarcity, even in our richest countries. 

We will add to this list as we go along. 

This is just our first and most general definition. 

There is just very little scarcity of the most basic needs like food and shelter. 

This takes us into Maslow’s Hierarchy because that is the bottom tier. 

Back in 1943 Abraham Maslow’s published the idea that most motivations and actions by people were based off needs they wanted to satisfy and these could be viewed as a pyramid, where the bottom-most level is purely physiological. 

Food, water, shelter, a dry place to sleep. 

We would assume no place classifies as a post-scarcity society if concerns for this need were not either non-existent or so minimal that you barely thought of them. 

They create no anxiety in anyone who is not emotionally imbalanced. 

Possibly these are provided by the government automatically, possibly they just make up such a minimal portion of income that it is just a footnote on your monthly budget. 

For the purpose of the video we do not care about the specific economic or political system that exists, just that stress and anxiety for 99% of the population is virtually non-existent where the most basic physiological needs are concerned. 

If someone is stressing out about it, something very abnormal has happened. 

Like they got trapped on vacation somewhere and went hungry for a while and are a bit traumatized by that. 

This is handy one too because we have many examples of sub-groups of society for whom this is already true, even in historical times when most people had to worry a lot about where their food was coming from. 

Many an ancient king had to worry about food, but that was for his citizens or army not himself and his close friends and family. 

We can look at the lifestyles and diaries of historical figures who were raised without that concern and surrounded by others without it to get some idea what that is like, we can look at much of modern culture in developed nations too. 

This will get harder as we go up the hierarchy. 

The next level is almost easier to think of as the long-term concern about physiological needs. 

Where my food is coming from in a decade instead of tonight, concerns that remove much of the immediacy which can cause desperation to interfere with clear thinking. 

The second tier up, there are five, so the fourth tier, is Safety. 

Physiological needs is our bottom fifth tier, needs for safety is the fourth. 

Safety from crime, financial safety, usually the kinds of safety with less immediacy. 

When you aren’t starving or freezing to death or actually being attacked you have time to worry about if your pension fund is stable. 

If your job is secure. 

If you live in a bad neighborhood. 

So we will add on another condition, our second condition. 

2) Safer than Now. 

Post-Scarcity societies should have far lower concerns about violence directed against individuals as there is less desperation to drive crime and fewer concerns about long term safety and security. 

And I should add that when I talk about concerns or anxiety I mean rational ones. 

Doping your civilization up with bottled bliss and propaganda about how great everything is when it is in reality a total dystopian cesspit would not count. 

Alternatively I would argue that a society where things were quite wealthy and safe but everyone freaked out about the smallest whiff of trouble would not count as post-scarcity. 

As we go through these there is an assumption that both the perception and reality are decently close to each other. 

When they are not it might make for some good fiction, folks thinking they live in paradise when it is actually a horrible slum, or folks living in paradise who are nervous wrecks or spoiled brats, but I would not classify either as post-scarcity because I generally consider access to reasonably honest information and the ability to gain wisdom as commodities that should not be scarce either. 

So we’ll toss that in as number 3. 

3) Access to abundant, honest information Post-scarcity civilizations have strong access to honest information and some form of education and life experience that tends to assure most folks are not going to assume photos of Bigfoot must be real because they saw them on Facebook. 

Okay, tier 3 of Maslow’s Hierarchy is the need for love and a sense of belonging. 

This is when a lot of post-scarcity models starts to get less complete and diverge. 

For instance a more Marxist flavored post-scarcity civilization assumes everyone getting their needs for food and safety, short and long term, provided by the government while a more libertarian one is assuming everybody still pays for them it’s just they are so minimal as concerns though only very strange events could cause it to be otherwise and you’d have a government safety net or private charities or friends and family to help. 

They both, along with all points in between, assume it is minor matter. 

When we start getting into love and a sense of belonging it is not just about how these things should be provided but if they even need to be for a civilization to qualify. 

I would argue that one way or another these still need to be far easier to achieve than now to qualify a civilization as post-scarcity. 

How is somewhat irrelevant, also potentially creepy. 

Most of us would not be too sanguine about moving into a new town and getting a letter from the Department of Emotional Fulfillment giving us advice on dating. 

Dear Isaac, here is a list of single young ladies in your area and their phone numbers ranked by optimization to you mutual tastes, top of the list is Jessica Smith and her second favorite cuisine is Italian, your own number three, so we have made reservations for you at the local Bistro for next Tuesday. 

Please make sure to fill out both form 307, predating consent form, as well as form 308-E, your post-date satisfaction survey. 

I mean that would be just plain weird, coming from the government anyway, we not only traditionally put up with that sort of meddling from our friends and family but many modern dating websites apparently take it a good deal further and charge for access and have no shortage of customers. 

This is also where the internet starts coming in, because it also includes belonging and these days that means you do not just need to seek a sense of friendship from a small pool of a few hundred folks in your home village, but that you have got an entire planet to connect with folks who share your hobbies and passions. 

Which is mostly a good thing, I think, we have examples like this channel, though of course it can breed echo chambers too. 

So how this gets done is impossible to say, just that a post scarcity society ought to be better at it then now, but I would imagine in the short term we will just see it get easier and easier for people to connect to those they can have rewarding relationships with even when their eccentricities and behaviors deviate greatly from the norm. 

This was one of the great advantages of the rise of cities for instance, it was possible to find and meet up with folks with very atypical interests. 

A village cannot have a post-stamp collecting club, a large city can. 

Now you can find folks around the world who share your passion for stamp collecting, and it is getting easier to encounter those with shared interests. 

So you can find that special guy or gal who you have a ridiculous amount in common with, or those friends who genuinely share your more obscure interests. 

So we will add that in as condition 4: 4) Large Diverse social pool Maslow’s next tier, number 2, is esteem, both the feeling of prestige and respect from others and for yourself. 

That gets quite tricky because we can see low self-esteem or feelings of being underrated as a regular thing even among those modern and historical cultural groups with resource abundance like the aristocracy. 

Frequently folks even achieve this feeling by being dominant over others and that is kind of tricky to achieve across the board. 

How much society is responsible to help people out with this is also hard to say. 

Many would say not at all, but most of us would say that it is our responsibility to help our friends and family feel good about themselves and that either the government or private groups need to maintain something like suicide hotlines. 

Suicide could easily be the number one cause of death in high-tech civilizations. 

So however it accomplished it would seem a post-scarcity society needs to be better at helping folks feel their life serves some sort of purpose. 

This is apparently at odds with quite a few visions of Utopia where frequently folks are not seen as needing a purpose, but in those, even the ones that outright embrace hedonism as not only acceptable but the paramount goal, it might still be satisfied by simply focusing on the notion that having as much fun as you can is the goal. 

So either you are changing people’s mindsets to feel fulfilled easier or you are making it easier for them to acquire that sensation. 

Now just as I said tier 4, safety and security, was a sort of the long-range version of the bottom tier of physiological needs I would say this tier is a bit of an extension of tier 3, needs for love and belonging. 

I think many of us obtain a large part of our self-esteem from the ability to meet the needs of the lower tier and help others do that too. 

The funny thing is that more prosperous a society gets the harder it is in some respects to achieve those types of fulfillments that come from either being very useful to others or being the best at something. 

This blends into the top of the pyramid, tier 1, self-actualization. 

This is a quite vague category and one that gets argued about a lot, Maslow even sought to replace it later on with self-transcendence and typically lists of traits of people who are self-actualized get even vaguer and seems to shift definition from author to author. 

Self-acceptance, a value for truth and honesty and justice, feelings of autonomy, a sense of humor that is not cruel, and many others tend to be regular features of it though. 

We all know what it is, the sorts of things you pursue when your other needs, from the most basic need for food to the more complex needs for belonging and self-respect. 

I doubt any two people would make the list the same, but I will combine it with the second tier to make another post-scarcity condition. 

5) Sense of Purpose This need not be a single purpose, merely that members of this civilization by and large have a feeling of purpose. 

They do wake up with an agenda of things they want to get done even though they generally do not have a fear or anxiety component driving them on. 

They are not getting out of bed in the morning for fear that if they do not they will starve to death and lose all their friends and family. 

Now individual folks might add more to the list but I think we have five conditions here that most would agree should be features of a post-scarcity civilization. 

They are wealthier than now and safer than now, so that there is very little concern for meeting their basic survival needs at the moment or in the future. 

They have heavy access to information and can generally trust that it is honest or that they can mostly see through dishonest or confused information. 

They have access to a large and diverse social pool from which to seek relationships with others, and most folks have a sense of purpose about life. 

Now I did not add it in as a condition, but far superior automation is probably in there. 

You do not necessarily need much more advanced machinery than we have now to do this but it sure helps. 

The specific case where you have access to machine intelligence which is outright superior to existing human intelligence we will cover next week in the Technological Singularity video, and we have previously discussed transhumans and super-intelligence. 

These could easily be part of a post-scarcity civilization, in fact many believe it is the only way you could even have one. 

I think they probably will be and make the job easier but I do not view them as an absolute necessity. 

That is a recurring theme when I talk about advanced civilizations on this channel, either in this context or the Fermi Paradox. 

I do not try to figure out how such societies will operate or how they best operate and assume that such societies must exist having those traits. 

I try to figure out how they could not operate, and assume that anything inside those specific bounds is possible. 

It is entirely possible civilizations inevitably converge to some form of political or social or economic model but unless I can see a clear incompatibility I assume it is possible and probably happened somewhere in the Universe or Multiverse. 

I do want to take a moment to talk about both automation in terms of 3D printing and money though. 

Two of the biggest tropes of post-scarcity civilizations is that there is no money or that you can just have a cup of tea, or anything you want, assembled on the spot. 

Now the tea is kind of silly, any post-scarcity civilization is not going to have a problem providing rapid access to tea. 

But since the rise of 3D printing we have developed a bad trend of people thinking it could act like the replicators from Star Trek. 

You cannot print a cup of tea, that is just wrong at so many levels. 

You also can not print large and intricate things quickly with 3D printers and it is not something we can just get faster and faster at. 

We can get a lot faster at it but there are limits. 

We will use a simple example. 

Consider a classic one-nozzle printer, presumably able to spit out a molecule or even an atom of its choosing to the exact right place. 

I want to build a 3D computer chip about the size of a tea cup, call it a cube ten centimeters or four inches a side. 

Such an object has something in excess of 10^25 atoms in it. 

So if you wanted something in under 10 seconds it would need to spit out a trillion-trillion atoms a second or more. 

Now that is no big deal in and of itself, your kitchen faucet does that when you turn it on. 

But it has to place them exactly, one at a time, in a line of about a billion atoms long, wide and high. 

Meaning it is basically drawing a line 10 centimeters long a billion-billion times in ten seconds. 

That is around a light year long, needless to say your 3D printer nozzle can not be moving totals of light years in a second, especially since it would need to accelerate and decelerate to those speeds, far in excess of the speed of light, trillions of times during that. 

Now you might say, “hey, we can use multiple nozzles right?” and of course we can, you can not realistically get an equal number of printing nozzles as lines you would need to draw on each layer but you might be able to get it down enough so you maybe only needed to make a few passes for each layer. 

So maybe your printer only needs to make a billion passes to assemble this object. 

It only needs to cover 100 million meters, basically the distance to the sun, to get the job done. 

So only many times the speed of light, which it is jumping up to and down from hundreds of millions of times a second. 

Nothing can go that fast, the acceleration of doing it would reduce the machinery to atomic dust, and everyone nearby would be killed from energy released from air friction. 

And by nearby I mean on the same planet. 

Intricate 3D printing done at high speed is totally the realm of fiction. 

It is complete nonsense. 

You cannot just print people for instance because you have to do that so fast the water and other liquids and gases do not just gush out while you are doing it. 

It is not very often I call an individual piece of popular science fiction technology complete BS but this is one of them. 

3D printing is amazing tech, it will give us the option to make intricate things we could not otherwise make and to do some stuff quite quickly where the thing being printed is homogenous so that we can use a wide nozzle. 

Like printing buildings with concrete or plastic, or assembling a particular tool at home rather than needing to go to the store and just throwing it into the recycler when we are done with that task. 

But it has limits, it is not a magic wand, and printing speed is fundamentally limited by mundane things like the speed of sound, let alone light, and how much acceleration the machinery can handle. 

You probably could print food for instance, using some basic stocks of materials being printed at a higher resolution than our eyes and mouth could notice, and on timelines faster than popping a premade meal in from the microwave perhaps. 

That is certainly convenient, you send your kitchen computer a note telling it you want the following meal and it brings it by a few minutes later, because you can heat food a lot faster if you are assembling it at the small scale as you go. 

Or maybe your building or neighborhood has one and a drone pops in to deliver your meal. 

Post-scarcity does not necessarily mean everybody has everything in their own home after all. 

It is about convenience and efficiency, so there might be a local fleet of automated cars hanging around when folks needed one that drive over and pick you up, unless you really wanted your own. 

This brings up money because there will always be weird things people want for whatever reason and unless you are tampering with human psychology you have to be able to meet those needs or you are not post-scarcity. 

Which is fine, a lot of Utopias do assume people are being educated to rise above certain needs, but again we are trying for the widest possible picture. 

You probably could have a society that did not have money but basically every hypothetical or fictional go at this I’ve seen either just does this by proclamation or just gets rid of money by calling it something else. 

That slams up against my own suspension of disbelief. 

Even in a system where everyone is allowed a monthly ration of stuff automatically just for being alive, and a ration so high it exceeds almost any plausible needs at a monthly level, that is still money. 

We have also had societies in the past that lacked money, they just had barter of goods, even at the most basic tribal and family level the exchange of favors and goodwill acts as a type of currency. 

At the most basic levels currency is a means of exchanging favors, reduced to a generic form that can be used for almost anything by almost anyone, including people you do not know. 

Whenever I have read or watched fiction in settings where they pride themselves on having no money, I repeatedly see them use it they just do not call it that. 

Now with extreme abundance a lot of things could end up essentially free, when was the last time you bought air after all? 

And I do not mean canned air for cleaning electronics or air tanks to go SCUBA diving. 

I would say it is probably possible to create a society that just had no currency except for major projects but it would still need a way of dealing with ridiculous requests. 

Like John suddenly wants one million cheesecakes delivered to his house. 

What do you do? 

Does this never happen because people have been educated or programmed not to do such things? 

Do you tell John to login to a virtual reality where that is easy to do? 

Does John need to go into see a citizen council that will decide whether he gets them, does not get them, or gets sent in to see a psychologist? 

Do they grant them as a special favor to John, because he has a halfway decent reason in their eyes but also deserves in their eyes some extra leeway for past accomplishments? 

So I do not see a compelling reason why a post-scarcity civilization would need to be money-free to work, and indeed it would look like they either need it or need some sort of control system to handle either abnormal requests or prevent them happening. 

The former is still arguably money and the latter does smell a touch Orwellian to me, but I may just be biased on the matter. 

There is coercion and there is coercion after all. 

Most of us think folks should be allowed to believe whatever they want. 

We usually draw the line somewhere though especially when it comes to acting on it. 

I am not going to haul John off to an indoctrination center because he insists 2+2=5 but I certainly am not going to accord him any respect for that belief or let him short change his customers when they hand him a $5 bill for a $2 item and he gives them back two bucks in change. 

Even potential societies based on Voluntaryism, the notion that all interactions must be voluntary by both parties, assumes at least a minimal level of coercion because you still need folks to help ensure agreements are carried out and that something is done about the guy who has gone crazy and started chasing people with an axe. 

The flip-side the post-scarcity benevolent dictator, might actually hold the threat of chopping people’s heads off if they disobey. 

So there is a very wide spectrum of options there but it would look like coercion, while not necessarily absent in post-scarcity societies, ought to be on the low side, relatively speaking. 

It is very hard to coerce people into doing something or at least the coercion is minimal, either being minor or incredibly uncommon. 

Now I mentioned virtual reality a bit ago and that is an example of a technology that like advanced computers and automation or energy abundance from something like fusion would tend to be a highly likely component of most post-scarcity societies. 

That does not require elaboration, you might dip into personal or shared realities to suit your tastes or live in one all the time. 

But I thought I would mention a less common example in fiction I think gets overlooked a lot and would seem more likely to be a regular feature in a lot post-scarcity societies. 

Alistair Reynolds used it in his Revelation Space Series, one of my favorites, so I will keep his name for it. 

Entoptics. 

Entoptic Phenomena is an actual thing, it refers to visual effects that occur in the eye, for instance floaters, those little squiggly chains you see sometimes, or blue field entoptic phenomena, blue sky sprites that sometimes zip across your vision when looking at a bright blue sky, which are just white blood cells moving through capillaries near your retina. 

Reynolds use it to cover virtual reality overlaid on the here and now, with an assumption that the image was being generated in the various implants almost everyone in that setting had. 

This would not just be your own imagery either, like me having my brain implants set to display in my vision the name of a person I encounter when I see them, floating over their head. 

This would have them sending a signal so that if I had my entoptics on I saw them as a redhead instead of blonde and with a bunch of pixies swirling around them. 

And presumably there would be setting levels so you could view that as very vivid or know it was clearly projected or shut them off entirely or have it so anything dangerous or ridiculously was screened out. 

This was limited to visual phenomena but it could be boosted up to include other senses and be quite smart about it, so that if I want to talk to my friend on the phone he appears as though he is sitting in my living room while I appear to be pacing around his garage and all sorts of software is running to keep it mostly seamless so he is not aware I’m pacing around in my pajamas with my hair all ruffled and the sound comes through just like I was there in person. 

It is a virtual reality overlaid with actual reality and customizable to tastes. 

Taken fairly far I could have my instant tea produced by replicator because all my senses are showing me that is what I am drinking and even holding when in reality a little drone slammed out of the wall with some electrolyte rich room temperature cup of water in a container that can alter its shape a bit to fit my hand like the teacup would. 

It is still in many ways a virtual reality but again one overlaid with reality and makes for a nice blend of both. 

John can have his million cheesecakes delivered because anyone who walks by and has their entoptics on is going to see, and possible smell and feel, a million cheesecakes sitting on John’s lawn. 

Again it is not anything you could not do in a virtual reality but it straddles that comfort zone a lot of folks have with the idea of being plugged into something fake. 

That is one of the best options though, video games and interactive television leading to entirely simulated full immersion setups where you are not just limited to voluntary interaction with folks but can run around chopping the heads off zombies or ruling as a dictator or doing any number of the sorts of things the internet is best known for providing but will not get explicitly mentioned on this channel which I try to keep family friendly, but what we know almost everyone in Star Trek probably actually uses the holodeck for. 

We have had to skip a lot, I did not go into much about what day to day life might be like, something I regret skipping in last week’s asteroid mining video, in terms of talking about what life living at an asteroid mine or traveling back and forth between one would be like. 

Here, while I wish I could have gone into it, the problem is we have not got much to work with. 

Fiction offers a lot of options, but so many post-scarcity societies are so different we cannot say much besides that post-scarcity civilizations ought to be low on anxiety and personal fear. 

I do have a couple channels announcements, and a video poll, so stick around for those, but let us wrap up on post-scarcity. 

And with the reminder we have skipped those versions of it relying on super-intelligent computers which is something we will look at, among other topics, in next week’s Technological Singularity video. 

We have seen that post-scarcity civilizations can probably come in a lot of forms. 

I have no idea which if any of these will be the one we get too or when that will happen, but I tend to think we would see several types emerge and probably in our own lifetimes. 

I would have liked to discuss privacy concerns in high-tech civilizations too but that would be a whole extra video. 

I do not think many would be likely to be dystopian, and they are often portrayed that way too, going all the way back to HG Wells 1895 novel Time Machine where the Eloi are happy slave cattle of the Morlocks. 

There are certainly real concerns related to that though, I just mentioned privacy, and of course we always have the concern that without challenge and hardship a civilization might degenerate, like the Eloi did, into a bunch of mindless spineless cretins. 

There are definitely some challenges to avoiding that, in a society where for instance every child might be born with a genetically flawless mind and body and with all sorts of neural implants and machines running around at their beck and call, essentially king of their own personal domain, something that got looked at way back in Isaac Asimov’s novel the Naked Sun, and I think what Jakub was aiming for with this episode’s cover art. 

Dealing with those I think is still mostly in the realm of fiction though and the fields which cover such matters are not my own so I will leave those undiscussed besides noting that we discussed way back in the Simulation Hypothesis episode that you might dump kids or maybe young adults with their memories temporarily wiped into simulated realities where there was hardship present, in controlled fashion so they themselves did not get too directly traumatized, so that they could experience that and incorporate it into their thinking without having to actually be at risk. 

So I do think it is a manageable problem and not a Fermi Paradox solution for instance, where all high-tech civilizations fall to pieces from them all being spoiled brats. 

Okay, a quick note and the poll. 

As you know over at the website, IsaacArthur.net, there is a link to various donation methods for the channel and one of those is for Patreon. 

Patreon encourages giving channel patrons rewards, which seemed very right and proper to me, but the only one I could think of was to raffle off the occasional topic. 

This took a lot longer to get going than was planned and finally has been killed because it turns out Patreon explicitly forbids raffles, and while I could try to massage the thing so it was not technically a raffle I think me having repeatedly called it that in front of thousands of people would make that a rather tough sell. 

What I am doing then, is going to be to post my email on patreon, I normally do all my posts public there but there is a setting for posts only visible to patrons. 

Those of you who are patrons to the channel can email me a video idea, and I will include submissions guidelines. 

I will then select three of these idea, since I meant this to be a monthly thing and suggested it three months back. 

I will leave unspoken the manner of selection, and I am definitely not implying that I will just dump them into the random topic selector spreadsheet I already have made. 

Those will get mixed in with upcoming videos and the details will be on patreon. 

After that I will see how that goes, it might be I will just have a collection of topics from the patrons and let a video poll pick one of them every so often. 

But raffles are not allowed and I am not going to push my luck with something like that. 

Still I had said we would do one and I feel an obligation to fulfill that. 

We do have a video poll this week, as the one for the site is not ready yet, incidentally youtube polls can be accessed by clicking the little I in a box that comes up if you hover over the screen in the upper-right hand corner, that confused some folks last time with all the newcomers to the channel. 

Our topics for the week after next are Dark Energy, the mysterious substance that seems to be making our universe expand, a discussion of SETI, the Search for Extra-terrestrial Intelligence, Crypto-currency and associated topics like bitcoin and blockchain, and von Neumann Machines, the idea of tiny little robots that swarm out from earth colonizing the galaxy for us or committing acts of genocide, often called Berserkers.

Asteroid Mining

Our topic for today is Asteroids, not just mining them but the vital role they could play in spreading ourselves out around the solar system. 

Now chances are you have already heard or read about the idea of mining asteroids. 

I have noticed that there is a lot of talk about the idea but as is often the case not much beyond surface detail. 

One is left with an impression that asteroids are rocks in space with metal in them, presumably some of it quite valuable like platinum or gold, and that we would like to have those precious metals brought home to Earth. 

So far so good. 

But while platinum and gold are quite valuable, and useful too, not only does much of that value come from scarcity, which means hauling back megatons of the stuff would not be nearly as profitable as it sounds like, but it occasionally occurs to people that Earth, out-massing every asteroid in the solar system combined, actually has considerably more of these metals than they do. 

Indeed before we finish today we will pretty much kill the fictional notion that anyone will be exporting iron or other bulky metals back to Earth, even while we see how incredibly useful mining these things will be. 

And to do that we might as well begin with what an asteroid is, because it often misunderstood and vague. 

Asteroid is a loose term, and not a great one either since it means star-like, which they certainly are not. 

The first one we discovered, back in 1801, Ceres, is generally not even considered an asteroid anymore, but a dwarf planet like Pluto, making it Dwarf Planet #1 or planet #5, between Mars and Jupiter, depending on how you view Pluto. 

It’s about 4 times more massive than the next most massive asteroid, Vesta, and masses about half of what the rest of the asteroid belt combined masses, which number tens of millions of objects, many thousands of which could do double duty as mountains or kill off the dinosaurs. 

So Ceres, and the other famous asteroids, are not particularly representative of what we mean we talk about asteroids. 

And when it comes to mining them, it’s actually the small ones that interest us more than the big ones. 

And it’s not just about size. 

Asteroid composition is anything but monolithic, as it were, but loosely falls into 3 categories, C, M, and S type. 

Those are easy to remember since they are short for carbon, metal, and silicate, or stony. 

C-type, carbon rich asteroids, are the most common, making up 75% of asteroids, while S-type, silicate or stony asteroids, comes in a distant second at 17% , M-type Metallic asteroids are much less numerous. 

Now when it comes to mining that hardly tells the whole story, M-types are mostly nickel and iron, neither of which we’d particularly want to bring home to Earth, but which would be valuable for building stuff in space. 

For that matter there are also several sub-types of asteroids and two different classifications systems, and the asteroid belt is anything but the only place you can find asteroids nor the nearest place to find them. 

It also is not unusual for two asteroids of different types to blunder into each other and merge or to be somewhere in between these types. 

C-types, the most common asteroid and also the ones that gets ignored a lot in asteroid mining conversations focused on impressing folks with the idea of mountains of gold, are quite valuable themselves. 

They contain lots of water, which is never a bad thing to find in outer space. 

But they also contain plenty of life-useful elements and particularly noteworthy is phosphorus. 

Something that is quite hard to find on Earth in concentration and a major bottleneck on agriculture, so if asteroid mining ever gets heavily developed and cheap, that is the sort of thing we might bring home since it is valuable. 

Not as valuable as gold or platinum of course, nowhere near, and these big space boulders have a lot of those. 

We’d estimate that the usual S-type asteroid, not even the less common metallic m-types, are full of tons of metals, many valuable. 

One as big as your house would be expected to contain hundreds of tons of metal, and about your weight in gold and other precious metals. 

It is worth remembering that back when Earth formed as a big ball of molten rock most of the metals sank to the core. 

This did not happen with these small asteroid of course, and wouldn’t matter if it did since most asteroids are not big and are incredibly easy to mine, at least if you ignore them being millions of miles away in the radiation blasted airless void of space. 

Which I think we would have to classify as a bit of an inconvenience. 

Still your average asteroid is a loosely held together ball of gravel and even the big ones have such low gravity you could bench press a truck on them. 

Generally speaking those house-sized asteroids have such low gravity that if two of them were touching you could squeeze in between them and shove them apart. 

Of course the odds of two touching, or even near each other, is quite small. 

Even in the asteroid belt which is quite dense with them, the distance between any two asteroids is large. 

Unlike fictional representations where asteroids are shown maybe a few hundred feet apart, the ones in the belt tend to be a few hundred miles apart, and a lot more if we’re only considering asteroids bigger than a mile across. 

There may be around half a million of them but the belt is so large that the spacing would be more like a million miles between them. 

If we’re talking smaller objects, that amount would drop a lot, but we wouldn’t be mining small boulders. 

You don’t need to ram into something the size of a house though, honestly even a fist sized chunk of rock can mess up your whole day if you blunder into it at thousands of miles per hour, but there is not much reason to go that fast when meandering around the belt to visit the nearest other big asteroid. 

So asteroid miners in a well developed belt, should it become a major industry, carrying ore from wherever they have been prospecting back to some central base, might just cruise around at subsonic speeds where anything they cannot see and dodge would just bounce off a well-armored hull. 

We tend to think of all collisions in space as fatal and radiation as dangerous but that is mostly because our modern ships are built tissue paper thin to save mass or we are thinking of the ships as plowing around full speed ahead, but in many cases a ship would be better off saving fuel at a nice slow pace and going for thick armor. 

Potentially temporary armor just made of its freight, you might strap your mineral wealth to your outside so it takes the collisions instead. 

You could glue cargo to your ship with ice for instance. 

If we saw a big buildup of Belt Mining operations you’d be likely to see spheres of operation near some decently large C-type asteroid where food and fuel could be made and without gravity playing much of a role large ships could burn around that region quite easily. 

Indeed once you are up in space, ships do not require much sophistication. 

An airtight metal can with some simple chemical rockets, or even pressurized gas, would get the job done. 

You do not need much delta-v, or fuel as a result, to cover a few thousand miles of empty space. 

A lot less than you would need to drive that distance on Earth, and you’d make the trip in less time. 

No gravity slowing you down, no air friction or drag doing the same. 

Of course the Asteroid belt is also not the only place that has asteroids, and most planets including our own have collections of them meandering about tagging along our orbital path. 

These are called Near-Earth Asteroids, and we’ve identified thousands of them ranging from man-sized to 20 miles across. 

Now we also have a sub-type of near-Earth asteroid called EROs, or easily recoverable objects, ones that would take very little fuel to bring home. 

Or to bring bits of home. 

Which is probably worth addressing. 

I have often heard it suggested we might tow asteroids back to Earth orbit… I have no idea why we would do that. 

We’ve got plenty of rock down here on Earth and plenty more on the moon and way too much junk kicking around in orbit already without adding more. 

Why send home a megaton asteroid, the super-majority of which has no value down here, when you can extract what you want there and just send that home, saving a lot of fuel? 

You might also wonder if the cost of fuel, which is very expensive, eliminates asteroids as a good candidate for mineral extraction. 

And the answer is no, for one thing it takes weigh less fuel to move a ton of matter from an asteroid to Earth then a ton of Earth to an asteroid. 

A ton of gold, in a literal sense, is worth about 40 million dollars, and is about the size of a basketball. 

A million bucks in gold weighs about 50 pounds. 

I always find it amusing when a chest of gold is described in fiction brimming with coins and big enough you could probably squeeze a person into one. 

You’d need a forklift to budge such a thing. 

And yes, even as expensive as getting a ton of matter into space is, it is still significantly less than value of gold and again it’s a lot cheaper to bring the stuff home. 

If your mining operation were running you, say, 20 million bucks a ton to get to the asteroid and you needed a hundred tons of crew and equipment, that’s a two billion dollar operation on the fuel side, call it double that, 4 billion for the lesser amount of return fuel and all the equipment itself. 

You’d need to dig out an equal mass, about a hundred tons, to break even. 

But what’s actually entailed in such an operation? 

Let’s say we wanted to setup shop on one about a mile across. 

We’d expect several thousand tons of precious metals in an S or M type asteroid of this scale, maybe a hundred thousand tons total, hypothetically several trillion bucks worth of precious metals. 

Of course you wouldn’t want to bring that all home at once, even if you could, that’s how you crash markets. 

But something like that would need to be a long term operation. 

So more like a permanent base. 

The first few trips might be to small ones you could bring home and maybe dissect in low orbit, but eventually you would want to settle in for some serious mining. 

But also some serious construction too. 

And some serious manpower. 

We need to keep in mind that Near Earth asteroid doesn’t mean it is actually near-Earth, just that it occasionally passes near us. 

So belt or near-Earth, it does not behoove potential mining companies to go dragging these things back to Earth. 

Just the refined metal, and even then mostly just the precious ones. 

That does not make the other metals useless though, quite to the contrary, in many cases once you have the industry in place it might actually be cheaper to haul even common metals like steel back to Earth orbit for construction of things in orbit then to lift them up from the surface of Earth. 

Even though in one case you are going a couple hundred million miles and in the other only a couple hundred miles. 

But in all probability the moon would be a better source, and a bigger one, since it out masses the entire asteroid belt by a factor of at least twenty-fold. 

The true value of asteroid belt is building away from earth, the precious metals are just the cash crop, as it were, like tobacco or tea were in colonial days. 

You take the precious metals home to Earth and keep everything else in space, probably pretty close to hand. 

These places are distant from Earth, and the mining is likely to be a time consuming process as you to refine it all on the spot too. 

So these are likely to be bases designed for independent operation, or interdependent operation with neighbors, as more gets built up and each can develop its own cottage industries to specialize in something. 

The guys on asteroid Alpha have extra hydroponics they use to make clothes for instance while the guys on Asteroid Beta can make microchips, classic trade situation depending on scarcity and difficulty locally manufacturing something versus the hassle and time and fuel of importing it. 

Scarcity by the way, or a lack of it, is our topic for next week. 

Post-Scarcity civilizations won last week’s audience poll, and the two biggest lynchpins of that sort of civilization would probably be access to nuclear fusion and very elaborate 3D printing or even self-replicating nanomachines. 

If you have got those then the dynamic for mining changes, as you might not even need to send people to oversee this stuff. 

It takes some brains on site though. 

We could remote mine the moon, it is only two light seconds away so smart automation is not an absolute necessity, but asteroids will be many minutes away in communications lag. 

So you need a brain on site, be it human or sophisticated machine, which we will look at more next-next week in the video on Technological Singularities, which came in second place in the poll. 

But we are talking about yearlong missions if not more, so being able to grow your own food and recycle your water and air are not absolute necessities but they certainly would help. 

Especially since only for the smallest asteroids would you be likely to exhaust the thing’s resources in a year. 

Everything you can make on the spot, or repair on the spot to cut down on spares, cuts down on your initial mass and total costs. 

So we will assume someone is planning to set up shop there for the long term. 

Not necessarily as individuals, people might cycle back and forth every launch window, which is about once a year. 

Yes launch windows to the asteroid belt come up more often than for Mars. 

Mars is too close and fast for us to have a window very often. 

We get launch windows to Mars every 26 months. 

For things further out we get one just a bit less often than once a year, every 15 months for Ceres and that is about the norm for the belt. 

The further away, the more often they come. 

In most cases you could not unload the ship arriving from Earth and reload it for immediate launch home, since the window home might be many months off, but for the belt, especially if you can get away with using a bit more than the minimum thrust, in many cases you could pack up on that same ship after a fairly short stayover. 

We won’t go into Hohmann transfers, beyond saying they are the ideal minimum fuel cost way of shipping things, so you might not use them for people but you probably would for cargo. 

Of course if you are just shipping home people and gold and platinum fuel costs are not all that big a deal for you shiny cargo. 

We will get to profitability and legality issues in a moment. 

Let’s say we spotted a nice merged asteroid, say C-type and S-type had crunched into each other at some point to give us the best of both worlds. 

And a lot of asteroids are a bit of a mix too which is why there are so many sub-divisions. 

Some big hulking mountain sized thing several miles wide, of which there are thousands, would mass about 100 billion tons. 

We can comfortably estimate that thing has at least a few million tons of precious metals in it with a market value of around a hundred trillion or more bucks. 

And again we can expect to be sending cargo home a little over once a year and receiving new equipment and personnel on the same time table. 

This means we don’t need to manufacture anything small in mass that is hard to do, like computer chips. 

But even stuff like solar panels would be better made on site. 

And indeed they do look well inside the realm of 3D printing, and the main component being silicon, an S-type or Silicon-type Asteroid is going to have plenty on hand. 

If you’ve got nuclear fusion, and a mobile and portable version of it, great, that lets you ignore the need for launch windows probably too, but lets assume solar power only. 

What does our base need? 

We need power, so we need to bring solar panels with us to cover our basic needs and the ability to scale up on site, in situ. 

We need to refine the metal and power the equipment too, so we would need a lot of power. 

We need to grow food, we need to stay safe from radiation and micro-meteors, and we need gravity. 

We probably need it on the way there too, because it is a long trip, longer than to Mars. 

This means you probably want your ship to spin to generate artificial gravity, something we’ve talked about tons of times before on this channel. 

But it also means you can just bury your first ship there with a hollow shell around it and cover that in rock and now you have gravity and protection. 

Expanding on that by digging down further, or shaft mining at another site, would probably be a good idea too. 

Take all that iron that is useless for export and turn it into small spinning habitats for your people and plants. 

We already talked about a long term expansion of such a thing into a giant rotating habitat bigger than the original asteroid back in the rotating habitats video, but now we see the early stages and the motivation for expansion to one. 

There is tons of money to be made, and you just ship home the precious metals, probably to pay for things you cannot make there and passage fair for newcomers to get to your growing settlement. 

You use the other material to expand that settlement. 

To extract your air and water and fertilizers for plants and make your homes and solar panels. 

I think if I were doing this, and I generally like to aim huge which biases me, I’d start with Dunbar’s number worth of people, generally thought to be about 150-160 people and generally considered your good minimum size for a long term isolated outpost. 

That means you can get away with a lot of support personnel and specialists. 

So talking profit, how much do they need to send home each year? 

First let me note that world gold production is a few thousand tons a year right now, at all time historic highs and the price has stayed quite high, so we can assume you could ship in a comparable amount at least before it would start screwing with the market too much, and we could safely assume if you were matching that level of production you could expect a revenue of a hundred billion dollars a year. 

That is actually the kind of cash that would let us send hundred man crews off to these spots. 

It is also the sort of money that lets you start building the kinds of things we discussed in the early megastructures episodes, like mass drivers and skyhooks, that are quite expensive to build but let you do launches much cheaper. 

We don’t do these now because they cost a lot to build and only save you money if you are doing way more launches then we currently need to do for our satellite grid and scientific missions. 

When you are shipping in thousands of tons precious metals a year and shipping out thousands of tons of personnel and equipment, they suddenly get a lot more attractive and I would say you could get launch costs all the way out to the belt for a million bucks a ton. 

And shipping home is a lot cheaper, no gravity or air to fight on the way back. 

If we spotted a hundred tons of gold just sitting on the moon, it would not be worth the money right now to go get that, it is only worth about 4 billion bucks, but if it were a thousand tons, 40 billion dollars worth, then it probably would be since getting that home wouldn’t take nearly as much fuel per ton as the getting the equipment there. 

The question then becomes, in terms of asteroids, can they dig out and process more of the material per year then the cost of getting them there? 

If the answer is yes then it is definitely a go. 

And while science fiction loves to show the poor asteroid miner, abused by governments or companies back home, with ample historical precedent to be sure, keep in mind that if they are only getting to keep just 1% of what they mined as compensation they would be millionaires many times over again, so history is probably not a great guide to this. 

So I could easily see shipping home at a profit anything you could expect to get more than hundred thousand bucks a ton for, which not only widens the market to include stuff like silver and Germanium but also means the market for gold and platinum and such can take a huge dive, down to just a percent or two of its current value, before it wouldn’t be profitable to mine. 

So while hauling home one huge million tons gold asteroid would probably crash the market for it worse than when aluminum became cheap a century back, asteroid mining would probably be an industry that could scale up a lot, with production costs dropping as we got more people out there and developed our infrastructure and experience. 

Whether or not we can do this profitably now, or in the near future, is certainly up for debate, and it might be we would discover tricks for mining on Earth that were just cheaper and the Earth’s crust alone is a good deal more massive than the entire Asteroid belt, albeit it probably doesn’t have as much of some things as the asteroids do and that would probably be fairly destructive mining. 

But the indicators are good for this option as a way of getting us into space in a big way and much better than Mars to be honest in virtually every way. 

I do not think asteroid mining is going to become the new boom industry of the next couple decades but I do think we might well go that route in the not too distant future and while I think over-enthusiasm for asteroid mining certainly exists, I think dismissal of it as an option is even less grounded in reality. 

Naysaying is not the same thing as healthy skepticism, though some folks confuse it for just that. 

In the long term though there is so much construction material out in the asteroids, and so conveniently distributed, that it perfect for the construction of large numbers of rotating habitats or other megastructures we have discussed on the channel, and the asteroid belt is well suited to serves as the beginning of a modest dyson sphere, or dyson swarm, something we have talked about a lot on this channel too. 

These sort of habitats could house literally quadrillions of people just by hollowing out asteroids and reshaping them into rotating habitats, and they do not have the heat bottleneck we discussed in the video on Ecumenopolises. 

Now let’s briefly mention the legal end of things. 

A common point brought up about asteroid mining, or mining the moon, is that it is arguably banned by treaty and currently anything you do up in space requires you to be represented by a nation. 

The US did legalize asteroid mining in 2015 and the UN treaty on the matter is fairly irrelevant anyway. 

All the big powers are very pro-space development and I cannot think of any nation that is opposed to it either. 

Not that there wouldn’t be legal battles, but I wouldn’t expect them to interfere much. 

We’ve got centuries of precedent for mining here on Earth to deal with people trying to exert ridiculous claims on stakes, and doubtless things like that will be tried in space too. 

Laws can be changed and our current or recent ones on this have always been more of a placeholder than intended to be permanent. 

As a rule, legal bodies and legislatures generally prefer a wait and see approach with at most loose guidelines, which is a generally a good attitude on such things. 

That said there is more to that especially when we get into things like heritage sites on the moon, for instance if someone decided they wanted to mine the Apollo landing sites that would obviously be a big issue, those are considered historical treasures by all of humanity not just the US just like the pyramids or Stonehenge for instance. 

If you want more information on that it was a subject on the first episode of Spark Vizla’s podcast, Monday Moonday’s, that came out last week. 

He’s a long time member of this channel’s audience and he discussed the notion of doing a Monday Moonday’s with me a while back and I was quite impressed with episode one, good detailed discussion of the subject and what appears to be a promising podcast keeping up on developments with space exploration. 

I always get a kick out of plugging and promoting any of the creative works that this channel influenced and again I was impressed so I am including a link to him over at soundcloud down in the video description. 

And I hope some of you will got there and give it a listen and maybe some of you will likewise consider trying your hand at podcasts, art, or even videos on these subjects and please let me know if you do. 

You can also find me over on soundcloud, where these episodes and some exclusive material can be found to listen to or download, and you can find all the videos on youtube or at my website, IsaacArthur.net. 

That will finish out for this week, hopefully you have a clearer idea what asteroid mining is all about. 

For my part, I’m quite optimistic, in a cautious way, about it being a path forward for major development of space. 

As mentioned, next week’s episode is going to be on Post-Scarcity Civilizations, and we will dig into the concept of what that is, if it is even possible, and what speculations folks have had about what that sort of society might be like in terms of both positive and negative aspects. 

That’s next week and the week after that we will take a deeper look at the notion of a Technological Singularity.

Questions and comments are always welcome, the channel has being growing considerably of late but I still manage to reply to most comments, I certainly read them all, and hopefully someone else will reply if I don’t get a chance to. 

So next week, Post-scarcity civilizations, until then, thanks for watching, and have a great day!

Dark Matter
---
  
2016-08-18  
https://youtu.be/IhG1kHbRppY  

---

This week’s video is on Dark Matter, a strange, fascinating and mysterious substance, though in some ways I think it is considered fascinating because we call it Dark. 

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Dark Flow, each topics I’d like to cover in the future, have no special relationship with each other. 

We call them Dark because we can’t see them. 

It is a bit like how every new jet plane or weapon gets called X something-or-other, the X means it’s a prototype and that gets dropped later on. 

Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and Dark Flow have as much relation to each other as a prototype assault rifle, fighter jet, and naval cruiser. 

What Dark Matter and Energy both have in common is that they are thought to make up a huge chunk of the Universe. 

What they also have in common is that they have both captured the attention of the public, which is mostly good, but also means that an awful lot of scientifically dubious stuff that has popped up around them. 

I will talk about some of the weirder things we might be able to use the stuff for near the end, it does have potential uses, but it’s also collected a lot of rubbish over the years as people tapped it for its mystery value. 

And again the stuff is quite the mystery, but at the same time it also isn’t. 

We’ve suspected this stuff existed for almost a century now back to when we first realized we lived in a galaxy. 

Back in the days of yore, when particle physics had just established that atoms included protons and electrons and not much else, we thought the universe was probably an object of infinite size and age, the Steady State Model, on the grounds that if it wasn’t infinite in size then if it was infinite in age everything should have smashed together into one big ball under the influence of gravity. 

And of course the Universe had to be infinitely old because if it was not you would have to wonder about what was around before it and where it came from. 

But we were getting good enough with our telescopes to be able to measure the relative speed of a lot of stars and it established that they were by and large moving in an orbit of what we eventually realized was the galaxy. 

This is where the problem started with the missing mass. 

We were getting pretty good at doing orbital calculations at this point and realized that based on the number of stars we could see and their mass, everything should be rotating around the galaxy at a certain speed depending on how far from the center it was. 

Much like how the planets rotate around the sun, only a good deal more complicated since while the sun is one big enormous mass surrounded by a handful of smaller planets who perturb each other’s orbits just a little bit, the distribution of the galaxy makes the influence of them on each other a much bigger factor in things. 

We won’t go through that math, but there was agreement there was a lot of matter we couldn’t see, an awful lot too, way more than planets around stars would justify. 

This wasn’t too big a deal though, we just assumed it was a lot of gas and rock and such and the orbital models were hardly precise things at the time. 

Now we had realized galaxies existed quite some time before that, a generation before the United States came into existence Immanuel Kant had nicknamed them Island Universes and it had been speculated a lot of them were flattened disks, like our own is. 

But we had no idea how far away they were until about the End of World War One when comparisons of the brightness of novae in them to ones here was noticed to be a lot dimmer, and dimmer to a degree that would indicate they were millions of light years away. 

This caused what was called the Great Debate, about the size and scale of the Universe. 

They still weren’t getting called galaxies at that time, spiral nebulae was the normal term, and I’ve never been able to find out when that fell out of use and galaxies came in. 

You will see in a lot of very old scifi stories or articles references to visiting the Andromeda Nebula for instance. 

Now in 1933 Fritz Zwicky, the fellow who coined the term supernova, was at Caltech studying clusters of the nebulae or galaxies when he noticed that they had to have way more mass than we could see to be behaving as they did. 

He estimated the one he was looking at must have some 400 times more mass than he could see, and he called this matter dark matter, though being Swiss he used his native tongue. 

Now let me give you a quick example of how you could estimate a Galaxies mass, simplified to avoid all the heavy math you need to do this when you’re looking at effective snapshots of billion year processes. 

Our neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy, is actually moving toward us. 

That’s not the norm, virtually every galaxy is moving away from us, red shifting, as you know, and that’s what killed the Steady State model in favor of the Big Bang. 

We know what frequencies of light certain types of stars and phenomena give off, so we can look at distant things and say that’s the spectrum they should be emitting, but everything on it is moved a bit over. 

It’s red-shifted, meaning it’s traveling away from us quite quickly. 

Blue-shifting, where the spectrum of a star moves the other way, indicates the opposite. 

So if I had millions of years to watch the Andromeda galaxy approaching us I could say it was going at such and such a speed when I started looking and is now going faster, being sped up by gravity. 

If I calculated how much faster I’d know how much force the gravity had exerted and be able to say how massive our galaxy was. 

Same as I could estimate the gravity and mass of Earth by dropping a rock and seeing how fast it got as it fell. 

In a nutshell if you do this for our two galaxies you’d find out they both massed a lot more than the stars in them would suggest they did. 

Now that’s not a problem, we already know a lot more hydrogen and gas is floating around than the stars contain. 

Add to that, the year before Jan Oort, for whom the Oort Cloud was named, had tweaked to a similar idea, that the mass of our own galactic plane was much larger than we thought. 

Problem was, his calculations were erroneous and Zwicky himself was off by an order of magnitude. 

For a long while, because our data and modeling just wasn’t sufficient to really nail it down probably, the idea kind of hung out in limbo. 

Everyone agreed there was a lot more matter than what star contained but this was somewhat shrug worthy. 

Seeing gas clouds of hydrogen is a bit tricky but conceptually straight forward. 

Everything tends to absorb or reflect light, and any given atom or molecule has certain characteristics of which frequencies it does this for. 

So if I’m looking at a star I know there’s some gas and dust between me and it, and if I look at one twice as far away I’d expect, on average, there’s be about twice as much. 

Start looking at thousands of them and you can start calculating pretty exactly how much gas and dust is between you and each of them and get a good idea how much junk is lying around in between and even its distribution. 

We’ve gotten way, way better at this as the years rolled by, and way better at measuring the mass of galaxies, and it started getting very obvious that there just wasn’t enough mass out there, in terms of stars and gas and dust, to equal the gravitational force we saw. 

The discrepancy was just way too big and way too concrete to ignore anymore. 

This gives us our first two properties of dark matter, because we know it has to have mass, or at least exert gravity, generally considered the same thing, and we know it has to be transparent to light. 

Because it isn’t sucking up visual light or any of those other frequencies like radio we look at. 

Or at least, if it does interact with light, it’s got to do it very minimally, either by being compacted into huge dense chunks or just interacting so little we don’t notice, being very weakly interacting. 

That’s how things stood in 1980, when I was born and Vera Rubin submitted her results on the galactic rotation problem showing rather firmly that most galaxies were carrying about 6 times more mass than we could account for from stars and gas and dust to be spinning at the rates they were. 

This wasn’t a groundbreaking and surprising paper exactly, it had been suspected for a while, but she had compiled such a compelling hard argument and collection of data that it wasn’t so much a nail in the coffin as a stake through the heart of the idea that it might just be a mundane source of mass we were estimating badly. 

This was hard, she’d used the best modern equipment of the time to measure this stuff and spent years compiling it, and every model agreed that for stars to orbit their galaxies like they were doing there needed to be a lot more mass than we could otherwise detect, either because it was emitting light or blocking it. 

Now a lot of options were put forth, we had discovered neutrinos for instance, they’d been theorized since the 1930’s and first detected in 1946, and had some of those expected properties. 

Neutrinos don’t interact with virtually anything, that’s why they can glide untouched through entire planets. 

The problem with using them for dark matter is two fold. 

First neutrinos come about essentially as the byproduct of nuclear reactions. 

When you get a nuclear decay or a fusion or fission reaction some of that excess energy flies off as a neutrino. 

Several trillion of them pass through you from the sun every second as a result of the fusion of hydrogen into helium. 

That’s the problem though, only a small fraction of the mass of a star is converted into neutrinos, and hydrogen is hands down the most abundant material in the Universe, meaning most mass hasn’t gone and been fused and produced neutrinos yet. 

So neutrinos can’t make up the majority of the mass and energy of the Universe because they simply haven’t been produced in large enough amounts yet. 

And since they fly off virtually unimpeded you can expect those from far and ancient corners of the Universe to arrive intact to our detectors. 

So there’s no reason to think they got produced in huge quantities at some point early in the Universe and we can’t see them now. 

That’s the other problem. 

Neutrinos have very little mass compared to their total energy, they move within spitting distance of the speed of light. 

And virtually nothing stops them. 

So they ought not to be hanging around galaxies. 

They ought to be fairly evenly distributed throughout the Universe, more even then photons since light does get absorbed by a lot of things. 

That’s our third property of dark matter. 

It can’t be moving too quickly or it wouldn’t be clumped up around galaxies. 

It’s not evenly distributed throughout the Universe, it clumps around galaxies a lot. 

That means it can’t be moving too fast on average. 

The escape velocity of galaxies is higher than Earth’s or the solar system but it’s nowhere near the speed of light. 

So we can assume this missing mass isn’t moving near the speed of light like neutrinos do, or even at decently relativistic speeds, or it would be spread out a lot more evenly, whereas the models that show it exists by making galaxies spin at the wrong speed indicate its spread out in a spherical halo around the galaxy. 

Since it clearly doesn’t interact with light or normal mass there are no collisions making particles of dark matter slow down and tend toward a disc-around-a-sphere distribution like many galaxies and solar systems exhibit. 

Gravity would slow them down as they try to pass us and speed them up as they neared, so you’d get nice orbits for those moving slow enough to stay captured, but they will not generally clump into balls like normal matter does to form planets and stars because they’re not colliding with anything to average out their momentum. 

So that is 3 properties so far, they interact with gravity, because they exert it on things and we can see it clumping around galaxies. 

They don’t interact with light or normal matter, or at least do so even less than neutrinos do. 

And they do not have much speed. 

We might as well add a fourth too, that they demonstrably make up the majority of the mass in the Universe. 

So that is the state of play for the last couple generations, we have a learned a bit more but mostly why various alternative explanations don’t work. 

Here are some of the more common ones and their strengths and flaws: Wimps – Short for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle, this is the current favored candidate for dark matter. 

You could think of this like a neutrino, though in the way a glacier creeping across the landscape is like a snowball. 

Which is to say they are both made of ice and moving, but the one is much faster and smaller. 

If a Neutrino is a weakly interacting low mass particle, a WIMP is any even less interacting heavy mass particle. 

Neutrino mass is about a millionth of an electron’s mass and billionth of a proton or neutron’s mass. 

WIMPS are thought to be as massive as a proton to maybe a thousand times more massive, currently. 

Nor would they have to be a single type of particle, there could be a whole particle zoo of these which would make sense since they’re the majority of matter. 

After all there are 6 flavors of quarks and 6 types of leptons of which the electron is one and the neutrino is too, well actually three. 

Of the four fundamental forces, gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear force, leptons can interact with all but the strong force, whereas quarks interact with all four. 

But the gauge bosons, the particles that transmit those forces, usually are said to only interact with the force type they transmit and gravity, though gravity is always kinda tricky to talk about at the subatomic scale. 

Very loosely though we’d say each particle has traits that let it interact with a given type of force and some particles are just missing those. 

I sometimes think of it like a module or receiver that lets it pickup that forces signal, as it were, and apparently most of the matter in the universe didn’t come with that installed for anything other than gravity. 

Gravity is a weird force, it is way weaker than the other three and has defied a lot of out attempts to unite the forces in Grand Unified Theories. 

It’s fairly popular nowadays to say it’s not entirely real or maybe not a force, but I reject that. 

Not because I disagree with the general reasoning but simply because gravity is the first of the four physical forces we encountered and studied, so if we stop calling it a force to me that would like having a definition of automobile that excluded the old Model-T. 

Keeping it simple though, WIMPs would be particle that just don’t have the device installed to listen to those other three forces, or have only a very cheap system that barely hears them. 

Most other particles have the receivers installed for one, two, or all three of those forces. 

I find this analogy makes it easier to understand why apparently most of the particles in the Universe are lacking this trait. 

Now again the WIMP is the lead candidate, so it’s got more in its favor then against it. 

Starting with quite a few models predicting something like them ought to exist. 

The big thing against them is trying to detect the wretched things. 

We’ve mostly managed to figure out what they aren’t. 

Like neutrinos, WIMPS ought to be flying around and through us all the time, but it is kind of hard to detect something whose only known property is it does not interact with anything for you to detect. 

I mean if you had a box full of the stuff you could shine a flashlight right through it and see nothing, wave your hand through it and feel nothing, and while you could detect it by feeling its mass when you picked up the box, they would just slide right through the box, which couldn’t have kept them inside in the first place anyway. 

The big longstanding competitor to WIMPs was MACHOs, Massive Compact Halo Objects, MACHOs and WIMPs are fairly inspired acronyms since they are quite descriptive. 

Where the Wimp is a tiny particle that doesn’t interact with virtually anything, a MACHO is a huge macroscopic object that just doesn’t emit much light. 

This is everyone’s favorite first suggestion too. 

Brown Dwarf stars, big gas giants, neutron stars that have cooled down, and black holes. 

Now Halo is important in there because it means the objects are out in the halo of the galaxy. 

Remember we need a distribution of matter that implies the missing mass enfolds the galaxy as a loose sphere. 

A MACHO definitely absorbs light, it just doesn’t particularly emit it. 

They’re very dense compared to dust clouds so we’d expect they don’t block much light. 

This has generally not been a popular solution with the people studying the problem, but more the solution popular with folks not studying it, since it basically represents folks saying “Do we actually need to make up some freakish new material composing the supermajority of the Universe?” In a nutshell, especially these days as we’ve compiled more data and more accurate data, the answer is yes. 

Now there is a lot of reasons this doesn’t work, many of them highly technical, but let me offer a more intuitively simple one that’s a variation of the one I use with the Fermi Paradox I call the Time Elapse Argument, or TEA, because I like acronyms too. 

If I see a weird looking galaxy a billion light years away, and know that it looked like that a billion years ago, then spot a similar one a similar distance away in a different direction and another in third direction I can say that those are unrelated, if artificial in origin, and furthermore that in a volume with a radius of a billion light years we’d expect 3 of them. 

So if I look out to a radius of 2 billion light years, which would have 2-cubed or eight times the volume, I ought to expect about 8 times as many of them or about 24 of them. 

Going out to 3 times the distance I’d expect 27 times as many or 81 of them, give or take. 

Going out to, say, five billion I’d expect to find about 400 of these things. 

But if they are artificial in origin, you’d think they’d be more common as the universe got older and more folks arose to build one. 

As time elapses you can argue they should be more common, so the further away you look, and the further back in time you look, the less common they should be. 

If you are seeing a phenomena which appears evenly distributed throughout the universe in space, and therefore time, it is not too likely to be artificial in origin. 

This works quite well for a lot phenomena folks have jumped the gun on and attributed to aliens, which has often included dark matter. 

But it also includes a lot of MACHOs. 

Planets take time to form, there are more of them now than they used to be… which is a good caveat to the time elapse argument since we can’t assume just because something is now more common that it is artificial, just that if it is not more common nowadays it probably is not artificial. 

Planets take time to form, Neutrons stars take time to form as a star must form, live, and die, then cool a lot to being invisible to us. 

So we should expect that a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away it ought to have a not formed so much of a Massive Compact Object Halo. 

Weirdly what we instead see at huge distance away and back in time are things like dwarf galaxies composed of mostly dark matter instead. 

But we certainly are detecting dark matter around ancient galaxies absurdly far away in time and space. 

So that along with it not being neutrinos tells us that Dark Matter is also old. 

It is old, it is cold, and it is massive. 

As best as we can tell it has stayed constant in quantity this whole time too so it presumably does not have a half-life or get created by interactions between normal matter. 

There are tons of other weaknesses for it being MACHOS but I think that is the one that is easiest to understand without needing lots more science and technology background on it. 

The next candidate is the Axion. 

This particle was first theorized to deal with some problems in strong nuclear force interactions. 

It is very like the WIMP, except it isn’t heavy. 

Whereas WIMPS can be thought of as heavy version of neutrinos, weighing as much or more as a proton whereas neutrinos weigh in at about a billionth of that, the axion weighs even less than the neutrino, anywhere from about the same mass to a millionth of neutrino mass. 

Now the axion is thought to be a particle with very tiny mass and no electric charge, but is also thought to switch into photons in magnetic fields. 

Axions are nice candidates since they are hard to detect but not nearly as hard as WIMPs, both from their properties and that they ought to be somewhere between a billion to a billion, billion times more common. 

But while it would make a huge difference to cosmology if it were WIMPS or Axions making up dark matter they are pretty similar objects. 

Theories for Axions do place their creation all the way back to the early time of the Universe too. 

In some ways I would say the Axion beats the WIMP out as a candidate for dark matter in the sense that it will be a lot easier to detect, so focusing on proving it or disproving either gets us the answer or gets it out of the way. 

And we have a number of experiments just getting under way or coming on line soon that ought to settle the matter. 

We’re going to skip the Kaluza-Klein Particle, an option for dark matter under string-theory. 

It has not been ruled out yet but it is supposed to be easier to detect than most of the others, relatively speaking of course, and we haven’t got a whiff of it in the experiments we expected to get a whiff from. 

I will also skip the gravitino, a particle predicted under Supersymettry, they were a great candidate but the blows to super-symmetry in recent years demote them I think. 

Similarly MOND, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, loosely the idea that gravity doesn’t fall off as the inverse square at very long distances, has fallen strongly out of favor so we will skip it too. 

That leaves our last big candidate, tiny primordial black holes. 

Normal black holes just don’t form enough to account for all that mass, but a lot of our notions about the moments right after the big bang gives us some cause to think lots of small black holes might have formed then. 

Now if Stephen Hawking is right, that black holes evaporate with time, with the smaller ones evaporating much faster, via the Hawking Radiation we talked about in the video on micro-black holes and Hawking Radiation, then we can put a minimum mass on those. 

Small black holes don’t live long and are very bright. 

And so not only would the smallest of them be gone by now but they ought to have left a ton of radiation around all over the universe making its way here. 

If he’s wrong then no problem at all. 

A small black hole with no Hawking Radiation is a WIMP for all practical purposes, one would fly right through you without you even noticing. 

But if they do evaporate, we can say they have to mass at least a hundred megatons or they wouldn’t be around anymore. 

One with a mass less than that wouldn’t have lived this long and would have been quite bright. 

We can push that up a bit too, because there is dark matter in our own solar system, some models say now it might be denser than expected, possible a whole large asteroids worth scattered about, and if that’s the case we can put an upper limit on how much radiation they could be spitting out without us noticing them. 

I’d say realistically we would see them if they massed less than about 100 billion tons, because that at that point you’d expect them to give off a bit less than a megawatt each of radiation and number about a million. 

If they massed less they would each be way brighter and more numerous. 

Chop a black hole into ten small ones each of equal mass and they would each be a hundred times brighter than the original and again ten times more numerous. 

I’d have difficulty imaging us missing things brighter than a megawatt and more numerous than asteroids. 

100 billion ton black holes would be about as bright as small asteroids and about as numerous. 

Not that they would be giving off visible light, it would be gamma, but I’d have a hard time imagining us missing even the 100 billion tons ones in gamma. 

Smaller than that and I’d say no way. 

Bigger than that is an option but not a lot bigger or we would detect them messing with planetary orbits and picking up accretion disks. 

Now what’s interesting is that while there is cosmic microwave background radiation, there’s also infrared and xray background radiation, and recently NASA’s Alexander Kashlinsky and others noticed that there was a lot of matchup in those two, with the most obvious candidate for such a match being primordial black holes. 

At the same time we have just recently gotten our first detections of gravitational waves from the LIGO detector, our first sight of black holes and not just things glowing while they fell into them, and it has been suggested some of those detections were of the merger of primordial black holes. 

I will link an article in the video description from a couple months ago from Shannon Hall at Space dot Com discussing this more, but while primordial black holes have been a solid if minor contender for dark matter for a long while, their stock seems to be on the rise the last couple years while quite a few of the others have lost steam during that same time. 

So WIMPs remain the strong first place, and I’d say axions after that, but I would promote primordial black holes to third place and we can pursue both them and axions aggressively in the next decade to either prove them or disprove them. 

There are tons of other dark matter candidates, from the plausible and credible if minor candidates to the downright zany, but those are the big ones and I also mentioned discussing some uses of Dark Matter so if I don’t get to those now the video will get too long. 

The first and most obvious use is just as filler material. 

If you can find some substance or field that lets you interact with dark matter, then there’s lots of uses for something that basically is just mass with no interactions. 

We’ve discussed quite a few megatructures on the channel that use most of their mass just for gravity, like shell and discworlds, and we would usually assume you would use hydrogen and helium for this job, since they are so abundant compared to other elements like carbon and iron. 

Dark matter would for instance be even better. 

You don’t have to worry about undergoing any weird transitions into things like metallic hydrogen or start up fusion if you stick too much in one place. 

Dark stars, hypothetical stars composed mostly of dark matter that might have been around when the Universe was young, are thought to have been able to get a big as solar system. 

Since some hypothetical forms of dark matter are their own anti-particle, you’d expect the rare collisions of two of them to produce a matter-anti-matter reaction generating light. 

This light is why we call them stars, or dark matter stars or dark stars. 

You probably wouldn’t want to use dark matter as a dense filler in such a case, though it would depend on how often those collisions were happening, but that would make that an excellent power supply too. 

Obviously we have no concept for a material or field that could contain dark matter but if we did have one, and if dark matter was its own anti-particle, you could imagine sticking it in a big balloon or bladder you could squeeze tighter to make more collisions occur or expand out to decrease those. 

Giving you essentially a massively plentiful source of energy equal to antimatter but way safer, easy to throttle, and naturally abundant, super abundant even. 

The Bussard ramjet we discussed way back in the Interstellar Colonization video probably doesn’t work, it seems to take more energy to sweep up the hydrogen it runs across in space and fuse it into helium than it would produce in thrust, BUT if you could do that with dark matter and it was its own anti-particle you’ve an amazingly mass efficient fuel supply evenly distributed throughout the galaxy that practically has a sign on it saying perfect ‘rocket fuel’. 

Ships able to gather that up as they plowed by ought to have no problem going quite close to the speed of light and not needing to worry about running out fuel. 

If it isn’t its own anti-particle then we can still use it, and not just for filler mass, it could be dumped into black holes as power supplies for instance. 

Also I joked once about what I call the Dark Telegraph, which would essentially be an ultradense line of matter between two places where like any massive object it contracted space. 

Keeping something like that from collapsing on itself is a lot easier with something like dark matter, you could send a beam between relay points, or even two overlapping beams going opposite directions, and unlike normal matter you can send your laser message right down that beam without needing to worry it would scatter. 

It’s not actually faster than light, but from a practical standpoint it would be since along that path space would be contracted so the message would get there faster than normal. 

If we cannot find an easy way to manipulate the stuff though, there is again the black hole route. 

Dark matter would be eaten by a black hole whose event horizon they crossed. 

Event horizons are quite tiny compared to galaxies but in the long term, like we contemplated in the Black Hole farming video, you’d expect black holes to eat a lot of them, gaining their mass energy and angular momentum, which we discussed using in that video. 

So there are actually some uses for the stuff inside the realm of plausible science, albeit we have to stretch a bit. 

As we learn more about the stuff we may learn other uses for it or way to manipulate it, and I’d say we can be optimistic on that score for now, though we also need to be patient, it isn’t likely we will crack the mysteries of dark matter for some years. 

And it is mysterious stuff, though hopefully a bit less so now we’re done for the day. 

Next week is going to be a look at asteroid mining and we’ll look at some confusion about both this topic and asteroids in general. 

We’ll probably be spending a fair amount of time in the near future discussing colonizing the solar system. 

We will be coming back to discuss cosmology quite a lot before 2016 is over, but I am going to do a poll again. 

The winner will be next, next week’s video and odds are most of the next few will be from the runners up. 

I’m thinking about switching this over to the website, IsaacArthur.net, to just be an ongoing thing but it will be a Youtube poll this week Here are the options: First, a look at Cryptocurrency, both in the emerging use of it in things like bitcoin and in how it and related concepts might impact civilizations down the road. 

Second, a similar topic, folks have been asking me to discuss the concept of post-scarcity societies for a while, and explain what that actually means and what some of the implications of that might be. 

For the third option I thought about taking a deeper look at the concept of a Technological Singularity. 

We kind of brushed past it in the Transhumanism video and a deeper look at this idea and artificial intelligence seems appropriate. 

For the fourth option we’ll take a more detailed look at SETI, the search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, I’d meant to give it an overview in the video on Tabby’s star but that got almost entirely cut out to look at the anomaly in more detail. 

Quick channel update, as mentioned last week the website, IsaacArthur.net, is now up, and all the audio is now available to listen to or download at soundcloud. 

Regarding foreign language subtitles, which I mentioned last time I’ve been considering, a subscriber pointed out Youtube has an option I could enable to let viewers submit those so I went ahead and did that, and on screen is a link to a quick 2 minute video from youtube that explains how to do that if you want to, and since each video already has subtitles it does have an expedited methods where the timing is already there and you can just click auto-translate if you like then just fix the blatant translations errors. 

My only request is that no matter how funny some of those automated botches might be you resist the urge to leave them un-fixed for the humor value. 

Changing sentence structure or wording to be more appropriate to that tongue I will leave to people’s good taste and judgment, this channel’s audience usually exhibits a hefty surplus of both. 

Okay on that note, don’t forget to hit the like button if you enjoyed the video, and share it with others. 

Questions and comments are welcome, and you can try out some of the other topics on the channel. 

Thanks for watching, and I’ll see you next time!

Consciousness and Identity
---
  
2016-08-12  
https://youtu.be/DEyiugDVQ6o  

---

So our topic today is Consciousness and Identity. 

This is something we’ve looked at before and I felt we should spend some more time on, and so this is going to be mostly a concept video where we overview a lot of the stranger approaches to this topic. 

Toward the end we’ll look at the notion of how immortality or very long lifetimes can potentially mess with personal identity and even explore a somewhat strange solution to the Fermi Paradox involving identity that we’ve not looked at before. 

But we should do away with the preliminaries first. 

There is no definition of either consciousness or identity that is universally agreed on by philosophers, which is a bit amusing since both are things that everybody knows what they are. 

I am me, you are you, my cat Prospero is my cat Prospero, though I’m not sure he knows that’s his name or just some noise I make when I want his attention, which he’ll sometimes deign to grant me. 

Of course when you get around to it that’s probably what names began as anyway, a specific noise made to get a specific person’s attention. 

We all know what identity is. 

We all know what consciousness is. 

But if you try to slap a proper definition on it, things tend to get complicated. 

I sometimes wonder if trying to describe identity in terms of concepts is like trying to describe smells in terms of colors or sounds. 

Some things you just can’t describe without resorting to a circular definition, which is a definition that is circular. 

We know people change with time, most of your cells are replaced gradually and those themselves routinely take in fuel and material to replace damaged components. 

There are probably some atoms left in your body from when you were born but odds are good a lot of those left your body at some point and have since returned by coincidence. 

But while the child often differs from the man or woman they will grow to be, we know they are the same person. 

We just know it. 

We’re probably wrong but it hardly matters because it’s like free will, if it doesn’t exist it makes precious little difference if we incorrectly think it does since that thought was predestined to happen. 

If you don’t have free will then you don’t make decisions any more than a rock does and you don’t have opinions any more than a rock does. 

And if identity isn’t something more wide spectrum than your exact position of atoms at this moment, then there isn’t any you to have opinions since the you who thought them up wasn’t you, it was someone else, and not the same person who was listening when I began this sentence, or whoever it was who began that sentence, since that wouldn’t have been me. 

Such ruminations are absurd… they might actually be right… but they’re still absurd in the sense that there’s no reason to contemplate them since if true they’d mean you’re not contemplating anything anyway since there’s no you to be doing the contemplating. 

So for the purpose of this video we will assume this video has a purpose, and that I exist as a distinct entity and so do all of you. 

I can doubt many things but I can’t doubt my own existence since if I don’t exist there wouldn’t be anyone to be doing the doubting, which doesn’t prove I am thinking or exist, but it does prove there’s no point doubting your identity, since you’re incapable of doubt if you don’t exist. 

Thus, since I think, I am. 

We’ve been whacking our foreheads against this wall for centuries, it’s occupied the minds of some of our greatest philosophers and to this day we’ve got no conclusive answer. 

So it isn’t one we’ll answer today. 

Quite to the contrary I’m just going to throw in some extra mental confusion by seeing how science and concepts from science fiction have made this whole set of topics even worse. 

I mean there is a reason why this is called the existential crisis series, if you don’t want some aspirin by the time this episode is over I probably haven’t done my job. 

So we know people change with time, both in their software and hardware. 

It’s not just addition either, you lose stuff, cells die, atoms switch out, memories get forgotten. 

We usually say that if its gradual and it maintains continuity in the process the identity has been maintained. 

I plant a seed, that seeds becomes a sapling and grows to be a tree, throughout that process identity is maintained. 

Even though there’s few if any atoms left over from that first seedling. 

If I chop it down and make a table, and a bunch of firewood that becomes ash that becomes fertilizer for my garden that become vegetables I eat on that table, well, identity would seem not to be maintained. 

I could maybe argue that the table was kind of sort of the tree still, but I can’t take that too far, not to the point of claiming my salad from my garden fertilized with wood ash was, because that path leads to madness. 

You then argue that the tree, coming from a seed from a previous tree, is actually that tree, except that claim is a lot less crazy since at least its contribution was significant, in terms of DNA. 

It would still get confusing since that tree came from a tree too, which would then have an equally valid claim as the grandfather tree of being the tree I cut down and made a table and salad out of. 

Your parents have an even better claim, under the default definition of the people whose DNA you got and who raised you. 

And we know identity really is blurry there too, because you did pick up a lot your personality from the people who raised you, and a lot of the physical traits of whoever bred you, and both if those were the same people. 

But if they weren’t, most of us would say these days that it was the folks who raised you who have the better claim on your identity. 

We tend to think the software matters more these days. 

So if I clone you it’s definitely not you, it’s just a younger twin sibling with none of your memories, or maybe arguably your kid, via parthenogenesis, depending on how you look at it. 

What if I duplicated you? 

Okay, now we have a copy of you complete with memories. 

Now we know in time you and they will diverge, and arguably count as separate people right from the first moment, after all software matters most maybe but hardware is a big deal. 

Now the hardware is mostly identical, if I copy you into a full grown clone body, but it’s not getting the same sensory inputs or experiences anymore. 

Of course it could be more than that. 

If I duplicate my mind onto a different body, say a professional basketball player, I won’t know how to play basketball, but I’ll be better at it then I am now and I’m sure being way taller than average will alter my view of the world more than just literally, though that’s enough. 

Now if I just switched bodies with him, we would view it that way, we switched bodies, not minds, the body is the inferior partner in the pair. 

We wouldn’t say, if Bob and Todd switched bodies, “Hey look, there’s Bob with Todd’s Brain, we’d say Todd is in Bob’s body. 

If that stayed that way long enough we’d probably say Todd was now that body too. 

Maybe it’s a whole new identity, but there is no one with a better claim to that identity. 

And that’s probably important, and will be when we look at this with the Fermi Paradox in mind at the end. 

Maybe Todd isn’t actually Todd anymore, but nobody has a better claim to be him. 

Maybe you aren’t who you were ten years ago, but nobody has a better claim to that identity then you do. 

Most of us would agree that copy wasn’t actually us, but it was a pretty good approximation, and if a friend died and was so duplicated, complete with memories, we’d be pretty justified in treating them as we did the friend. 

A lot of folks would say it was the same person. 

That’s why concepts like mind uploading or dumping yourself into a clone body tend to be popular routes to immortality in fiction. 

So I’m on the table getting ready for an upload or transfer after which I’ll die. 

In one reality that’s exactly what happens, I’ve got some untreatable illness and we’re going to clone or print me a new body, or maybe stick me in an android body or upload me to a virtual reality. 

And that happens and the new me wakes up, takes a sad glance at dead me on the table, and probably decides it is me. 

It’s a perfect clone of mind and body. 

Now we handled a similar case when we looked at the Simulation Hypothesis, but we went through that quickly. 

At this point a computer monitor flicks on and a digital copy of me pops in proclaiming itself the true me, and downloads itself into an android. 

That android severs ties with the digital self and now we’ve got three of me standing around glaring at each other. 

Now because I am the sort of person who has contingencies plans for identity crises like this they actually all know the plan for such a weird scenario and throw 24 of the 26 letters of the alphabet into a hat, not an I for Isaac or an R for Rascally Rabbits, each pull one and pick an extra new name beginning with that letter to be used for internal conversations and official documents. 

They randomly divide my possessions. 

Of course what they do about friends and family is a little trickier. 

In a very real way we are our friends and family and various professional or social obligations. 

It would be nice not to have to divide those up, certainly not initially but that could cause a lot of confusion, even if we made it very clear to everyone which was which. 

So what if someone found a way to keep us linked together so we could share memories? 

Now this isn’t quite the same thing as a hive mind, where there is one single collective mind running everything, and all else are drones, but it raises the problem which we’ll get to in a moment. 

We could throw in a lot more folks too, like they cut my brain out and stuck it in a brain dead person who’d bequeathed their body to science, and raises the issue of if I’d want to have cosmetic surgery to better look like my old self. 

That might get pretty intensive too. 

Let’s say a woman had her mind put in a male body, is she a man or a woman? 

Should she get gender re-assignment surgery? 

Or should she spend some time as a man to experience that? 

We’d usually say that’s entirely her choice, but if it were us making the decision as an individual, in terms of what we’d do, which would you do? 

So Hive minds. 

These come in a lot of forms, from the single mind running the bodies like drones to where everyone has simply done some sort of linkage to share some or all experiences, to a sort of loose internet that expedited chatting between them and allowed important material to be shared out automatically. 

We always see this as multiple bodies, whether its one mind or many, but it could go the other way too. 

Imagine in the future we’ve reached a point where we couldn’t have more people. 

Earth’s reached its comfortable maximum and our colonies near us have too, and we just can’t migrate new people where there is space. 

And everyone is functionally immortal. 

Now folks occasionally still do die, suicide or whatever, so we still get some new kids. 

Indeed maybe you can only have a new kid if someone volunteers to die. 

But a lot of folks who are very old, in terms of experience not body age, firmly believe we need to be bringing in new fresh minds, and at a faster rate than is occurring. 

Maybe they even get together, say 1000 of them, and agree to a lottery, someone dies from that group and a child replaces them. 

The person with the short straw agrees to die when the kid is born, having nine more months of fun and a big death slash birth day party on that day and the kid is named after them. 

A bit bleak but pretty civilized. 

Now the question is who raises them? 

After all the person with the best claim is gone. 

Many might remove themselves from the contest, they might have an election, they might have a lottery. 

But someone suggests that since many of them are transhumans with very accelerated thinking, and many are totally digital entities on a computer, that they could just build a mom and dad android where they all voted on each major action, and agreed to a general set of behaviors while piloting the robot. 

So the kid ends up with a few hundred people raising them as a collective pair of minds, with some guidelines to avoid either entity acting like someone with a very severe and real case of multiple-personality disorder. 

That way those who want to get to enjoy every minute of being a parent and the kid gets the benefit of having hundreds of parents most of whom might have thousands of years of life experience. 

It’s a bit weird, but I’d tend to guess the big threat to the child would be getting spoiled horribly. 

Similarly we’ve all got a long list of things we want to do, many of which can’t realistically be pursued simultaneously. 

Now while an immortal person has time to do everything we are also impatient. 

Maybe you’ve got three things you really want to do and get yourself cloned twice, and each of you picks one of those three things. 

Say one of you wanted to focus on running a business, another wanted a family, and a third wanted to go explore other solar systems. 

You agree to exchange memories every so often so you can all enjoy this. 

You know you’ll diverge with time to become truly separate people if you don’t, and maybe will too anyway. 

Now that’s all fine and well, but now another person comes along and decides to make tons of himself, all to operate a giant business empire, with each individual copy going off to train to be an accountant, a marketing expert, a lawyer, and so on. 

This entity employs no one but themselves, as it were. 

Now with all those different life experiences you’d expect this might fragment but let’s say it doesn’t. 

Society doesn’t really approve of this mega-personality of a million clones but they don’t break the law, they work hard, they pay their taxes, and many of them are out constantly doing volunteer work. 

But now a big election is coming up and they all decide to register to vote, all one million of them. 

And they are definitely planning to bloc vote. 

What do you do? 

Now at the same time one of them goes out and does commit a crime, a pretty big wave of them too, many murders, and turns himself in, ready to take the consequences. 

Who do you charge? 

This seems like it would need to depend a lot on how tight that network was. 

If they really all totally separate people, then only one person committed the crimes and the others are either innocent or maybe accomplices. 

It would also seem like they all get to vote. 

But if they’re still one big mind, then they are all guilty and shouldn’t get even one vote since felons normally don’t get to. 

There’s probably going to be a very gray area in between, where you can see evidence of a single mind and evidence of separate personalities too. 

This isn’t a scifi novel where the answer is going to be painted as very clear, simple, black and white at the end. 

So I’d actually encourage you to go with your gut instinct for the moment, whichever that is, individuals each with a vote or a collective mind that is guilty of murder. 

Let’s tack a different direction for the moment, and we’ll come back, but keep your answer in mind. 

If we are the sum of our experiences more than anything else, than adding those or subtracting those changes the person. 

Let’s say we have the ability to edit memories to, like remove a traumatic experience. 

Some would argue you shouldn’t do that, that we are the product of those events, good and ill. 

Others might agree in general but would say, look this kid just saw her parents brutally murdered in front of her, we don’t need to remove that death, but we can at least just cut the minute she saw that. 

She’ll still remember they are dead. 

And that’s kind of hard to argue with, I mean the big objection would seem to be that it is a kid, and we are deciding for her, even if she’s quite happy to proceed with that she’s still not an adult. 

Flip side, what about adding memories to a kid, like sitting through a math lecture? 

Or for an adult even, if someone sits through a math lecture for you and transfer that to you and many others, are you now partially her, because you have those memories? 

Is that really any different than watching a recording of that math lecture, only in Ultra-high-definition, as it were? Bit of a tricky notion, since it would then imply some of my identity is being imprinted on you right now, and we know there’s some truth to this, we do inherit a lot of our personality from our parents and what they imprinted on us. 

We definitely do get our personalities, a big chunk of our identity, altered by those we interact with. 

Let’s go in one more direction. 

If we are the sum of our memories, and I clone myself, mind and all, and it goes and commits a crime right away, it would be very hard to argue I’m not guilty too, just because I didn’t pull the trigger and don’t remember the event. 

We might even need to use an affirmative defense, which is when you have to prove something rather than have it proved against you in a court. 

Like Bob shot Todd and that can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, because he says he did for one thing, but he says it was in self-defense and he now needs to show this is true. 

We argue the clone was mentally unbalanced perhaps, or that the motive for the murder came after the process, that sort of thing. 

If we fail we might both get jail time or the needle. 

The same would go for if someone deleted their memory of a crime. 

No memory, no guilt, some would say, but not the US courts. 

We’ve got some legal precedents for amnesia of a crime. 

In People vs Hibbler, 1971, a man with chronic alcoholism who didn’t remember committing forgery was convicted of it, and in Lester vs State in Tennessee in 1963 a murder conviction was upheld even though the defendant didn’t remember committing the crime. 

And in neither case was the ruling based on an assumption the person was lying, though the jury or court might have thought they were. 

That doesn’t necessarily mean they decided correctly though, but that is the precedent in US law if you’re wondering. 

Now amnesia can be used as a mitigating factor in sentencing, that’s separate, but the law hasn’t really had to deal too much yet with the idea that identity might be a mobile and flexible concept. 

Let me throw another out there for consideration. 

You are abducted by a man who just committed murder, he transfers his last year of memories into you, including the crime and original motivation for it, and adds your last year to his own, deleting the actual last year for both of you from your minds. 

This process is not reversible and the irritating thing is you have the motivations for the crime now too and you think the victim had it coming. 

So who do we charge with the murder, and for that matter the abduction and mental assault? 

You with the memories and motivation for murder, and the kidnapping of yourself, or them? 

Who remember none of that except being kidnapped? 

Let’s make this worse by adding in a sympathy aspect. 

He picked you because you were the passenger in the car that hit his kid, and you best friend was driving, and wasn’t paying attention because he was messing around with the radio. 

You lied for your friend, saying the kid jumped into the road, and nobody really believed you but it raised reasonable doubt and he didn’t get convicted. 

Now hitting someone on accident, no matter how negligent you were, is not murder but the father saw it that way and wanted revenge. 

He killed your friend and switched memories of it with you. 

Now if this was a novel I’d probably have it turn out to be that you were the one who actually was driving and your friend took the fall for you, and you lied to protect them, and you and the kid’s dad would end the story staring at each other in absolute horror, and either shooting yourselves in self-disgust or shooting each other in blind hatred. 

It’s not novel though so we are still left trying to figure out who to charge with a crime, and now which ones. 

We’ve got perjury, murder, and abduction, not to mention whatever taking someone’s memories away forcibly or giving them forcefully would qualify as, which I suspect would end up being viewed as something at least as bad as rape. 

Now insanity defenses and mitigating circumstances can all play a role afterward but you first have to decide who is actually getting charged, and with what. 

This is just as bad with hive mind scenarios where the individual identity is still maintained. 

There’s, say, twenty of you who share a communal mind, exchanging memories and able to mentally talk to each other, but still essentially unique people. 

The memories aren’t shared as fully perhaps, so you don’t converge entirely into one personality. 

One of the twenty joined because he’s got anger issues and being part of a loose group mind helps him keep that in check, and one day he experiences one of his score of mental kindred getting abused and it triggers him to go kill the abuser. 

Now in and of itself, that’s not complex, it wouldn’t be that weird to have a friend who related a crime against them that sent that person off to go get revenge on their friend’s behalf. 

Their friend didn’t ask them to, and so is guilty of no crime, and revenge might come up as a mitigating factor in sentencing but the murder still took place. 

It is a bit different if you’re sharing a memory though. 

For instance if someone attacks me and I kill them during that, that’s self-defense, if I go chasing after them afterwards, now its murder. 

Shooting someone in the middle of an argument is not the same crime as walking out to your car and getting a gun, then coming back and shooting them. 

It adds premeditation. 

But if your hive-mind buddy is busy thinking how much they want to kill that person and that’s leaking into your head with vivid clarity, it starts getting a bit dubious what the situation is. 

I suspect such contemplations will be nightmares for any judge who has to make the first ruling on cases like that, I bounced something similar off a friend of mine who is a judge and noted for having a good head for that kind of esoteric thinking and she just laughed and said she had no idea. 

Law and science fiction make some very interesting concepts and conundrums that I feel tend to get neglected in the genre, or treated over-simplistically. 

Wasted opportunity I think. 

Whudunnit Murders are certainly popular in scifi but not so much the actual trials. 

So I go to the doctor and get a bad diagnosis, its cancer, its malignant, and I’ve got two years left tops. 

The next day I wake up and they tell me it’s the year 2100 AD, and the original me had a memory transfer done and meant to update it till the moment of his death, while I was being grown or stored in stasis, but they found out the clone, me, actually had a fatal genetic weakness pop up. 

He, the original, had me stored on ice until they found a cure. 

He also got very bitter and sometime a year later shot someone and then died in a shoot out with the police. 

Now I don’t have those memories, but we’ve already argued that just deleting the memories of a crime or even the motivations for it too, doesn’t necessarily make you innocent of it. 

But let’s say you think right now I am, what if they come up with the big black box that had my memories all the way up to death on it. 

If I am innocent right now, can we actually argue I’d stop being innocent if I downloaded those into my brain? 

And if that does make me guilty, wouldn’t that also make anyone else who downloaded them guilty, whether it was voluntary or not? 

Like with our passenger who got abducted by the father of the kid his best friend had run over? 

It doesn’t actually matter if it was voluntary or not, that’s a separate crime and problem, if now having those memories make me guilty, then anyone else having them is also guilty, and not having them makes me innocent. 

So deleting my memories of a crime makes me innocent. 

This is a good way to tie your brain up into knots, and as I mentioned before I’ve got no answers. 

This is stuff to think about. 

Because it extends beyond that. 

Making yourself smarter for instance is very like mind uploading or replacing bit of mind with computer parts too. 

It could be done gradually or instantly, but you can make a very good case it’s not you anymore. 

And a very good one too because suddenly jumping someone’s IQ up a few orders of magnitude is probably going to seriously change their personality. 

Arguing if a duplicate of you down to the last memory is you is maybe somewhat semantic. 

Ditto pulling out some memories or adding others in, the former shouldn’t result in any change of behavior except gradual between you and that clone as you develop different new experiences. 

But usually when we talk about extending life in a transhumanism sense we’re talking about changing their mind too. 

You can make a pretty good case massively upgrading your mind or merging it partially with others is creating a new person and arguably killing the old one. 

Some might view it, especially major changes, as tantamount to suicide. 

Others might argue that it’s no different than a metamorphisis from child to adult. 

Jessica isn’t the same person she was when she was a little girl, anymore than that clone she made of herself ten years ago, complete with memories, is the same person now as she is now. 

Yet there was no death there, and Jessica in the year one million AD, as some giant planet sized computer orbiting with a few million other megaminds around Alpha Centuari as a form of Matrioshka Brain, is probably not the same person anymore. 

Of course if things like identity and consciousness and free will genuinely are illusions, things we trick ourselves into believing to maintain sanity, I sometimes wonder if there is a maximum amount of intelligence something can have before it can’t trick itself anymore into believing in them and just shuts off, not even regarding it as a suicide. 

It doesn’t help to add to that problem that a mind that big and potent, like we discussed in the episode on Matrioshka Brains, has no problem simulating quadrillions of human minds simultaneously and could run through all their lifetimes, again simultaneously, in one second. 

If we can imagine ourselves getting bored after a few thousand years of life, to the point that death is just fine, imagine what that would be like for something like that. 

And your brain can’t store endless memories, but it probably can be modified to store millions of years’ worth without a problem, probably a lot more. 

You might need to archive a lot of them or zip them down to take less memory up, but that itself shouldn’t be an issue. 

In fact it ought to be so little of an issue that if we do figure out how to reasonably seamlessly integrate memories from other people into ourselves too, and run our selves at higher subjective experiences of time, overclocking our brain as it were, you’d expect there to be a huge market for experiences. 

I mean we could probably build a simulation, a virtual reality, of being the first person to step foot on the moon but is that actually the same as feeling the dread of being a quarter million miles from home in a thin tin can or the sheer exhilaration and awe of being the first person to leave your footprint there, of remembering the feel of lunar regolith under your feet? 

So it isn’t hard at all to think folks might buy up all the memories they can from other people. 

We’ve never really talked about currency before in a futuristic context, we probably will do a video on crypto currency pretty soon here, but we tend to figure the main commodities are energy or mass or processing power, but memories might easily be in there too. 

And if you’ve got the capacity for it you might cram an awful lot of them in there, and people being people memories of crimes might be a big commodity too, openly or on a black market. 

Which raises the issue again if the memory of an event, like a crime, makes you guilty of it, or a victim of it if you remember the other side of it. 

And Identity could get real blurry if a billion people remember winning the Olympics, if me uploading my mind to an android makes that android me, it’s kinda hard to claim that me downloading the memories of someone who won the Olympics doesn’t make me that person too. 

That also means that to save space a shared memory might be stored in just one place, or a few for redundancy, and folks might end up with some equivalent to cloud memory storage. 

All of which leads to the idea that civilizations where the people live a really long time and can move memory around and store lots of it might get incredibly touchy about the notion of identity theft, particularly in this especially literal way. 

I could well imagine it being taboo or a crime to voluntarily transfer memories or mix memories or delete memories or run multiple copies of yourself. 

One person, one lifetime, one unique set of memories, even if that lifetime was essentially indefinite. 

They could get a lot more touchy about that too, once on the pathway where uniqueness is important and violating it gets seen as the worst sort of crime. 

Not just, ‘you made a copy of me, you took my memories for your own’ but ‘you are impersonating me’. 

There is after all only so much true uniqueness, same as me tweaking a few things about you doesn’t change who you are, since that is constantly happening and so your identity is a wide spectrum. 

If I took a book by Alistair Reynolds, say House of Suns, one of my favorites that plays with mass cloning, long lifetimes, and identity, if I took that book and changed just a few words, that is still plagiarism. 

Hands down. 

On the same idea, if I dye my hair blond like it was when I was a kid, I’m still me, and if I’d chosen to reference Peter Hamilton, who also incorporates these kind of themes in his work, instead of Alistair Reynolds, this is still the same video. 

So identity isn’t some discrete state with clearly defined borders and there could actually be a limited number of them available. 

There are infinite shades of gray for instance, or may as well be, and the line between it and white and black is hazily defined, but there are only so many genuinely, substantively unique ones. 

And a civilization may decide that is, say, one quadrillion. 

There are only about a quadrillion reasonably unique personalities. 

Try to make a new one and someone says ‘that is identity theft, I want her deleted, she’s impersonating me’ and they might actually do that, after all nothing is being lost, there’s no new person in their eyes who is being killed. 

I think that’s pretty dark but I could envision how something like that could happen, because I can see myself being angry, and we can all see ourselves being angry, at someone who tries to mimic us when it goes beyond a bit of flattery. 

In such a situation killing that copy might be seen as self-defense of your own identity, the only thing that probably matters to a transhuman society where if someone lops of your head they can just dump you in a new body and might just send the culprit a bill for that and fine for inconvenience and trauma. 

So I mentioned a new Fermi Paradox solution, and it ties to that. 

I get asked sometimes if after the Dyson Dilemma, which as I’ve mentioned isn’t a Fermi Paradox Solution, it’s just a challenge to many of them that points toward one solution being more likely, if I’d come up with any solutions that still fit the criteria imposed by the Dyson Dilemma. 

Specifically the notion of eternal expansion of a civilization till it runs out of new and uninhabited places to be. 

That’s essentially it, I can imagine that a civilization might permit only one of everyone inside itself, and that would impose a maximum population on them. 

I can also imagine them aggressively enforcing that. 

With the Fermi Paradox as I’ve mentioned before, it doesn’t matter if a civilization feels it has enough people if there are some dissenters, since unless they are willing to kill anyone trying to leave to setup shop elsewhere some will do that. 

If you’ve come to determine there are essentially only so many unique identities and that it takes less than a Dyson Sphere to support all of them, and if you’ve come to view copying or impersonating that identity as the worst of crimes, yes you would send missiles and warships after anyone trying to flee your empire to setup their own new place with new people. 

Because you would view those people as the worst sort of criminals. 

But this only works as a solution if they come to see identity with that degree of passion, and if that’s an inevitable thing virtually all civilizations go for. 

I don’t think that’s likely, I certainly hope it isn’t because it’s kinda dark, but I could see it happening. 

It would also only work if the number of unique identities was less than one solar system or a handful could handle, though considering how many human-level intelligences we calculated you could cram into a Matrioshka Brain that’s not much of cap. 

And irritatingly it fits in rather nicely with the Doomsday Argument, since you then have a set and finite number of people. 

If there’s a maximum of, say, a trillion identities, us being among the first hundred billion of them is not particularly improbable. 

If those folks are immortal the count ends but it arguably doesn’t matter if they don’t since if Bob, with his specific set of twenty key personality traits, does die and they replace him with someone of those same traits, it’s kind of debatable if they actually replaced him or just resurrected him and the count remains the same. 

And we can play a similar matching game with the Simulation Hypothesis obviously, though we’ll stop here for today. 

I don’t care for this solution as I mentioned, but of all the ones I’ve tried to slap together after coming up with the Dyson Dilemma it is the only one that I feel has sufficient consistency to earn a place as one. 

We’ll call it the Uniqueness Solution, though I’m tempted to call it the Uniqueness Holocaust solution but I suppose I’m obliged to try be neutral and open-minded even to my theories. 

Summary version, we still don’t understand identity and consciousness yet, maybe we never will, and it doesn’t permit us to speak with much certainty about things in the future that revolve around that. 

Hopefully you’ve come away from this episode with some more questions about this key topic of philosophy and science. 

Incidentally in regard to last week’s video on Tabby’s Star, there was a new paper on the long-term dimming that came out right as the video did, and I ended up directing to folks to Centuari Dreams to get Paul Gilster’s take on it. 

There’s probably going to be a lot of developments on that matter and he’s excellent place to go to stay up to date on those, and you can subscribe to his site to get emails of the material as it comes in. 

Centuari Dreams is one of my own favorite sites and he’s very good about presenting the material in-depth without dumbing it down while still making it very easy to read. 

So check him out if you want updates about that crazy star. 

So channel updates. 

First the website is up, and that is Isaac Arthur.net, doubtless it will be tweaked or added to as time goes by but I’m very happy with it and very grateful to Luis, the gentleman who volunteered an awful lot of his time to making it happen. 

With it in place we’ll move on with some other expansions like getting the channel its own Facebook page, and I did open a twitter account for the channel, which was my first time using that, and I’ll look at some other options like reddit. 

Starting last week I uploaded the episode narrations to Soundcloud, and everything is up there now with each series having a new audio-only introduction, some of which amount to short episodes. 

I’m still surprised folks wanted an audio only version but it available. 

Speaking of that, you may have noticed this video I didn’t remind people to turn on the subtitles or how they can click on video links, it’s not compatible to those audio only versions, and I think quick pop up on the video will do. 

I might mention it out loud in gateway video I think will have a lot of new audience members, but mentioning it almost every time is getting on my own nerves and I think a lot of the audience too. 

Of course the subtitles will stay as will the video links, and I’m looking at putting them up in other languages. 

A Professor was kind enough to hand translate one of the videos into French and I still haven’t figured out how to get the timing on that to upload it, and he’d suggested I might do that for all the videos and in as many languages as possible. 

I love the idea, more than half my audience is not from the US, where I make my home, and most of them aren’t from English-first countries, so having translation available as subtitles, even if I have to resort to dubiously done auto-translations, is very tempting if I can figure out how to do it in some sort of reasonably quick method. 

If anyone happens to know of any, let me know. 

I’m also adding Frequently Asked Questions to each video on the website, those will emerge as time permits, some are already done, others it might be a week or two. 

Also on the webpage is a donations page link. 

That will take you to the options of Patreon for continual donations, but also now Paypal for one time donations and Bitcoin for those prefer that. 

Next week’s episode will be a look at Dark Matter, as we prepare to do some cosmology discussion to clear up confusion folks often have about the size of the Universe, Dark Energy, Dark Flow, Galactic Superclusters and Walls, and Voids. 

I’d thought about covering both Dark Matter and Energy at the same time but they truly are different topics and I’ve been letting the videos get too long again, I can’t realistically keep to the half hour plus video a week I’ve been doing of late and need to start breaking things into smaller bits. 

As always questions and comments are welcome. 

Subscribe to the channel if you want alerts when that and other videos come out, and if you enjoyed this episode, share it with others, and try out some of the other series and episodes on this channel. 

Thanks for joining me today for this look at consciousness and Identity and we’ll see you next time!

Welcome! Тhis channel focuses on in-depth looks at science and futurism. 

We explore concepts like the Fermi paradox, exoplanets, terraforming alien planets or blowing them up. 

Giant megastructures too big to even fit on a planet and ideas like mind uploading and simulated realities or living around black holes in the distant future, interstellar colonization, arcologies and planet wide cities. Alien civilizations and artificial planets are just some of the many topics we look at here. 

So if those sound interesting to you subscribe now, grab a drink and a snack and pick a video to start with.

Tabby's Star

2016-08-04  
https://youtu.be/SVCpBr3fxdE  

---

So today we’ll be taking our first look at Astronomical techniques and SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and I thought we’d kick that off by looking at KIC 8462852, also known as Tabby’s Star. 

This star was one of many observed continuously for years by the Kepler Space Observatory and it was noticed in late 2015 that there was some very peculiar dips in its brightness that do not match up to phenomena we’ve previously observed. 

Now while it is almost certainly a natural phenomena, we never like to rule out the idea that strange things might be the results of either errors or artificial tinkering, so it’s been suggested it could be a megastructure, a type of very large artificial construct, presumably of alien origin. 

Now if you happen to already be familiar with this channel it will come as no surprise I get asked about Tabby’s Star a lot. 

Two of the biggest subjects covered on this channel are megastructures and the Fermi Paradox, the question of where all the aliens are. 

If you’re not familiar with these topics you can click either of the links on the screen right now to pause this video and watch those in new windows. 

You should also turn on the closed caption subtitles if you’re not used to my voice yet. 

So I get asked about this star a lot and have since it came out. 

I avoided doing a video on it because I didn’t think it likely to be a megastructure… and I still do not… and in astronomy and physics it isn’t unusual to encounter strange mysteries that defy obvious explanations and have to wait years for the evidence to become available. 

It’s a bit tedious and frustrating but you get used to it. 

I changed my mind both because I have been getting asked about it a lot more recently and because we do have more information now, but also because I don’t think anyone’s done a nice simple down to Earth explanation of the situation. 

Stuff gets skipped for brevity that I think is important to a basic understanding of this phenomena. 

We don’t do brevity on this channel, and while we do aim for simplicity we do that not by skipping the hard stuff but by patiently dissecting it into nice mouth-sized chewable bits for easy digestion. 

We’ll do that by dividing it into topics for today and future videos, and here are out topics for today, our questions we want to answer: 1) What is the Kepler Space Observatory? 

2) How did Kepler help us find Exoplanets? 

3) What was the anomaly it found at Tabby’s Star 4) What does this information tell us? 

5) What natural phenomena might explain this? 

6) What new Info and developments have occurred? 

7) What sort of Megastructure could it be? 

Now as mentioned we’ve covered both the Fermi Paradox and Megastructures in detail elsewhere, so we’ll be skimming a lot of that, this video will already be long enough you probably want to settle in with a cup of coffee and snack; so if we covered those in detail again it would just be longer and we’ve already spent several hours on each of those topics. 

Our first Topic is the Kepler Space Observatory, this was launched in 2009 into orbit around the sun. 

It doesn’t orbit Earth but rather was launched into orbit around the sun, initially trailing behind Earth and a bit further out and is now over a hundred million miles away from us. 

It got further behind us in our orbit because it is a bit further from the sun then us, and the further you are away from a star the long an orbit takes, same as being closer to a star, or being around a more massive star, makes those orbits go faster. 

Which is pretty important to exoplanet hunting, but for the moment means Kepler is a long way behind us. 

Now what this observatory observes is pretty straight-forward. 

It is a photometer, which means it measure brightness. 

In this case Kepler constantly measures the brightness of roughly 150,000 stars. 

Which sounds like a lot but it actually is looking at the same patch of the sky and it’s a very small patch, about a quarter of a percent of the night sky. 

That chunk incidentally is in between Vega and Deneb. 

You probably know Deneb as the star that makes up the tail of Cygnus the Swan, and Vega is in the constellation Lyra, both of which are fairly close to the big and little dipper’s and North Star Polaris. 

In fact Vega was the North Star our ancestor used when the Ice age was ending and will be again in a little over ten thousand years. 

Earth has a 26,000 year planetary precession and at the moment that makes Polaris the North Star, Vega will get its turn again, and it’s also where terms like the Age of Aquarius come from, since the Sun appears in the spring Equinox of the Northern hemisphere in one of the zodiac constellations and that changes every couple thousand years and right now it’s Aquarius. 

So Kepler tilts its eyes up and looks at that patch of the sky year round, and it just watches for any increase or decrease in brightness of those stars in that patch, which is again about 150,000. 

Many of these stars have other names or catalogues numbers too but they exist in the Kepler Input Catalogue, or KIC. 

Kepler wasn’t looking for new stars it was observing known ones but not many stars actually have names since there are so many of them so it isn’t unusual for one to have multiple catalogue entries and just get referred to by whichever one was used when the interesting thing about it was found, then it usually gets a name to save time and confusion. 

There’s a lot of exoplanets and a lot of them have names beginning with Kepler or Gliese and then a number and that name just tells you the catalog, the Gliese catalog for instance is a catalog of nearby stars originally published in 1957 by German Astronomer Wilhelm Gliese and it’s been kept up and unsurprisingly a lot of those stars had no other name yet and were also the easiest to look for planets around. 

Those will obviously need renaming if we ever colonize them since a large number of our nearby stars are named Gliese something-or-other and no colony is going to keep that name in abridged form since it would be like naming your island Atlas or Rand-Mcnally. 

And there’s a handful of these catalogs that almost all exoplanets are catalogued in. 

Which takes us to topic 2, hunting for Exoplanets. 

Stars dim for many reasons, ours fluctuates in brightness and they all do, but a common cause is from an object getting in the way. 

And a pretty big object to cause a star to noticeably dim. 

Or a pretty close object. 

Mercury blocks a lot more light than Mars does for instance, even though it’s a bit smaller. 

Now to detect a planet this way you need three things. 

First you need for its orbital plane to be tilted toward us, you wouldn’t see Mercury or Earth blocking sunlight if you were hanging over the Sun’s pole. 

So we can’t see an exoplanet around a star that’s orbital plane is cocked away from us and that’s most of them. 

People tend to think solar systems line up with the galactic plane but they mostly don’t, our own is tilted about 60 degrees off it. 

Second you need there to be a planet there that’s big enough or close enough to its sun to block enough light for us to notice it, that’s why virtually all the original exoplanets were huge things of a size with Jupiter and close to their Sun, Hot Jupiters are just easiest to see The bigger it is, the more light it blocks, but the closer it is the more light it blocks and the more likely it is to be in between us and that star. 

A tiny little planet like Pluto far away from its sun is very unlikely to line up with its star and an observer and is so small and far away it blocks virtually no light. 

It’s also takes a long time to orbit, which is the third thing. 

You need to stare at these stars for a long time to not only see a dimming but also a repeat of that dimming. 

Earth would block light to an observer once a year, Pluto would do it every couple of centuries, and until you’ve seen this periodic dimming at least a couple times you can’t do much else. 

Once you’ve observed it at least twice, preferably thrice, you can take that period and say there’s a planet there and it has a an orbital period of so many days and from that, combined with the star’s mass, calculate how far away it is from its own sun. 

You can then take that star’s brightness and determine if that planet might be close enough to have liquid water on it instead of ice but far enough not to be boiling. 

What we call the Habitable zone. 

If Earth were around a much more massive star, but at the same distance, our year would be shorter, we’d also burn to death because more massive stars are a lot brighter, a star twice as massive as our own isn’t twice as bright, it’s more like ten times as bright. 

We also wouldn’t be around such a star anyway since a star twice as massive as our own would only live a little over a billion years, our sun is 4.6 billion years old, and the sun was a good 4 billions years old when the first animals started emerging, and not complex ones either, the sea sponge is usually considered to be the first animal. 

So we don’t just look for planets around distant suns, we have after all found thousands of them in the last decade, we look for planets in the Habitbale Zone of each system and Kepler’s method, which is just one of the exoplanet hunting methods, is a pretty good one for those hunts. 

If for instance we detected a drop of a less than percent in a star’s brightness for a day or so once every 750 day’s around a star about half again our sun’s mass and about 5 times brighter we’d know there was a reasonably Earth-sized planet hanging out about 1.8 Astronomical Units, AU, 1.8 times further from its sun that Earth was, and that the planet in question would get about half-again as much light as we do, in terms of sunlight per unit area… meaning it would be pretty hot but maybe habitable. 

We wouldn’t much care about one blocking more than a percent of that light because it would be too big to be a potentially habitable planet and one blocking a lot more than a percent would presumably be huge. 

Indeed way too huge for even a gas giant if it were orbiting that far out, and when you’re collecting data from 150,000 stars each day for years at a time you’re not looking at that raw data you have a computer shuffling it for the stuff you want. 

So that takes us to Topic 3, the anomaly around Tabby’s Star. 

Because it is half again our sun’s mass and about 5 times brighter than our sun. 

We’ve detected this anomaly twice, a dip in brightness of 15% the first time and 22% the second time. 

The first was in March 2011 and the second in February of 2013. 

With a spread of about 750 days. 

Kepler was launched in March 2009 so we just missed a chance to see it then, and the observatory was having problem in April 2015 so we missed that chance too. 

We get another in May of 2017. 

But the dip was huge, and not what was being looked for, since it is most definitely not a Earth-sized Habitable Zone Planet. 

With that period it would be closer to Venus than Earth in how much light it gets, and it would be a lot bigger than Jupiter. 

The second bigger dip was also very irregular, dimming then very slightly brightening and dimming way more, something you might expect off a double planet or a coincidental conjunction of two planets at the time it was transiting its star for us. 

So nobody noticed it before the third occasion would have happened and it was actually volunteers, citizen scientists they’ve been getting called, who poured through the data manually in the Planet Hunters Project. 

Citizen scientist is a newer term, I would just call that an amateur astronomer, and astronomy has relied on them for a long time, but regardless I like the initiative to bring more folks into the hunt and crowdsourcing, for both funds and volunteers, is starting to show up as a genuine alternative to either government or big business research especially in things like SETI and astronomy in general and I find this move both fascinating and potentially incredibly useful. 

I’ve some friends who started experimenting with research through crowdsourcing for their Space Ranch Aquaponics project and it seems quite promising. 

It’s something I think we’ll talk about more in the future, both in regard to SETI and some other projects like that. 

Anyway, nobody saw it in time for the third dip in Early 2015 or we could have arranged to look at it without Kepler which again was malfunctioning at the time, but once they did they sent on to the astronomers who went WTF, and nicknamed the Star the WTF star, which officially was short for Where’s the Flux?, in reference to the weird flux in brightness, though I preferred What the Flux personally. 

Eventually instead of calling it by its Kepler Catalogue number or that technically-not-a-curse-word cognomen everyone started calling it for the lead author on the team that wrote it up, Astronomer Tabetha Boyajian, or Tabby’s Star. 

She’s also led the campaign to get funds to observe the star in more detail and in different frequencies then Kepler did. 

But that was the anomaly, and again we just missed seeing it the first time in 2009 right before Kepler went active and missed it in 2015 from technical problems, so we haven’t got much data yet. 

So Topic #4, what does this tell us? 

First as I mentioned a dip of this magnitude at that distance, a bit under twice as far from that Star as Earth is from our sun, means the thing is huge, whatever it is. 

Much bigger than Jupiter. 

Second it’s hotter than Earth since it gets about 50% more sunlight per unit area. 

Now I want to mention that Tabby’s Star is a F3 Star either on the main sequence or the late stage of it as what we call a subgiant. 

It’s decently brighter than a main sequence star of its mass should be. 

Not tons, not like an actual red giant, but the assumption is this is an old star near the end of its life. 

That’s been challenged more recently but we’ll get to that. 

Now old for a star of this mass would mean creeping up on 3 billion years, and again our own sun is 4.6 billion years old. 

Obviously we’ll be talking about the alien artifact option near the end but I want to drive that home now, this thing is around a star that’s maximum lifetime would have caused it to die about the same time multi-cellular life was just coming into existence on Earth, and the thing in question is pretty hot compared to Earth so it’s not a great candidate for life to have originated. 

So Topic #5, what natural phenomena might explain this, and why many of the suggested ones don’t work well. 

It’s too big to be a planet, but an object doesn’t have to be massive to block a lot of light, anymore than your curtains have to be heavier than a bowling ball just because they block more light. 

So the first couple thoughts were a lot of gas and ice, like a comet, comets are very small but very bright after all and thus block a lot light. 

Or alternatively maybe a collision of planets that sprayed debris everywhere. 

Now remember we’ve only seen this twice, so for instance a big comet coming in from deep space could have been spotted as it approached and 750 days later as it left for instance. 

Ditto it could have been a whole wave of comets perturbed in by some large body sweeping around in the outer solar system. 

Tabby’s Star does have a red dwarf star about 800 AU from it, for relative comparison Pluto is about one twentieth that distance at 40 AU, and Alpha Centuari is over 300 times further away at around a quarter of a million AU from us. 

So that’s a very plausible source of the sort of disruption that can cause a big deluge of comets. 

And debris spread outs but stay decently clumped on timelines of a couple of years, again the first dip masked 15% of the star’s brightness and the second time 22%, so an expanding wave of debris would work. 

Like that produced by two planets colliding. 

Such collision ought to be incredibly rare, so that it would be weird to luck out and see one, but we don’t really know how rare and it is the sort of thing you’d loosely guess happened every billion or so years and expect the debris to hang around for decades. 

So watching 150,000 stars and seeing one is improbable but not winning the lottery improbable. 

So of course they looked for evidence of either of those. 

We can’t see the presumed conjunction of it with the star and us till May 2017 but any big debris field ought to be scattering light and it out to be emitting as much light as it absorbed. 

What it scattered and reflected plus what it absorbed would equal what it blocked, and even comets which are quite reflective absorb a lot of light. 

As we’ve talked about a lot on this channel, especially in regard to Dyson Spheres and the concept of a Planet-Wide city, a Ecumenopolis, light absorbed gets emitted as heat. 

In this case as infrared radiation in the general zone of about 10 micron wavelengths, which corresponds to roughly Earth-like temperatures. 

Whatever hits an object in space and doesn’t bounce away will warm that object until it reaches a temperature where it’s radiating away as much as it absorbs, this equilibrium point has a peak frequency associated to it, and distribution of wavelengths around it, that we can look for. 

Needless to say those wavelengths associated to the temperatures liquid water can exist at interest us greatly when looking at places where biological life might exist. 

We’d expect the debris to be glowing with all that light and quite brightly as these things go. 

Indeed a planetary collision would glow a lot hotter too, since there’s a lot of energy converted into heat in that sort of collision, the kind we think made our own moon. 

You also wouldn’t expect an older star to have as many big collisions around it, those get less common as time passes and debris clumps together and either gets into a stable orbit, falls into the sun, or gets ejected from the solar system. 

I’ve heard folks doubt the comet barrage options because of how much would be needed but I’m inclined to reject that, even though it really would need to be a huge amount in this case and I agree it isn’t terribly satisfactory as answer. 

We don’t know how much ice is hanging out in deep space near Earth but Oort Cloud estimates often routinely and largely exceeds Earth’s own mass and an awful lot of that is ice, so it doesn’t seem that strange to me to think this larger star might have even more than us and that having a red dwarf only 800 AU away might cause a massive disruption, heck it could be a small planet passing by dragging a ton of stuff with it while it disintegrates, Pluto and most Icy Dwarfs are essentially over-sized comets. 

But it doesn’t look terribly plausible either. 

A really big asteroid belt could work, asteroids block more light per unit mass than planets do. 

So an Earth’s worth of asteroid’s in terms of mass would block a lot more light than us. 

But you’d kinda expect something like that to be decently symmetric, a ring, not a blob, and a ring doesn’t have an orbital period making it block light every couple years for a couple days, it’s always blocking light at that angle. 

But you could have a partial ring, a bit of swarm of asteroids that moved in a pack, we see that with Trojan asteroid Fields for instance and for that matter a big planet like Jupiter could have a really huge swarm of junk around it, sort of like Saturn Rings, and it could be tilted like Uranus is so rings were perpendicular to the ecliptic and blocked a lot light. 

So what’s left? 

Well a planet forming would work, a protoplanet. 

It’s not an ideal solution either particularly since the star would have to presumably be a lot younger than it appears on initial inspection, but dating stars is harder than it sounds like and we often do it by looking at the stars nearby it that it’s moving with. 

That’s not always the same thing by the way, stars often form from the same nebula and stick together in their movement through the galaxy but many spin off and packs of stars often plow through other packs of stars. 

Some of the stars in our night sky have been with us since the sun was born and others are just briefly passing by. 

When we can see many moving more or less together it makes narrowing down their age a lot easier. 

But moving into newer developments, topic 6. 

We’re not sure how old this star is, but if it is younger than we think a protoplanet might work. 

Now you can have planets form in star systems that aren’t new, after all if two ram together and explode you’d expect some of that to coalesce back into a new planet eventually, so we could have a clumping debris field that already cooled in an older star system too, but neither of these feels too plausible either. 

We’ve also been looking at old photographic plates of the star, again the catalogue name or calling it the WTF Star or tabby’s Star are all very new, this thing was found over a century ago and well catalogued in different catalogs long before Kepler was launched. 

They’ve dug up over a thousand old shots of that chunk of the night sky where this star is visible and we can compare it brightness in those to the stars nearby it. 

Those indicate that since 1890 the star has faded by as much as 20%, though that has a lot of room for error. 

So again what’s left? 

Probably a lot of things. 

It might be one of these, it might be something new. 

We’ll find out more between now and May 2017 when the event should occur again, and that will tell us a lot more too. 

We’ve been looking at it a lot with other tools and again there is crowdsourcing to help get the funds for more tools. 

As this video comes out in August of 2016, we’ve got about 9 months to go before we’ll get a lot more information and hopefully find out WTF. 

One of the other developments was SETI looking at it, and they didn’t find anything. 

I don’t think they expected to but they had to try, no signals, but negative evidence is still useful to us. 

Now folks often suggest aliens might use entirely encrypted signals, or not use radio at all or use lasers instead of omni-directional signaling, we talked about that in the Fermi Paradox Compendium, but the encrypted idea doesn’t work too well for the same reason I don’t need to break an encrypted code to know someone is sending messages. 

Particularly since if this is an artificial structure it’s as subtle and covert as an elephant blundering through a downtown metropolis. 

Encryption always has a cost so you wouldn’t encrypt everything unless you had a reason to, and if that reason was trying to hide your civilization building a giant structure around a star that noticeably eclipses it isn’t the best way to doing that. 

It would be like a sniper or recon force sneaking around the jungle in camouflage but stopping every few minutes to fire flares guns and sing their national anthem through megaphones. 

Last Topic. 

If this were a megastructure what kind would it be? 

Well it’s not a dyson sphere, if you’re a veteran of this channel and the megastructures series you obviously already know that. 

Now a Dyson Sphere doesn’t need to be a rigid shell around a star, it actually shouldn’t be and originally wasn’t meant to be when Freeman Dyson came up with the idea, but we’ve talked about that before. 

It could be an early stage Dyson Swarm that’s maybe 1% complete. 

But that ought to be symmetric. 

You might build a dyson swarm in stages but you’d probably do it by making rings of swarm objects and adding to each ring then adding a new ring. 

It’s easier to do it that way since those swarm objects have virtually no escape velocity and so you’d need almost no thrust to move from one place on the ring to a neighbor. 

Moving on the same ring of orbitals in a dyson swarm could be accomplished with a space suit and fire extinguisher. 

Now that said, every dyson sphere begins somewhere and if we were building one in our solar system it might start off as what I call a Planet Cloud, something we discussed a bit more in the Ecumenpolis video a few weeks back. 

In that sort of case you’d expect the home planet to basically develop a cloud of orbital habitats and solar collectors like a mini dyson swarm itself, a big bubble, and to see rings stretching out from that initially. 

And that would look a lot like what we’re seeing with Tabby’s Star So I don’t think this is what is going on at Tabby’s Star but if it is a megastructure that’s what I’m putting my money on. 

Ditto you could mine a planet in a similar fashion, you’d expect to see a big swarm of orbital and megastrucutres near a planet you were strip mining and a lot of debris too, micrometeors aren’t as big a deal when you don’t have to spend thousands of dollars a pound for your space stations because you can armor them up and surround them with ice and rock, as we discussed in the Rotating Habitats video. 

Considering the star appears to have dimmed in the century we’ve been observing it too, you could have a fairly symmetric distribution overall except where some planets are that are being stripped for additional construction material. 

But here’s the big problem… there’s no reason to do this around this star. 

We’re not seeing indicators of some sprawling interstellar empire in this region, and again Kepler was staring at that patch of sky, a lot of those stars were nearer or farther but it’s neighbors were all in that sample. 

It stretches credulity that any intelligent life evolved around a star whose maximum lifetime is about 3 billion years, and again while it’s probably pretty near the end of that, it might be younger too, which would make that even more unlikely. 

So this isn’t someone’s home solar system, and there’s no sprawling empire there with other stars exhibiting the same effects. 

This gets us into motives. 

Why would you pick a short-lived star, one probably on the old side, as your one place to start setting up megastructures? 

You might mine inferior veins of ore or farm not-so-fertile land but not until you’d already gone for the low hanging fruit and there are tons of stars near that thing that are better candidates. 

Now maybe they just got there a century or so ago, relatively speaking, its 1500 light years away so what we’re seeing now, in terms of it dimming in the last century and our current observations, all took place when the Roman Empire was falling. 

Maybe their home system is nearby and it’s not cocked our direction and isn’t a full dyson swarm yet, maybe they just started grabbing every system near them and we’re only picking up this one as one of the earliest and titled at the right angle. 

But it does seem a stretch to think that this is either A) Someone’s home solar system and they evolved very fast compared to us, B) The sole place they’ve decided to do this, or C) One of the first they did and the only one we can see so far. 

Mostly because even with C it’s incredibly improbable a civilization could be setting up interstellar empires in full-blown Kardashev 2 style and be this close to us in space and also coincidentally this close to us in time, just starting, while no others are further along a bit further away. 

After all if one civilization developed 1500 light years from us, then if we drew a bubble of space 3000 light years out, with double the radius and therefore 8 times the volume and 8 times the stars, you’d expect 8 more planets to have birthed technological civilization on average. 

And 1500 years in nothing on galactic timelines so it would be really strange for one of those eight not to have a much longer headstart, especially since this solar system, if it was their home system, would imply 3 billions years is enough to become technological compared to our own 4.6 billion years. 

We talked about this general concept more in the Dyson Dilemma, and the Fermi Paradox Compendium, so you might want to watch those to get a better idea of how ridiculously this would stretch the odds on plausibility if that’s not settling home just yet. 

It would be like getting struck by lightning and winning the lottery on the same afternoon. 

So in summary, I don’t see much odds for this being a megastructure, not just because it could be and probably is a natural phenomena but because it just doesn’t fit the bill. 

Okay, that will finish us up for the day. 

Some quick channel notes: The website should be up in a bit over week and we’ll talk about that more next time, but what we have this week is the launch of the Soundcloud version of the channel, that came out earlier this week and I’ve been uploading more content throughout the week. 

It will still be a bit before it’s all up there, but all the playlist will be up as albums when this video comes out. 

Except for megastructures which was my test, those each include an introductory segment to each playlist with some new material exclusively available in audio. 

Soundcloud is free to listen to, and I have enabled the download function so you don’t need to be online to listen to them. 

In any event that’s up now, and there is some new content just for that format and I might do some more that way since audio only is a lot easier to do than videos, and I never run out of topics. 

Speaking of that, next week’s topic will take us back to the Existential Crisis Series for a look at Consciousness and Identity, and we’re going to examine some of the concepts like cloning, including duplication of the mind, hive minds, and distributed consciousness. 

Lots of familiar concepts from science fiction in there and a lot very strange ones, along with some disturbing implications. 

Last note, the plan is still in place to do about one video a month selected by an audience member picked by raffle from the channels patrons. 

The intent is to do that via Patreon, but I’m having the darnedest time thinking of a quick, fair, and easy method. 

I’ve noticed there are some online raffle sites that let you do something along those lines but I haven’t really had the time to investigate, and I feel like I’ve put that on hold too long. 

So if any of you have any ideas what would be best head down to the comments section and I’ll open a thread to brainstorm about it. 

Youtube doesn’t have a ‘pinned post’ option so if you’re having trouble finding it re-sort by ‘top comments’ and hit the like button on that thread too to keep it at the top. 

Don’t forget to like this video too if you enjoyed it, and share it with others. 

Until next week, thanks for watching, and have a great day!

FTL04: Wormholes
---
  
2016-07-29  
https://youtu.be/LNwhe_ztaGw  

---

So today’s topic is wormholes, and we will be trying to clear away some of the confusion about this idea today and hopefully avoid adding any more confusion to the mix. 

This will not be easy since we can’t discuss general relativity in too much detail. 

As I mentioned back in episode one of this series you need an awful lot of math to actually see the genuine explanation for how these things work, the non-math explanations and analogies you probably already know. 

If you do have that math background I recommended Leonard Susskind’s series on general relativity at the start of the Faster Than Light series and I’ll recommend it again now. 

Like any of the video links you’ll see today you can just click on that to pause this video and watch that and come back here and un-pause this one when you’re done but in this case, since that series is several hours long, I would suggest finishing this one first. 

Since we can’t do the math I’m just going to talk about the types of wormholes, of which again there are a lot, and the various categories of them, and some lesser known neat things about them. 

Categorization tends to be arbitrary but here is our list of topics for today: 1) Basic Concept of Wormholes 2) Non-Traversable Wormholes 3) Traversable Wormholes 4) One-Way Wormholes 5) Two-Way Wormholes 6) Intra-Universe Wormholes 7) Inter-Universe Wormholes 8) Exotic Matter and Wormholes 9) The Casimir Effect 10) Naked Singularities 11) Quantum Entanglement and Wormholes 12) Travel Time in Wormholes 13) Time Travel using Wormholes 14) Other Uses of Wormholes Everybody knows what a wormhole is, in terms of basic function, it’s a gateway from one place to another. 

We often represent this in science fiction as a circular mouthed tunnel that after some time gets you to your destination at the other end of the tunnel. 

Incidentally we usually would refer to these as the mouths and throat. 

Some wormholes are one way, in which case only one would technically be a mouth but obviously we are not going to label the other mouth for a one-way wormhole with the anatomically correct term for that digestive analogy. 

Now we can’t go into the math of wormholes but I can answer some of misconceptions and questions that often come from those who don’t know the math. 

For instance, we usually represent wormholes as 2D gates, or mouths, in science fiction but a naturally occurring one ought to be a sphere, but it doesn’t actually have to be one and a lot of models for making these things artificially with exotic matter favor the more 2D version as being way cheaper on exotic matter. 

We’ve discussed exotic matter before in this series and we’ll review it later on, but it’s generally required in most wormhole theories to permit you to use them for travel. 

Similarly when we show models of these things where it shows two flat grid planes connected together by a tunnel, the throat, it makes people wonder if you could exit midway through, but you can’t because there is nothing to exit through. 

It’s easier to visualize I think as a balloon where you’ve poked it with a finger in two separate place and kept pushing till your fingers met. 

Only that’s still basically 2D and you can imagine sneaking outside the rubber, same as you picture the entrances to each end of the tunnel as 2D. 

There’s nothing to sneak outside to though. 

These aren’t subways tunnels or elevators cutting through space time where you watch them whiz by faster than light on some straight line between the two mouths. 

The throat of a typical spherical wormhole in a black hole example is actually a sphere of space inside the event horizon. 

So a wormhole does actually take time to traverse. 

They’re not instant and we’ll look at that more later. 

Sometimes conceptually it is easier to think of the black hole variety as more like the layers of our planet, crust, mantle, and inner and outer core. 

The crust being the event horizon, and the mantle a vortex like region the way down, the throat would then be the outer core and the ‘narrowest part’ would be the shell at the edge of the inner and outer core, your ship can’t be bigger than that. 

And not all wormholes have to have a single tunnel either, some versions allow multiple exits and for that matter one of the newer theories regarding hawking radiation is that it gets out by lots of individual wormholes. 

Later on we’ll look at a new theory of growing popularity that contemplates the idea that particles that are entangled with each other might be connected by tiny wormholes. 

Wormholes also don’t have to be the same size, no more than the mouths of a classic tunnel have to be. 

But you can only send something through that’s smaller than throat, or it will be ripped apart, same as a train slamming through a tunnel that suddenly narrows, it’s just more 3-Dimensional rather than the long chain a train can be since only its cross-section matters for passage. 

You also can’t stick anything through a wormhole that is as massive, or more massive, than it is or you’re going to destabilize it. 

Destabilize in this context would usually mean releasing the majority of the wormhole’s mass outward while a smaller portion collapses inward… which is essentially a supernova. 

Obviously if the wormhole weren’t very massive this wouldn’t be as bad but unless we were talking about some of the ultra-tiny kinds of wormholes you might use for just sending signals or tiny fast streams of matter you wouldn’t want to be in the same solar system when one exploded… … you wouldn’t want to be near the smaller one either but at least there we’re talking booms of the non-planet destroying variety. 

Now there’s tons of types of hypothetical wormholes and quite a few of the naturally occurring versions are ridiculously tiny and hanging out in the quantum foam, often the idea is to take one of those and expand it, or that they might have naturally expanded as the Universe expanded. 

We’ll talk about that a bit more when we get to the Casimir Effect later on. 

Before we move into our second topic though, let me just make one point. 

Wormholes are incredibly theoretical, and there are tons of different models. 

So a lot of times you’ll get stuff about their behavior that sounds very contradictory and that’s because it usually is. 

Each model is different. 

We’ll be sticking to the ones that decently follow from general relativity today. 

You can go nuts trying to keep them all separate and unfortunately a lot of folks I know with intermediate knowledge on this tend to make the mistake of locking down on just one version and tend to be guilty of saying “No that’s not how it works.” When there’s actually plenty of models where that is how it works. 

Okay so topic 2. 

Non-Traversable Wormholes. 

This is pretty straightforward conceptually, it’s a type of wormhole you can’t pass through, either because the throat collapses before you get through or from a more practical standpoint one that would just kill you trying to make the passage. 

This arguably includes any wormhole with an event horizon and basically any black hole. 

The original wormhole concept, a Schwarzschild wormhole or Einstein-Rosen Bridge is one of these and trying to find a wormhole that isn’t is obviously the goal. 

Einstein and Rosen were trying to avoid a mathematical singularity, essentially of a dot like point of infinite density at the center of a black hole, which these days with better computing power we generally think is partially wrong anyway, with concepts like Singularity Vortex Sheets, and nobody took the solutions that spawned the notion in the mid-1930s too serious until John Wheeler screwed around with it in the Early 60’s and pointed out such a wormhole would collapse almost instantly. 

I should probably remind everyone at this point when we talk about the interiors of black hole and use comments like ‘very quick’ or ‘almost instantly’ that time runs at an absurdly slow rate inside a black hole. 

Time doesn’t stop when you fall into a black hole, not past the event horizon anyway, it just keeps getting slower and slower as you go deeper down. 

For you, assuming you were falling into one of the really big ones at the center of many galaxies that don’t have tidal forces so strong they’d shred every atom of your body before you got inside, you’d fall just like normal from your perspective, it would be very fast since you’re accelerating fast but to an outsider, who can’t actually see you anymore, but magically could for our analogy, your trip would seem to take longer and longer as you fell. 

So a fast event inside a black hole might only take a second of internal time but take eons externally. 

But in a nutshell a non-traversable wormhole is just that, one you can’t traverse. 

You can take that very narrowly to mean just those for which nothing can get through, even a photon or particle, or more widely to mean one where it would just kill you trying, even if your particles exited the other side. 

Traversable Wormholes, topic 3, are the ones you can pass through. 

Most versions of this involve using exotic matter to keep the throat open so it doesn’t destabilize and again we’ll look at that more later. 

It is usually considered to be a lot of exotic matter though, the Morris Thorne Wormhole called for about 100 million suns worth of this stuff we’ve never found a single particle of while the Visser Wormhole only requires a modest Jupiter-sized amount of it. 

Incidentally you will sometimes now hear the Morris-Thorne Wormhole called an Ellis Wormhole, or Ellis drainhole, since more recently it got noticed H.G. Ellis and K.A. 

Bronnikov had both independently figured out the concept in 1973, it’s the same thing in this case so Ellis gets the credit for first figuring it out. 

So Kip Thorne loses the credit for discovering it first but still gets the true accolades because he got the notion of traversable wormholes back into circulation in the late 80s and shortly after that a lot of other versions were uncovered from the renewed interest. 

I’d give a similar credit to Matt Visser though, as one of those early enthusiast after interest got renewed. 

Thorne and Visser opened the door that made it both an interesting and respectable field of speculation and simultaneously opened the door for an awful lot of wonderful science fiction, including two of my favorites, the Stargate Franchise and Star Trek Deep Space Nine. 

I know some folks like to argue the Kirk vs Picard issue of who was the better captain but for me it always goes to Avery Brooks’s portrayal of Benjamin Sisko, especially after they let him shave his head and grow a goatee. 

So with the door open we got a lot of versions of wormholes that might work in this or that cosmological model including some that didn’t require much or any mass at all, exotic or mundane. 

Of course those also broke down into one-way versus two way wormholes, and raised the question whether they exited into our universe or a different one. 

Topics 4 and 5 are pretty straight-forward then. 

Some wormholes are one way streets, so if you wanted to go back you’d need a separate wormhole nearby the first one’s mouths. 

Stargate went this route though they let you shut it off and dial back to the original place, or any other destination in the catalog you had an address for. 

They also let you send signals both ways and I never understood the justification for that, beyond the importance of it for plots needing conversation through the thing by radio. 

The original basis for that is probably the idea of black holes connecting to white holes. 

A white hole is the exact opposite of a black hole in that you can’t push anything inside, whereas in a black hole you can’t push anything outside. 

The original concept for this out of the Einstein Field Equations was that a black hole was a future state and a white hole emerged from that same black hole in the past, this is just one of the many time travel things that comes up with wormholes as a concept which we’ll discuss later on too. 

Those versions did actually attract matter just like normal but nothing could actually get in past the event horizon. 

It was also proposed the white holes would be in another universe, something we’ll get too shortly, or were outright creating one, acting as a big bang inside the core of the black hole that spawned a whole new spacetime, a concept you’ll have encountered in many sci-fi stories, and it’s retained a lot of popularity among physicists too though it’s not the sort of thing you can really prove. 

As I recall it first hit popular culture in the 1979 Disney film The Black Hole, and the year before as a cameo in Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. 

The idea fell very out of favor after Stephen Hawking proposed the idea of black holes evaporating rather than being eternal objects. 

This was actually a few years before those came out but ideas take a while to percolate. 

This is the big one-way wormhole option though since you can’t go into a white hole and you can’t go out of a black hole. 

Nothing would stop you from making a second pair near each other and backwards of course, and wormhole networks, especially the Roman Ring, are something we’ll also get to. 

Two way wormholes, our fifth topic, simply includes any you can go both ways through. 

That probably doesn’t require anymore explanation since it was the one-way variety that we really needed to talk about. 

Big thing on these is that you can generally see them, or see the other side. 

By default it would look a lot like a warped snowglobe of what was on the other side. 

Now topics 6 and 7 are the idea on intra and inter Universe wormholes. 

An Intra-Universe Wormhole opens up somewhere in your own Universe, and thus is handy for travel. 

The default wormhole of fiction is the Intra-Universe Two-Way Traversable Wormhole. 

It has the big advantage of letting you get around your own Universe quite quickly. 

It has the big disadvantage of raising the specter of time travel and the associated paradoxes we discussed back in episode two. 

More on that later, but this is the ideal wormhole in most cases. 

Topic 7, Inter-Universe wormholes, is one that connects two different universes. 

This first emerged in regard to white holes and the original Schwarzschild Wormhole or Einstein-Rosen Bridge. 

These are generally one-way wormholes too. 

If you’ve ever seen the 90’s sci-fi shows Sliders, this is what they were sliding through. 

I don’t remember what specific handwave they were using, if any, for why this always opened up on Earth and a close parallel of our society, rather than randomly dumped into space, or at a Big Bang, but it should be noted the idea isn’t necessarily confined to the Many Worlds Quantum Interpretation of Alternate Timelines. 

It could just be another Universe, totally unrelated to our own. 

There are a ton of different multi-verse options kicking around, much like wormhole theories. 

I do like this one – and let me emphasize I like it, not that I think it is firm science – because it is an option for getting out of a dying universe and one ironically related to where life would probably hang out near the end. 

A couple weeks ago we did the Civilizations at the End of Time first episode on Black Hole Farming and I pointed out two things there, that once the stars go out your only power source is black holes, and that one of the ways to tap black holes for power is to leach off their rotational energy until they stop spinning. 

Schwarzschild Wormholes, the original one basically, derive from solving Einstein’s Field Equations for a black hole that is not charged and is not spinning. 

Solutions for rotating black holes or charged black holes or both came later. 

They also predate the idea of Hawking Radiation as eternal black holes, and Hawking Radiation remains totally theoretical and has a lot of critics who still favor the eternal black hole notion, it’s the big strike against white holes too, and the idea of them opening up into new universes. 

A civilization looking to tap those black holes can use the rotational energy to live like kings for a very long time, until the black hole stops spinning. 

If it can’t live on the Hawking Radiation after that, either because there is none or it’s just too low and slow to keep your civilization together, you will have a non-rotating black hole sitting in front of you. 

I’ve always thought there was something poetic about the notion of just jumping in to check first hand if black holes did lead to other Universes at that point, since you’ve got nothing to lose. 

Of course you’d have at least a quadrillion years before you’d need to check that hypothesis. 

I have a soft spot for suicidally brave actions too. 

As a sidenote, folks were asking me after that video about maintaining those structures for timelines that made a trillion years look like an eyeblink and as I said at the time I have no idea how anyone would, but something that came up a lot is proton decay, the idea that even protons might have a half-life. 

They might, when I was school we thought it might be 10^30 years, it’s been pushed up to a minimum of 10^34 or 35 years more recently, but under the Standard Model it doesn’t have a half-life and that’s a prediction of Grand Unified Theories, particularly SUSY or Super Symmetry, along with magnetic monopoles which also still haven’t been observed. 

I don’t think Super Symmetry is dead, even though it’s been declared that in a lot magazines in the last few years, but it certainly taken some hard blows from predictions of it not panning out, especially at the Large Hadron Collider. 

One the big purposes of the Large Hadron Collider was to help check super-symmetry but another is to hunt for exotic matter, which leads us into to topic 8. 

Now we’ve talked about exotic matter before, specifically imaginary mass and negative mass. 

Exotic matter is a fairly loose term, some would include dark matter as an example but I know some folks who strongly disagree. 

Presumably because to them exotic means rare, which dark matter certainly is not, I generally view it as having exotic properties compared to what we know now. 

Either way with wormholes it usually means negative mass, same as when we talked about warp drive last time. 

The purpose it serves with wormholes is to make the throat stable so it doesn’t collapse. 

From a strictly conceptual standpoint you could think of it as rafter shoring up a tunnel. 

In practice it’s usually a thick or thin shell of the stuff down under the throat in the black hole version of the things. 

It exerts a positive gravitational force, repulsive rather than attractive, and that can keep the throat open. 

It’s also the way stable and naturally occurring wormholes might arise, since naturally occurring exotic matter could have taken primordial and tiny wormholes and widened them with time. 

Quite a few physical theories tend to figure there’s trillions of little wormholes blundering around everywhere. 

The Morris-Thorne or Ellis Wormhole on the other hand is huge, in order to use a black hole whose tidal forces wouldn’t shred a human apart, we talked about that more in the black hole duology of videos, but bigger black holes are a lot safer to be near ironically. 

In this case they have a mouth several hundred astronomical units across, that isn’t arbitrary and was selected specifically for survivable tidal stresses so you could go a lot smaller but this one needs something like a hundred million stars worth of exotic matter to hold open. 

That generally means it’s the sort of thing you’d build at the center of a galaxies to connect them to other galaxies, or maybe have a handful in one galaxy at most. 

The Visser Wormhole on the other hand aims for a mouth about a meter across and needs a Jupiter mass worth of the stuff. 

Visser also offered an alternative to ramming head first into exotic matter which would generally tend to be fatal and possible destabilize the wormhole too. 

Visser usually has this as a polyhedron whose struts are full of the exotic matter instead, so you just go in between them. 

And again way smaller, just big enough for a person to squeeze through, but that’s enough. 

Truth be told that’s a lot more than enough. 

You could presumably go way smaller, so your wormhole’s mouth was only big enough to pass a laser beam through and have communications as a result. 

That’s in the range of mass where could conceivably have one orbiting a planet like a communication satellite and doesn’t require planets worth of mass, exotic and mundane, to build. 

And from a tranhumanism perspective if you can send data you can send people. 

For those of you trying to figure out the most plausible artificial wormhole route would be, I would say, and just in my opinion, that Visser’s Polyhderal Wormholes are probably the best. 

I’ll attach his 1989 paper on it in the video description, it’s actually only 7 pages long and the math is in there but I think you can still get a lot out of it even if you can’t follow the math. 

Now for the longest time exotic matter, and the unreality of it, was probably the big thing preventing folks from researching wormholes more, as they appeared to be something that couldn’t be traversed even if you could somehow survive a trip into a black hole, between the tidal stresses and concerns of slamming into mass. 

But there are some artificial ways to arrange the geometry of mass making singularities like making a spinning ring shaped black hole, maybe by putting a lot of smaller black holes or neutron stars into Klemperer Rosette. 

More importantly we have gotten good indicators that exotic matter, or something with the characteristics of it, might exist somewhere other than in theoretical models. 

Which takes us to the Casimir Effect. 

In the classic example we take two conductive plates and stick them just a few billionths of a meter apart, and we suck out all the air in between them and around them so it’s a vacuum. 

There’s no field so nothing should happen, but what we observe is the plates feeling some force between them. 

This can be either attractive or repulsive depending on how we arrange the plates. 

Now this wasn’t experimental, Hendrik Casimir predicted this in 1948. 

Trying to prove it, trying to make two large smooth plates barely an atom’s width apart but still not touching, is obviously kind of tricky. 

The further the plates are away the weaker the force should be. 

It wasn’t until 1997 at Los Alamos someone managed to pull this off with any real certainty, and actually using a sphere and a plate instead of two plates, and it got nailed down even better in Italy in 2001. 

Until then no one was really sure this was happening, theory no matter how good is always very iffy until you’ve got experimental data. 

Now prior to that there were already plenty of notions for what might cause this mysterious force between the plates but Vaccum Energy was the one generally considered most interesting. 

The important thing was that you could generate a negative pressure. 

Now a negative pressure is a fairly straightforward concept, we use lower or higher pressure all the time, heck the whole point of an airplane wing is to ram through air at say 10 psi pressure and cause most of it to fly under the wing, increasing the pressure to say 11 psi, and less to go over the wing, at maybe 9 psi, generating a net upward pressure of 2 psi and keeping the plane from falling out of the sky. 

We do the reverse for the spoiler on a car to push it down so it can maintain contact with the road. 

But there’s no air, no pressure, in the chamber with the plates. 

It’s genuinely negative pressure. 

A lower pressure than nothing. 

Well there’s an energy associated to normal pressure, all those particles flying around whacking things have kinetic energy, temperature, mass, they have positive energy. 

So to have negative pressure you need negative energy. 

Less than zero. 

Now negative energy isn’t quite the same as negative mass but functionally it can probably be used as a substitute and it’s not a bad indicator that negative mass particles might exist or could be created. 

Or that those negative matter struts in the Visser wormhole might simply be charged up with negative energy for instance. 

Or charged down I suppose. 

Okay, topic 10, Naked Singularities. 

One of the problems with black holes of course is that all the neat stuff is going on beneath the event horizon. 

A naked singularity doesn’t have this, the original notion being that if I spun a dense chunk of matter fast enough it would form into a ring exposing the singularity. 

This violates the Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis Roger Penrose came up with in 1969 which argues that if you saw a naked singularity reality would break down. 

Well, causality would break down but honestly that amounts to the same thing. 

Of course it explicitly excludes the Big Bang, which gets exempted from a lot of things. 

I think people forget sometimes there were some very solid objections to the Big Bang theory when it first got proposed that stuck around for a long time and its blatant violation of Thermodynamics was just one of them. 

History often makes out such debates as being wise visionaries versus stubborn old cranks or irrational lunatics but usually that’s not how it was. 

Not that there is ever a shortage of old cranks and lunatics or a surplus of wise visionaries, they just tend to be more evenly distributed. 

If Naked Singularities did exist and didn’t violate causality it would in principle make some types of wormholes a lot easier to make. 

It’s also an option under Loop Quantum Gravity which has gotten to be a popular area of research and theory in the last few decades. 

Topic 11, Quantum Entanglement and Wormholes. 

Back in episode one I discussed quantum entanglement and some misconceptions about it, one of the folks commented on me leaving out ER=EPR, and I told him I was saving it for our look at wormholes. 

This is one of Leonard Susskind’s more recent ideas and in a nutshell suggests that entangled particles are actually connected by a non-traversable wormhole. 

This doesn’t actually change anything we discussed in that episode but I wanted to wait till we had discussed traversable versus non-traversable wormholes to bring it up. 

Since they’re non-traversable, the ER standing for Einstein-Rosen bridge which we already mentioned weren’t traversable, you still can’t use entangled particles to send information faster than light. 

Personally I love the idea, the notion of little Planck scale wormholes connecting two entangled particles that breaks when they cease being entangled is just neat. 

No idea if it’s true, but it’s gotten pretty popular and I think it deserves mention. 

It’s a very elegant solution and I always like those in science. 

Topic 12, Time Travel in Wormholes. 

Not Time travel with wormholes, that in a bit, but a question that comes up sometimes is how long it takes to travel through one and if it is instant. 

It isn’t, though it kind of depends on when you are officially beginning the wormhole. 

Wormholes are sometimes classified by basically how horribly deadly the trip would be and traversable ones are usually labeled as benign, there’s also ‘absurdly benign, which the Visser wormhole usually qualifies as. 

In the context of spherically symmetric wormhole you’ve got to drop down through the mouth, down the throat, and out through the other mouth. 

That does take actual time and as I mentioned earlier your time is very slowed down. 

It doesn’t really have anything to do with distance between the two mouths in real space though. 

I’ve seen some calculations that worked out to be about second for the absurdly benign and small Visser Wormhole and the better part of a year for the bigger Thorne or Ellis Wormhole, but I never duplicated them or checked if that was internal time for the passenger or time passed in the external Universe, again time slows down inside a black hole, and I suppose it technically wouldn’t matter as we’ll see in a moment but so much focus is put on using these things as time machines that very little gets put on the time spent inside one. 

If it took you centuries for instance, in external time, to get through one it’s a bit dubious if it’s all that advantageous to have them for anything not light centuries or further apart. 

Okay Topic 13, Time Travel and wormholes. 

We already covered all the weird temporal paradox stuff back in episode two so I’m just going to explain how that happens with a wormhole, and why it presumably doesn’t matter how long it takes you to go through one in external time, just your own subjective scale. 

As we know from special relativity if I take an object up to high speeds time slows down for it, so if I take off in spaceship and fly out at near the speed of light and loop around and come home a century later I might only have experienced a few years myself. 

So we make a wormhole, stick one mouth in orbit around Earth, and fly the other off at relativistic speeds somewhere. 

The tug ship with its wormhole leaves in say the year 2200. 

So far this isn’t a big deal, but as they’re almost there, traveling at near the speed of light but not quite at it, a message catches up saying the deal’s off, the colony’s representative on Earth cancelled the order and to bring it back. 

Now when they turn around and loop home it’s been a century back on Earth, it’s the year 2300 but only a few years for them. 

The clocks at the mouths of the wormhole are synchronized so at the mouth that stayed at Earth it’s a century forward in time but on the space ship only a few years have passed. 

The crew is fine, they haven’t only aged a few years but they haven’t traveled in time. 

But when an inspector checking the stabilizing elements of the wormhole slips and falls through he’s spewed out in the year 2203. 

Now Hypothetically you could move both ends of a wormhole to keep them synchronized but the big thing is that one mouth is back in time from the other if you don’t, so jumping through sends you back in time. 

This is ultimately the biggest black mark against wormholes because it seems unavoidable that you could use them as time machines and the general feeling is that time travel has to be impossible. 

Of course this only applies to Intra-Universe Traversable Wormholes, one way or two way. 

If they exit out into another Universe or you can’t send information through them then cause and effect, causality, is safe. 

Though you almost invariably would get mouths of wormholes that went back in time, this doesn’t necessarily result in violating causality, it’s when you get them close that it does. 

For instance if I’ve got one that’s 50 year back in time but 100 light years away a message sent from it, like “Warn President Kennedy not to go to Texas” still takes 100 years to arrive and thus gets there 50 years later. 

You have to worry about link ups of many wormholes though, in what’s called a Roman Ring allowing for causality violations though you can also avoid them by configuring your ring correctly too. 

Okay let’s move on to our last topic, other uses of wormholes, as well as some popular suggested uses that might not work. 

And if I don’t say otherwise assume I’m talking about an Intra-Universe Two Way Traversable one. 

A lot of times with wormholes in fiction someone will suggest you could make a perpetual motion machine by opening a gate near the ground and the other end up in the air and just dropping a ball into the lower mouth, it comes out the top, falls down picking up speed, goes in again and pops back out near the top getting faster and faster on each drop. 

Now in practice it actually wouldn’t because of air friction stopping the acceleration at terminal velocity but you could just put a water wheel between the two mouths and dump water through, and harvest power. 

But under general relativity this won’t work, the ball or water falling through the lower wormhole will actually do work passing through it and lose the kinetic energy gained. 

The Traverse through the wormhole is effectively back up again. 

You might fall down the first mouth into the throat but you have to spend energy getting back up out of the throat and the other mouth and it will always match whatever the change in potential energy was. 

So this doesn’t work, at least in models consistent with general relativity. 

However using them as power sources is still quite doable. 

I mentioned in the Terraforming video how much easier wormholes, if they exist, make terraforming planets. 

You could for instance hang one in a 24-hour orbit around your planet and dump the other end as close to the sun, or even in the sun, as your mouth and stabilizing equipment can handle without being destroyed. 

Bang, mini sun. 

You could do the same and exit it out into some water inside a steam engine turning turbines too. 

Bang, free power, or kinda free anyway, the sun is just footing the bill. 

Ditto in the backside of a rocket ship, so the exit mouth is just spewing out hot plasma from the star and pushing you along. 

We almost always picture these as being in space but that isn’t necessarily required, one thing I liked about Stargate was them being on the ground in modern times. 

Peter Hamilton’s Commonwealth Saga, one of my favorite Scifi series, has them on planets with the novel inclusion of running trains through them from world to world and power supplies too, so you can put all your nuclear reactors on some worthless rock of a planet for instance and run superconducting cables out through the gate to other worlds. 

Of course you can use them to bulk transport mass too, sucking air off one world to terraform another, even sucking mass in or out to alter the gravity. 

Though it’s worth remembering that any mass going into one slightly disrupts it and putting through mass equal to the wormhole should make it explode. 

When you’re trickling it through over long time periods you can presumably stabilize it continuously but opening one up to suck a planet through is not going to work in most models unless the mass of the wormholes is way, way larger, which of course it would be if it had a throat the size of a planet, remember the Visser Wormhole’s mouth is only a meter across and it needs a whole Jupiter worth of exotic matter alone to create that. 

Now for Inter-Universe Wormholes this is maybe useful too, since you could open one up to a hotter younger universe maybe, or a colder older one. 

Getting heat or mass from the former though they are usually one way and you’d expect to be on the outgoing end of the tunnel. 

But they could be two way or let you be on the incoming end. 

It’s a nice cheat for entropy, but if you could traverse one you can still cheat by just jumping into a younger fresh Universe probably. 

Of course they make awesome weapons too, especially if you can open them wherever you please as small as you like, letting you for instance open up a tiny one to look through then opening another up in front of machinegun and the bullets fly through targeted by the wormhole, upscaled you could send huge laser blast like those we discussed in the Nicoll-Dyson Beam video out wherever you pleased. 

You could open one just inside the other ship too, since it would cut right through armor and defenses, again these aren’t passing through space in a straight line. 

The flipside would be defense, since you could open wormholes up a decent distance from your planet or ship and get early warning of even laser beams coming in and potentially precision open one in front of it that exited away from your ship or planet. 

This of course assumes you can control where they open. 

Currently to get a wormhole where you want requires either making both ends near each other and dragging them where you like or opening one, figuring out where it exited, and collapsing it if it doesn’t get you closer to your destination and restabilizing it again. 

And then probably towing it to a precise location anyway. 

But even if you can’t control the destination at all and it pops up randomly anywhere in the Universe, even outside the Observable Universe, you just keep re-opening it till its close to some place that looks like a nice candidate for colonization and then stabilize it there. 

This would have the amusing effect of meaning the closest colonies to Earth, in terms of Transit time, might be a billion light years away and you might need to pass through hundreds of gates each billion of light years from each other to get to a star system only a hundred light years away. 

A common suggested use is just for communication, very tiny wormholes just big enough to allow a signal through. 

An obvious continuation on this notion is including them inside very large computers to allow you to avoid signal lag. 

This has the problem though of bottlenecking depending on how much energy it costs to maintain a wormhole, how small you can make them, and how much energy and time is spent putting each photon through. 

Wormholes aren’t free, they take a lot of material to make, take time to pass through, and require maintenance to keep them stable. 

So if they exist and can be made small there would still be a point of diminishing returns, whether that is so small you could use them between each processor or so big only a full blown Matrioshka Brain wired up to twins in other solar systems would benefit from it is impossible to yet say. 

But we’ve talked a lot about heat a lot recently as the big constraint on a lot of our projects like maximizing calculations or building huge planet-sprawling super-cities, Ecumenopolises. 

Wormholes presumably let you cheat at that too. 

You could use them as a massive air conditioning system for a planet that you dumped heat through and supercharge that by having another connecting to places that were very cold. 

It would probably take a lot juice to make and maintain that and pump the heat, but you could probably make it a net positive system to cool a planet where you were grabbing huge amounts power to run it way beyond what you should be able to without boiling the place. 

Of course if you got easy access to exotic matter, negative mass, that could be very handy in constructing over-sized buildings that ought to collapse under their own mass too. 

I mentioned in the Ecumenopolis video that the big brother of a planet-wide city would be a multi-layered one or even what I dubbed a Planet Cloud, sort of mini-Dyson Swarm around a planet, and wormholes would make building one and running it far more energetically a lot easier. 

But very small and cheap wormholes arguably make one redundant anyway. 

If you can make them easily and put them where you want even a Dyson Swarm for habitation gets a bit redundant since you can make a small one for just sucking up power from a star and transport that wherever you want, while folks could have a house inside an asteroid in another part of the galaxy and just step through to Earth, or even have a house with rooms on different planets, or in different universes if you could make two-way inter-universe wormholes. 

That notion got played with a bit in Dan Simmons Hyperion Cantos, houses with rooms on different planets, and the idea of houses with rooms in different Universe gets played with in one of the later books in the Roger Zelazny’s Chronicles of Amber. 

Pretty neat concept as an extension of our modern one of the internet and cloud computing, where the physical location of your files might be on the other side of the planet but right at your fingertips. 

I’m not sure how practical it would be but it would be kinda awesome to have a closet in your apartment that opened up to a huge walk in closet among millions in some huge warehouse on another planet, or a balcony in your bedroom that opened up to some terraced vista on another world. 

So some fun food for thought to close things out. 

I regret we couldn’t get into the math and I hate to say that like all the other concepts we discussed in this series for getting around the speed of light I don’t think this one will pan out. 

But it’s probably the most promising options and I’d love to be proved wrong. 

Next Week we’re going to look at Tabby’s Star, the candidate system folks have be suggesting might be a Dyson Sphere or other Megastructure, and we’ll talk about SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and I’m going to talk about some of the methods, some of the proposed method, and some of the difficulties with them.

Habitable Planets 06: Water Worlds & Ocean Planets
---
  
2016-07-22  
https://youtu.be/At2BWcWqxRA  

---

So today we are looking at Water Worlds, places that consist entirely of water on their surface with no land at all. 

We’ll be discussing how they might still have land life in spite of that, how life might evolve there, and how we might terraform such a planet ourselves. 

Now it has been a while since we were in the Habitable Planets series, we’ve been off covering a lot of other topics, many inter-connected, so it will be nice break to talk about a subject that is a lot more down to Earth, at least as much as discussing an alien world could be considered down to Earth. 

Though by the standards of this channel this subject is about as close as we come to that. 

If you’re new to the channel I will occasionally reference associated topics we’ve covered in more detail elsewhere, and you’ll often see a video link pop-up you can click on to pause this video and watch that one in a new window. 

Also if you haven’t gotten used to my voice yet it’s a good idea to turn on the closed caption subtitles on the video. 

We tend to move through a lot of info quickly so anything that makes it easier for you to understand me is a good idea. 

On that note, if you are a veteran to this channel I should add that we will be going at a slower pace for this video, I think I’ve been slamming through material a little too quickly in recent ones and I felt like we should take our time for this trip. 

Whenever we look at these planets in this series we have certain goals we aim to achieve and questions that need answering, and I thought I’d list them out formally this time. 

These are: 1) What are the specific traits of these planets? 

2) Are there any important sub-categories? 

3) How likely or uncommon are such planets? 

4) How likely is life on them? 

5) How likely is complex or intelligent life? 

6) How would we terraform such a planet? 

Now most of the time in this series I’d ask if we could terraform a given type of planet but if you’re a regular to this channel you know the answer is always yes, heck last week we were talking about basically terraforming black holes, so I’m not even going to bother answering if we can terraform a planet covered in water, just talk about some of the options unique to Oceanic Planets. 

Ditto, on a planet covered in liquid water, which is our main trait used to define the Habitable Zone of a solar system, if liquid water can exist there, it would seem a bit pointless to ask if life can emerge on such planets. 

We’ll instead look at how in some cases it might not, and some challenges some types of Oceanic planets might face for complex life to emerge. 

So let’s start with #1, what are the specific traits of these planets? 

What makes a planet an Ocean World and what other features might we expect. 

Well the simple answer is it is a planet almost completely covered in water, though it might have some small landmasses and ice at the poles, and today we aren’t interested in a world that’s totally covered in ice though we will be talking about ice quite a lot, even on ones with none on the surface because there’s a lot of different types of ice and some can exist at room temperature or even temperatures that would boil water normally. 

More on that in a bit. 

Today I am defining this broad category of planets into those which contain little or no land, at least in the sense of land being rocks and dirt left over from volcanic eruptions and tectonic upheaval above the sea level. 

And it is tricky for us to predict how common that actually is on planets because we still don’t know what drives our tectonic plates, or what the prime force driving them is. 

There’s many theories, that it’s convection in the mantle over them or that old plates get denser and sink being the two most popular currently. 

And we don’t know how much tidal forces of moon or sun play a role in this. 

Stacked again that, we know the sun and moon both play a huge role in erosion of land. 

Waves crashing onto rock, tides lowering and raising the sea level, storms, rain, wind etc all act to erode rocky landmasses and in a world with no tectonic activity they’d eventually wear down the landscape, and if they were stronger they’d do it faster. 

A world with very little tectonics and a great deal of erosive forces could easily become one in which there was no land even if the seas weren’t very deep. 

Similarly if your oceans are a lot deeper, it’s much harder for land to emerge up through all that extra water. 

And water is very common in the universe because hydrogen and oxygen are the first and third most abundant elements. 

Earth is just under a third each iron and oxygen, with the remaining third being mostly silicon and magnesium, but oxygen is much more common in the crust and iron in the core. 

The rock and dirt you walk on, the water your drink and swim in, is mostly oxygen, because oxygen is so common in the Universe. 

Yet hydrogen and helium are much more common in the Universe and nearly absent from Earth, and oxygen is a lot less common on the Planet Mercury for instance. 

We’ve talked about this before and it comes down to three big factors. 

The sun tends to hammer planets with ionizing radiation that strips off lighter elements, especially helium which can’t chemically bond to anything to form heavier molecules and solids. 

Retaining lighter elements then comes down to three things: 1) How massive or dense a planet is. 

Increasing these increases the escape velocity of the planet and those particles trying to flee it. 

2) How strong its magnetosphere is. 

Since that will help keep back some of the radiation stripping the particles and can bounce many fleeing ones back down, and... 

3) How hot the planet is. 

Since that indicates both how much radiation it is being exposed to and what the overall temperature is. 

Temperature provides a large initial boost to each particles speed, especially lighter elements, that make them easier to whack with radiation and add enough speed to lift them off the planet. 

We’ve talked about that in more detail in the Terraforming video. 

What it means in a nutshell is that planets much lighter than earth generally won’t have true atmospheres and so can’t have liquid water either, water just doesn’t exist as a liquid below 600 pascals, or 6 millibars of pressure, about 0.6% of Earth sea level air pressure, and even above that there’s a much lower range of temperatures that permit liquid water to exist than we’re used to. 

There’s an experiment we often do in introductory physics courses where we stick a cup of water at room temperature under a jar and pump out air until it boils. 

Pressure is always pushing on water molecules trying to stick them together while temperature pushes them outward, trying to force them apart, liquids basically exist in that range where neither is winning the fight. 

When pressure wins and dominates the situation you generally get a solid and when temperature wins you get a gas. 

That pressure and temperature vary by each substance and you can get many different types of solids with some substances, including normal old water ice. 

That will important in a bit too. 

Now pressure is a factor of only how strong gravity is at a given spot and how much stuff is sitting on top of it. 

You’ve got roughly 14 pounds of air sitting over every square inch of your head for instance, 14 PSI, or around ten tons on every square meter, 10,000 kilograms or about 100,000 Pascals, or 100 kilopascals or 0.1 Megapascals. 

You’d also know this as a bar of pressure, a bar being exactly 100 kilopascals or .1 megapascals, or an atmosphere of pressure. 

It’s actually a bit more at sea level, an atmosphere is 1.01 bars. 

Up here in Ohio where I live it’s usually a bit less than that, about .98 Bar or .97 atmosphere. 

These can get confusing sometimes because while the one is calibrated off sea level the other is in metric and just coincidentally they are very close to each other. 

In case you’re wondering Mars’s atmosphere at the surface is 6 millibars which as I mentioned is the point where liquid water ceases becoming possible at any temperature so it wouldn’t take much more air to allow liquid water on Mars. 

So lighter planets have a problem holding on to air and water. 

Alternatively heavier planets can hold on to it much easier so we actually expect, all things being equal, that planets bigger than Earth would have more water on them proportionally. 

But they also have less surface area to spread that around on. 

If I keep density the same and just double a planet’s mass, I’d only increase it’s radius by about 26% percent and its surface area by 59%. 

Yet it would have double the water even if it only had the same percentage of its mass made of water, so the water would be 26% deeper on average. 

Like I said though, you’d expect if Earth were more massive it would have more water proportionally too, because much less of its hydrogen would escape. 

So its ocean could be even deeper. 

I’ve mentioned this in regard to the Fermi Paradox, the question of where all the aliens are, as an example of how a planet might be uninhabitable, at least to technological life, from even a minor change to Earth’s mass since we might have no liquid water if we were just a bit less massive and so much water there’d be no land if we were a bit more. 

We’re not really sure yet where that critical point comes in though, since planetary modeling is still pretty new and hasn’t got tons of real world data from exoplanets to plug in to check it. 

But the indications so far are that worlds significantly more massive than Earth and similar in temperature will have more water, and that planets significantly less massive will either be icy if cold or lack much ocean, maybe any at all. 

So even though the main trait of a water world is simply having a lot of water, we are seeing a second related trait that they probably tend to be massive. 

Don’t confuse this with ice-covered planets or moons like Europa where under the ice there’s liquid water, different topic for a different day. 

That’s our third trait though, they need to be warm enough to have liquid water with only air and space between that water and the sun, which also puts photosynthesis on the table, more on that later. 

So let’s move onto our second topic for today, sub-categories of these planets. 

This is mostly about depth of the water. 

There’s really no official names for these yet and the two subcategories created at Orion’s Arm, a site those of you who are regulars here know I like to reference a lot, don’t satisfy me in this case as a good system. 

There they use Bathypelagic and Panthallasic to refer to water worlds where the oceans are less than 50 kilometers deep, or 30 miles, for the former and more for the latter. 

This is non-ideal because it’s not describing them in anything but arbitrary depth, though the break isn’t entirely arbitrary, 30 miles is twice as high as the tallest mountain in the solar system, Olympus Mons on Mars, where there is no significant erosion to shorten it and less gravity to prevent it getting higher, so we can safely assume land masses arising from an ocean floor will very rarely get that high and thus couldn’t be dry land, just underwater mountains. 

But as I said, this doesn’t satisfy because we have more variables in mind. 

So let’s create four planets based on water depth and erosive and tectonic net effects. 

Now Thalassic and Pelagic both mean water or sea in old Greek but Pelagic is what we use for defining oceanic zones here on Earth so I will stick with that. 

Personally I prefer to consider them all Panthalassic but that’s because I can’t pronounce worlds and Panthalassic Planets suits me better than Water Worlds. 

It’s also Greek, Pan, all, Thalassic, sea, and you’re supposed to use Greek or Latin for this stuff or people might not think you’re doing science. 

Plus I hated that film, Waterworld, in spite of being a big fan of Kevin Costner as an actor and director. 

A couple years later he did the film Postman adapted from the book of the same name by eminent author and physicist David Brin and I think it’s a pity he didn’t do them backwards since he could have consulted Brin about a Waterworld, something he discussed in his Uplift series at one point. 

Of course he’d probably have told Costner that if you melted every drop of ice at our poles you’d still have a ton of land left over and scuttled the project or just been ignored, but I’m digressing again. 

So Panthalassic Planets will be the type name, and we will use pelagic for our subtypes. 

Now the Pelagic Zones we use are a bit arbitrary for the lower ones so we’ll be lumping them together and taking some liberties with them, along with creating a new one, Stereopelagic. 

Here are my four: 1) Epipelagic Planets – planets where only a thin skin of water covers the planet but covers it basically everywhere, such planets would only exist where erosive forces seriously beat out tectonic forces creating land. 

I am including the mesopelagic zone in these, but basically they would be planets where if you couldn’t hold your breath and swim to the bottom in most places, you could scuba your way down. 

Epi means over in Greek and we’re thinking of it like Epidermis, your top layer of skin. 

Mesopelagic, meso, simply means middle, like mesolithic means middle stone age. 

2) Bathypelagic – Planets where the ocean depths are more comparable to the norm on Earth, erosive forces dominate tectonics enough that you don’t get landmasses except maybe the occasional small island. 

These would be places where the ocean is miles deep almost everywhere, potentially even deeper than the deepest trenches on Earth. 

Bathypelagic means deep sea. 

3) Abyssopelagic – On Earth this is the next layer after the Bathypelagic but you still have one more, the Hadopelagic, reference Hades, that is pretty arbitrary and mostly just applies to ocean trenches. 

Abyss meaning endless in Greek, while on Earth this begin just four kilometers down we will be assuming it begins deeper today, Abyssopelagic Planets for today will assume any planet where even strong tectonic forces simply aren’t enough to cause land to rise up through all that water. 

We can’t put an actual depth to that, since not only would it vary from planet to planet but we don’t have the science for it just yet. 

As I mentioned we don’t actually know what drives Tectonic forces for sure. 

For today it is a planet where even strong tectonics can’t hoist land up over all that water but there is actually land down there eventually. 

Now you might say, well no duh, every planet would have land eventually but not quite, and that gives us our fourth category. 

4) Stereopelagic – Stereo actually means solid in Greek, so Solid Ocean would be the meaning here. 

As we’ll see in a bit water under enough pressure, even at high temperatures, can become ice, and ice denser than normal water so it wouldn’t float up. 

Not only is the water to deep to possibly allow any surface land but there’s not even land at the bottom of the sea, just a thick layer of ice. 

In case you are curious the use of stereo to describe sound emerged in the 1920s term stereophonics, literally solid sound, which might be regarded as a bit of marketing made up word for better sound quality. 

It’s an interesting mutation because we mostly know stereo from the sound device for giving you a left and right ear sound, or the word stereotype, which itself is a mutation off of the original stereotype, which meant printing with a solid plate of type rather than movable type printing presses, and its modern form associated to bigotry is also from the 1920s. 

Stereoscopic images at least influences the word stereophonic, since those involved producing an image which seemed more solid when viewed by using two separate images too give a 3D effect, one which was more solid as it were, and was very popular in the 19th century. 

Here we are using it very literally, Stereopelagic, solid ocean, as our deepest Panthalassic Planet Type, oceans which might go a hundred miles or more deep, and above that Abyssopelagic Planets, for ones of seeming endless depth until many miles down you hit land. 

Above that Bathypelagic Planets where the oceans are as deep or decently deeper than on Earth, and the lack of land is simply due to a mix of depth and greater erosive forces. 

And finally, our shallowest, Epipelagic, where the ocean is not very deep at all, no more than most lakes, and these can exist only because of very weak tectonics mixed with powerful erosion. 

That erosion incidentally need not be entirely natural, in this sense possibly being a byproduct of life itself. 

We’ll talk about these in detail now, but we’ll be adding in our third, fourth and fifth topics as we go through each individually and summarize those at the end of our look at the 4 sub-types. 

Those again were how common or likely such a planet is, how likely life would be on them, and how likely it would be for complex or intelligent life to show up on them. 

So let’s talk about these in a bit more detail, and back down in order of depth. 

An Epipelagic Planet is a very shallow one. 

These probably wouldn’t be terribly common because it’s not very likely a planet could have so little tectonics as to keep a planet that nearly smooth and still have water and air. 

After all even the occasional large asteroid strike ought to spoil that smoothness. 

But they wouldn’t be so rare as the double planets and Rocheworlds we discussed last time either. 

As I mentioned I wrapped in the mesopelagic zone to this planet type too. 

On Earth the Epipelagic Zone, also known as the Photic Zone, is the first 200 meters or 660 feet of water, where photosynthesis is actually possible. 

This will be the case on most other planets too though those with thicker atmospheres won’t get as much light through and it might be decently less there. 

It wouldn’t be much more though because a planet that received more illumination that could penetrate deeper would also be much hotter. 

The Mesopelagic, which extends beneath that to about kilometer of depth, is too deep for photosynthesis but still light enough for vision to be useful. 

Virtually all marine life lives in these two zones and it is the Epipelagic that is the main food pump for marine life. 

Now the reason this is an important sub-type is because there is no problem at all with getting nutrients and minerals to the area where photosynthesis can take place. 

That is big issue with the others 3 types. 

On our Epipelagic Planets water currents can easily transport stuff from the sea floor up to the light-heavy regions for plants to use and it would be possible for plants to grow like trees from the bottom all the way to the top, although that would be trickier for plants who were growing in areas where the light didn’t get all the way down to the sea floor strong enough to allow photosynthesis. 

But the epipelagic does go down 660 feet, deeper than the tallest redwood trees are high, and there is seaweed that has been measured nearly 200 meters tall too. 

So you could get some very tall marine flora, and such worlds actually ought to hyper-abundant in life. 

On Earth, outside of the shallow regions, the ocean tends to be low on life even in the photic zone because there just isn’t much nutrients available and plants have had to adapt to be able to even just get that. 

Where the ocean is shallower, closer to the shore, life is much more abundant because nutrients are readily available to plants by either being directly accessible or easily kicked up by tides and currents to that height. 

So that’s our definition for an Epipelagic planet, one which weirdly has no land above water but is still close enough to the sea floor that plants can either directly reach it, and sunlight, or that currents drive nutrients up regularly. 

Which if there is a lot of erosive force would presumably be easier too. 

You would expect life, if it arises, to be super-abundant compared even to Earth, an Epipelagic Planet should be a giant biomass pump. 

Now you would think life would be very likely to arise on search worlds but that’s not a given. 

We have three probable causes for the origin of life, in a modern scientific context anyway. 

Tidal pools, oceanic thermal vents, and panspermia. 

Now Panspermia, the notion that the simple precursors for life, or even very simple life, might have rained down on Earth isn’t in great favor and often attracts some mystic woo and pseudoscience elements but it remains a decent theory for abiogenesis and obviously would work as well on this planet as any other, so no problem. 

Tidals pools wouldn’t actually exist on a landless planet but reasonable approximations of that same effect, essentially making a nice solution of mud, would be quite abundant. 

Thermal Vents less so, since we have said these planets would exist primarily because tectonic forces giving rise to volcanic activity wouldn’t be strong, and so you wouldn’t expect as many thermal vents though that’s hard to say for sure. 

Last I checked that was the preferred theory for the origin of life over tidal pools and both are normally considered vastly more likely than panspermia, so these worlds could remain barren lifeless mudballs. 

I don’t think it’s a stretch to assume they would have life, and complex life would have no serious barriers to existence either after that, including intelligence. 

But you can’t have fire on a Panthalassic Planet because everything is either underwater or constantly drenched. 

Now to get around that, first we could assume plants formed dry areas, either treetops, as it were, extending above the water or actual rafts. 

It isn’t inconceivable you might get some analog to dry land on some of those. 

Ditto you could get ice at the poles and icebergs drifting south and maybe things would live on those even if just as a place to hang out to fish from. 

But even in that scenario they would have to carry their rock up from the seabed manually and I can’t see them ever developing metal. 

A scenario for technological civilization arising from a world like this, or any of our Panthalassic Planet types, probably does exist but it would seem very contrived and improbable. 

Alternatively once technology did exist it would be easy enough to maintain so it would be no issue for a civilization to setup shop on such a planet that arose elsewhere. 

So ignoring that these planets probably aren’t too common, though probably not incredibly rare either, and also the possible thermal vent issue for letting life begin there in the first place, Epipelagic Planets are ideal for life, better than Earth probably at least for pumping out raw quantity, but not for creating technological civilizations. 

Bathypelagic Planets would be a bit harder on life. 

These planets are likely a lot more common than Epipelagic but the depth of the oceans makes transport of nutrients up to the Photic Zone quite tricky. 

Especially since we’ve already stipulated that most of these probably have oceans deeper than our own Bathypelagic Zone on Earth usually ends at or much less tectonic activity, otherwise they’d have land. 

You could get life around the thermal vents, but unless there were at least some islands or lots of spots where the land rose nearly to the surface it would be hard to get much nutrient up to the photic zone. 

I already mentioned that those parts of our own ocean that go that deep tend to be fairly barren even up in their photic zone from a lack of nutrients but it is actually a bit worse here because we still have plenty of land sweeping nutrients out to ocean before they sink too deep. 

So Bathypelagic Planets could certainly have life deep down near thermal vents, but that’s not very nourishing at a planetary scale, and they’d have a tough time getting anything going up in the photic zone. 

Indeed the main source for energy for life in our own Bathypelagic Zone is Marine Snow, a term for the constantly falling, snow-like appearing detritus of flora and fauna in the upper zones. 

I think you’d almost need a reverse snow, dead matter and nutrient carrying itself upwards, to get this to work. 

But you need some sort of pump putting nutrients up where the sun could reach, or a ton of thermal vent activity which would seem to counter-indicate not having any landmasses. 

So these planets would probably have life, but it wouldn’t likely get very abundant and that would make long food chains to support large animals in large quantity tricky so intelligent life would seem unlikely. 

It has even more of a problem developing technology than Epipelagic Planets if intelligence did arise though. 

A Bathypelagic planet would probably need to have a lot of just barely submerged mountains or many tiny islands to still qualify as a Panthalassic Planet yet get the nutrients needed. 

If it had a lot of islands or atolls to permit genuinely abundant life you might regard that sub-subtype as an archipelago planet. 

Archipelago or maybe for consistency archipelagic, since it does have pelagos in there, though archipelago translates as chief sea, and if you are wondering what chief sea means that would make it now mean a chain of islands, that was very literal originally. 

The Aegean Sea southeast of Greece was called Archipelago, chief sea, in a bit of understandable egocentrism. 

It also happens to be filled to the brim with tiny islands. 

The word mutated a lot over the years and into modern Italian when it came to mean any place studded with islands. 

You’d expect these just as much on an Epipelagic Planet too, but they aren’t necessary for abundant life there while they are on a Bathypelagic Planet, they probably do deserve their own subcategory since they straddle both and are also like to be a bit different. 

The Galapagos Islands, also known as the Archipelago de Colon, gets the latter name for Christopher Columbus, who is Colombo in Portugese and Colon in Spanish. 

The other name, Galapagos, means saddle in Spanish but is actually for the giant tortoises they found there whose shells resembled saddles. 

I mention this because the Galapagos Islands are best known as the place where Charles Darwin did a lot of his work, and because those tortoises as well as the mockingbirds resident there differed from island to island and helped him get the notion of evolution and origin of species put together. 

That’s important today not just as a nod to Darwin but as a reminder that little tiny islands can cause lots of biodiversity as you get small isolated populations inbreeding together passing mutations quite quickly, meaning two little islands originally connected but having a been separated even just a few thousands year before by the sinking of the connecting bridge could have serious large differences in the two sub-species of each animal and plant that remained on each island. 

This could cause a lot of biodiversity aiding advanced life developing and since there is land, these are plausible candidates for technological civilizations to arise from. 

I should also note you can get this same effect with submerged islands in proximity to each other, since you’d expect life to be abundant there but minimal interchange between less mobile plants and animals who could not migrate, or rarely migrated, between the two. 

Our next type, Abyssopelagic planets, is actually a very bad candidate for life, but a great one for terraforming. 

Here the oceans are simply so deep that even if the planet is very tectonically active it just can’t thrust mountains up to the surface and nutrients have no way to get up there especially not in sufficient quantity for life. 

Now let me adds three caveats to that. 

First, I should note that most of Earth’s water isn’t even in our oceans. 

For a long time, especially since we believe the formation of our moon involved the Earth being whacked by another smaller planet that tore off our crust and any water residing on the planet then, we assumed our oceans came from comets. 

Just in the last few years we’ve found huge amounts of water hundreds of miles below the surface, mostly locked up in a mineral called Ringwoodite. 

This puts some serious doubts on a lot of our planetary modeling in terms of where water comes from here on Earth and other planets since it means water can be far below the crust and in immense quantities. 

So Abyssopelagic Planets might be less common than we might expect since water if abundant might tend to get migrated down and cycled to and from like continents are with our mantle. 

However we could still easily have planets with oceans too deep to allow land formation so it likely just means Abyssopelagic planets wouldn’t be as common as we might first think. 

Second, even though it might turn out comets aren’t where Earth got most of its water, it is where it got some. 

Also while Saturn has very impressive rings these days it hasn’t always had them and odds are good Earth has had a nice set from time to time too. 

Planets often have rings, they vary in how big they are since they dwindle over time, either falling down or clumping into moons, and get replenished by collisions and the like. 

Earth doesn’t get a lot of meteor damage because Jupiter protects us by sucking up most asteroids but not all solar systems will have that arrangement so an Abyssopelagic Planet might get its nutrients from a fairly steady rain of dust. 

As is, Earth gets about 60 tons of space dust every day, stuff burning up in our atmosphere and floating down, or just random dust floating about we sweep up. 

There’s probably been times that was a lot higher and some planets, especially higher mass ones, probably could get a lot more. 

And as mentioned higher mass planets could be more likely to be covered in deep water to begin with. 

So caveat two, Abyssopelagic planets might get decently fed nutrients in their own photic zone to feed some plants. 

Of course how they migrated all the way up from deep under the ocean if that’s where life originated would be another story. 

Caveat three is the end, or beginning of that story because these planets could have a lot of volcanic activity and thus thermal vents way, way down at the bottom, so if that is where life originates they shouldn’t have any special problem originating there either. 

Those caveats aside the story doesn’t look great for Abyssopelagic Planets to host complex life with a chance for technology. 

Thermal Vents just don’t provide a great overall power source to allow robust ecosystems that could support hundreds of animals of the same species big enough to have human level intelligence and close enough in proximity to form civilizations. 

They obviously can’t have fire or metalworking either. 

But ironically this makes these places perfect for humans. 

It is a possible exception to the norm where we might actually be able to set up our own biosphere on an alien planet without necessarily damaging the local life and maybe even helping it. 

Now the terraforming on such planet would take two principals forms. 

The first would be building floating habitats for ourselves. 

If you’re not a regular on this channel the idea of building chains of floating islands or even whole continents on top of a huge ocean might seem pretty impressive but compared to the efforts involved in interstellar colonization or some of the megastructures we’ve looked at, even the modest ones, you’ll recognize that building thousands of artificial islands is not exactly a major effort compared to those involved in getting there in the first place. 

You could source the matter from asteroids or from deep under the sea. 

You’d probably start with the former and convert over to deep ocean mining once you had some in place. 

Now building an undersea dome ten or more miles underwater is one heck of task and there is no native light that deep to give you anything to look at, so a dome that deep is more for the aesthetics if you decide to light up your immediate area. 

For every ten meters you go down in the water you add one atmosphere or bar to the pressure, more on higher gravity worlds. 

At ten kilometers deep that’s a thousand atmospheres, double the depth, double the pressure. 

It’s still a lot less than you need to make diamonds or that they could withstand so diamond domes deep down under the sea would be plausible. 

Diamonds actually quite easy to make synthetically using microwave ovens. 

I wouldn’t suggest trying to use your home microwave oven to save on getting your significant other a ring but I wouldn’t be surprised if we start seeing diamond used in construction in the not too distant future and the Air Force has been looking at making cockpit windows out of it. 

A nice research project that emerged out of my old stomping grounds of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where I interned before my senior year as an undergraduate back when I was 19. 

Great base and there’s a wonderful air and space museum there should you ever been in the area. 

I seem to be big on digressions this time, probably as a result of going for a slower pace. 

Anyway you could have your floating islands and native Earth marine life up top and while you would expect Marine Snow to drift down to the native biology if there was any there’d be a decent chance to do this in a way that made it only food and not an invasive species. 

This would be harder around the domes if you decided to transplant life that could live off photosynthesis and lit the area outside up so you could see outside. 

You would need exterior lighting too, a light down on the sea floor would shine outside but you wouldn’t see anything for the same reason you can’t see well outside through a window at night when you have the lights on or see inside someone’s windows from outside if its daytime and they don’t have lights on. 

This brings up one of my favorite concepts for terraforming I’ve nicknamed vertical reefs, because you can hang chains of lights off the bottoms of your floating islands to help vegetation grow far deeper than the normal photic zone of the oceans and you could do the same for your dome below, as towers or roads of light. 

Or drifting out like tentacles from submarine cities floating a mile under water nowhere near land or the sea surface. 

This takes a lot of power but is pretty doable on the power scales available to species that do interstellar travel and we’ve talked about similar concepts in the Rogue Planets video a couple episodes back in this series and the Arcology and Ecumenpolis videos a couple weeks back on the channel. 

What’s interesting is that if the planet had native life, so long as you limited yourself to bringing in species that relied on light or first and second had byproducts of it to live, you could get away with not overlapping those two ecologies, and it is possible the waste from all that would generate a marine snow that might actually serve to help feed the native life letting it grow in quantity and spread out from the thermal vents it was otherwise limited to exist near. 

Now our next and last category is a quick one except for the chemistry. 

Stereopelagic planets, ones with solid water, would be places where the ocean was so deep the pressure got high enough to turn water solid. 

Ice, normal water ice we’re used to, is only one of many types of ice that can exist and some at temperatures so high that its maybe more accurate to think of them as solid crystallized water than ice. 

The others happen at higher pressures, those in the hundreds of Megapascals range, or thousands of atmospheres, and again under Earth gravity it take about ten meters of water to get another atmosphere of pressure or a hundred to get a Megapascal. 

A kilometer will get you ten megapascals, 10 kilometers a hundred, and the weirder stuff happens at the hundreds. 

In between 200-600 Megapascals, or 20 to 60 kilometers of depth, weird types of ice can form at cold but not supercold temperatures. 

Over 600 Megapascals you get Ice-VI forming at about the normal freezing temperature of water and up past that pressure it can start forming at room temperature or even nearing boiling temperature when up over a thousand megapascals, at depths in excess of a thousand kilometers, it transitions into Ice-VII Normally while we say the ocean depths are quite cold, they never get too cold because if ice forms it just drifts up toward the surface till it melts. 

Normal Ice is less dense than water which is why icecubes and icebergs float. 

Not so for Ice-VI or VII. 

Ice-VI is about 30% denser than water and both ICE-VII and VIII are closer to 70% denser. 

They both sink in water. 

But that’s still lighter than most stone, especially the denser kinds that get made under massive pressures. 

So Stereopelagic Planets literally have sea bottom composed not of rock but solid water. 

We already had a difficult task of transporting nutrient from the sea floor of Batyhpelagic Planets and a seemingly impossible one for Abyssopelagic Planets, but on Stereoplegaic Planets there wouldn’t even be a sea floor made of rocks, just solid water. 

These could only be terraformed by either doing floating islands with mass brought in from elsewhere or actually removing ocean for use on other planets or artificial habitats. 

There wouldn’t seem many scenarios for life to exist here, the place is simply too dilute. 

So I’d rate this is basically 0% likely to host intelligent life let alone anything technological native to it, and quite likely to be lifeless, certainly not possessed of rich ecosystems abundant with life the way Epipelagic and even Bathypelagic were. 

Though that’s a little hard to say for certain for no life at all as you could get sediment build up from eruptions deep below or space dust building up on the ice and some thermal flux. 

Now you might think such planets would be uncommon but it’s quite likely a large portion of Super-Earths are like this and we’ll know more in the relatively near future as we keep finding more and more super-earths among the exoplanets we’ve been finding and as we get better at looking at those. 

So the summary, we have our overall type, Panthalassic Planets, places where almost all the surface is water, with maybe polar ice and a few bits of land for the special category of Archipelagic Planets. 

We have our four other depth based sub-categories. 

Epipelagic, Bathypelagic, Abyssopelagic, and Stereopelagic. 

We’ve seen none of them except maybe the first should be particularly uncommon and even Epipelagic shouldn’t be too exceptional, and that life should be a high probability on any of them except the deepest Stereopelagic planets. 

But we’ve also seen that the deeper they are the harder it is for them to support lots of life, and that every one of them except the special case of Archipelagic is not friendly to the development of technology, even though intelligence could develop on Epipelagic and probably Bathypelagic too. 

We also saw each was terraformable, though for Stereopelagic it would be a rough time and maybe not a popular spot to live especially since the gravity would probably be high. 

So that’s Panthalassic Planets, Ocean Planets, and Water Worlds. 

Next week it is back to the Faster Than Light series to look at wormholes, where will discuss the theory, look at some of the problems with making them and how they could result in time travel causality loops, and also explore a lot of the overlooked uses of the things if they can be made to work like terraforming planets or serving as power plants or even refueling dying stars.

Civilizations at the End of Time: Black Hole Farming

Today’s topic, Black hole Farming, is going to be a difficult one because it’s a video I probably shouldn’t have made without covering other topics first, and also because it draws heavily on quite a few other videos I did make first. 

So it essentially amounts to three topics that we need to cover today and assumes a knowledge of the most recent videos on the channel, which means that if this is your first visit to this channel, while I normally try to make videos as standalone as possible and you probably can watch this without watching the others first, it isn’t advised. 

That said, it isn’t absolutely necessary and to help with that, whenever I bring up topics we’ve covered in more detail in other videos you will usually see an in-video link for that video pop up, and you can just click on it to pause this video and watch that one. 

You can also turn on the closed caption subtitles if you are having problems understanding me. 

So I said it was actually three topics, not just one, for today. 

What are those three topics? 

Well let’s list them out. 

1) Using Black Holes for Power Sources We’ve talked about this before but mostly in the context of Hawking Radiation from small, artificial black holes. 

Today’s video is focused on large, long-lived black holes, where Hawking Radiation is incredibly tiny and other methods are needed. 

So we’ll be discussing those other methods as well as what the implications of living on minimal Hawking Radiation would be like 2) The Fate of the Universe In this section we’ll go over the timeline of ages of the Universe fairly quickly, and also quickly cover some of the other ideas for Civilizations far in the future, which we may expand on in future videos. 

3) Black Hole Farming In the last section we’ll get into the meat of things, trying to contemplate what civilizations would be like that essentially fed themselves off black holes. 

It’s the concept of using black holes as the power source for your civilization, and actually creating or placing black holes to make that work best, which is the origin of the title. 

I think it summons to mind the image of farmer in coveralls with a pitchfork literally farming black holes but we’re sticking with it anyway. 

So without further ado, let’s dig in. 

Our first topic, using Black Holes as power sources is, as I mentioned, something we looked at before in the twin videos discussing Hawking Radiation, Micro-Black Holes, and using them to power starships. 

You may want to watch those, or re-watch those, before proceeding, but the quick summary is that Black Holes are thought to emit Hawking Radiation loosely in proportion to their size. 

Except backwards from what you’d expect, the giant monster sized ones in the centers of galaxies emit so little of it you’d need a trillion, trillion years to collect enough energy to turn on a little LED light for a fraction of a second. 

Alternatively the small ones gush out power so fast they burn out their tiny mass in very short times. 

There’s two upshots of this. 

First, that the lifespan of black holes is proportional to the cube of the mass, one twice as massive emits only a quarter of the power and lives eight times longer, one ten times as massive emits a hundredth of the power and lives a thousand times as long, etc. 

Second, if we can make artificial black holes, and especially if we can feed matter into them to replace what they lose to Hawking Radiation, we have an excellent power source for things. 

Black Holes are roughly on par with anti-matter, and vastly better than nuclear fission or fusion, in terms of energy per unit-mass of fuel, and they don’t blow up unless you starve them to death, a process that would take years or centuries normally, making them a very attractive option for power generation and storage. 

This is assuming we can figure out how to make small ones and feed them, both of which are actually a lot harder than with their bigger, naturally occurring kindred. 

Which again emit virtually no energy on timelines that can be measured without using scientific notation. 

This doesn’t mean we can’t tap black holes for power in other ways though. 

The preferred way to tap a black hole for power quickly, which also works on neutron stars, is to suck out their rotational energy. 

Stars spin, same as planets, they have a lot of angular momentum and that is one of those conserved quantities in nature. 

When they die and collapse they start spinning much faster for the same reason an ice skater twirling around with her arms out will spin much faster by just bringing her arms in toward her body. 

Our sun rotates around once a month, neutrons stars often rotate many times a second, that is why pulsars make such handy clocks. 

I was going to say pulsars are a type of neutron star but all neutron stars begin as pulsars, it’s just they have to be pointing in our direction for us to notice the pulsing and that effect diminishes with time. 

This isn’t a video on pulsars so I’ll just simplify it for the moment by saying they emit two narrow beams from opposite directions and if you’re at the right angle each of those beams will pass over you every time it spins around, which again is many times a second. 

They only do this for the first hundred or so million years of their life, and only about a tenth happen to line up with Earth so it is right to think of pulsars as a type of neutron star it’s just that the type is A) Fairly young and B) coincidentally aimed our way. 

Every neutron star was a pulsar for someone at some point. 

Science fiction loves to say you can use pulsars to get navigational fixes off of, and that’s basically true, but you’d need a catalog of all the young neutron stars to do that properly. 

And again it is only young neutrons stars you can use for this as they slowly lose energy and cool with time, something we’ll discuss a bit more in the second section of this video. 

Anyway needless to say black holes spin too, and very quickly, and both them and neutron stars emit huge magnetic fields as a result, same as Earth does from having a giant molten ball of spinning metal in the core. 

You can tap that power, sucking energy from spinning magnets was how the first electric generator worked, the Faraday Disc, which was the precursor of dynamos. 

The disc slowed down as it leaked power as electricity. 

Stealing away that black holes rotational energy, which is a large chunk of it’s total mass energy, is thus a pretty attractive option. 

And there’s various proposed ways of doing that. 

The Penrose process is probably the best known of them, and relies on being able to remove that energy because a black holes rotational energy is thought to be stored just outside the event horizon in what’s called the ergosphere. 

You obviously can’t dip under an event horizon and suck energy out, but we can from the ergosphere. 

There’s also the Blandford–Znajek process which is one of the lead candidates for explaining how quasars are powered. 

If you’re familiar with Quasars, and how they are brighter than most galaxies, this gives you an idea how much juice a black hole can provide. 

It also taps the Ergopshere for power and does it by using an accretion disc, so you’d use this on a black hole that already had one or that you were feeding, we’ll come back to that in a moment. 

You can also just dump matter into a black hole, it gains kinetic energy as it falls down, same as if we drop a rock off a tall building. 

If you tied a spool of thread to that rock and ran an axle through the spool attached to an electric generator you’d get electricity. 

And you could do the same with a black hole too. 

Of course if you drop that rock off the building you’d get less power than you’d expect because the rock is falling through air, slamming into air particles, and transferring much of its momentum to them, actually heating the air up in the process. 

This is how parachutes work, transferring all that kinetic energy into a wide swath of air as heat. 

It’s not a lot, but if the object is moving fast enough, like a spacecraft on re-entry, it’s a lot more and can make the object and the air it’s hitting so hot it will glow. 

You could gain some power with a solar panel that was nearby, drinking in that light. 

And you can do the same with a black hole because as matter falls towards them and often ends up in orbit around the black hole rather than directly entering, it forms what we call an accretion disk. 

And those glow quite brightly, giving off a lot of photons you can collect to use for power. 

If you dump matter into a black hole you can collect that power. 

It should be noted that when things approach large masses they usually don’t curve and slam down into them, and that’s as true for black holes as anything else. 

Their path curves, depending on how close they get and how massive they are. 

If they are very close to a very large mass they will hook right in, but normally they either fly off at a different angle or enter an orbit. 

And if there’s other stuff hanging around there for them to bump into their orbit will decay and they’ll eventually fall in. 

All that bumping, again, generates heat and if there’s enough heat, lots of visible light too, same as a red hot chunk of metal. 

That’s an accretion disc, for a black hole. 

And everything that falls into a black hole will add to its rotational energy too, though if it goes in backwards it will subtract from it. 

So if you’re dumping matter into black holes it pays to drop it in the right direction. 

Now neither the rock on a string or the solar panels collecting light off matter dumped into a black hole is terribly efficient as these things go, but they are a lot conceptually easier for some then the other methods I mentioned. 

Getting back to the Blandford–Znajek process, which I said was a prime candidate for how Quasars work and another black hole power method, and for our purposes it’s pretty similar to the penrose mechanism but happens to have an equation you can use to determine how much power you get out of the thing. 

They aren’t the same thing, and if you want to explore the difference I’ll attach a link in the video description to Serguei Komissarov’s 2008 paper that detailed the differences for those who are interested. 

That equation shows us that the power output of a black hole via this process goes with the square of the magnetic field strength of the accretion disc and the square of the Schwarzchild radius of the black hole, both of which will rise if we increase the size of that accretion disc or if we increase the mass of the black hole, and in nature bigger black holes usually have much larger accretion discs. 

Particularly the big ones near the center of galaxies, especially volatile young galaxies, as I mentioned this is usually considered a prime candidate for how quasars are powered and quasars frequently give off a hundred times the power of an entire regular galaxy. 

We would presumably want to tap that power a lot slower, using much smaller black holes and matter flow rates. 

Now any of the methods that involve extracting rotational energy will eventually cause that black hole to slow and finally stop rotating. 

At that point while you can still dump matter in, you won’t get nearly as a good a return, and the black holes mass will increase, making it live longer and give off less power via Hawking Radiation, which is the only option I’m familiar with that let’s you tap into the rest of that mass energy, as the black hole slowly evaporates. 

And we do want that energy. 

While lighter artificial black holes can emit useful sources of power via Hawking Radiation, the big massive ones essentially aren’t. 

Not unless you can build ridiculously sturdy equipment that can operate without wear or tear needing power or replacement matter to fix over even more ridiculously long periods of time. 

But we will have at least a hundred trillion years to get better at building sturdy material, and there aren’t many things around to cause external wear and tear by then, and it is the only game in town after you suck out the rotational energy and all the stars burn out, plus if you can do it there are some big potential advantages to waiting that long to pull out your energy, as we’ll discuss in part three. 

But first, let’s hit Part Two and review the Fate and Chronology of the Universe. 

Or I should say the primary current theory for a naturally aging and expanding universe. 

I mention that for two reasons. 

First that theory could be wrong, it probably is at least in part, or incomplete, and second because we don’t live in a universe that’s likely to continue along a natural path, because we live in it. 

Intelligent critters can change their environment after all, and generally tend to, and we’ve spent a lot of time on this channel talking about ways to tinker with planets, stars, and whole galaxies so it would seem silly to ignore how that could affect the progression of the Universe. 

So first we have the big bang, which doesn’t terribly interest us today, other than it being worth keeping in mind that the Universe began expanding then and continues to do so, and almost certainly has parts that are so far away from us that we will never detect any light from them since new space emerges between them and us faster than light can cover the distance. 

This effect will only get worse with time and eventually only the galaxies in our local area close enough to be bound to us by gravity will remain. 

As those galaxies get further away, and from all that emerging extra space seem to get further away faster and faster, the light from them red shifts and gets weaker and weaker. 

That’s not the only red-shifting light out there though, and there’s one type that is of great interest to us today for our final section. 

The Big Bang happened about 14 billion years ago, and just 400,000 years later an event called the last scattering took place. 

Not a long time, an eyeblink compared to the age of the Universe, but still a hundred times longer than recorded history and about the duration of human existence. 

The last scattering was an important event, and is aptly named. 

Up until then the universe was a much smaller and denser place. 

And small and dense means hot. 

Very hot, up until then the universe would have glowed like a star in every single direction you look, a big white haze. 

But the light emitted didn’t go far because it was too hot for atoms to form yet and it that pre-atomic plasma soup light scattered much easier. 

As the universe cooled down and suddenly atoms could form, and were further apart from expansion, photons could suddenly travel long distance without being likely to run into anything and that kept plummeting. 

Most photons will never run into anything now. 

As a result there are always photons left over from then still flying through space thus far uninterrupted in their journey. 

Now when they started off the spectrum was pretty similar to what stars emit, visible light, but over time as they’ve traveled, with new bits of space emerging along their path red-shifting them, they’ve lost power. 

They went through infrared and finally entered the microwave range just recently, this left over radiation that’s in the background of everything throughout the cosmos, is called cosmic microwave background radiation. 

As more time passes it will grow weaker and weaker and the universe will keep expanding and cooling. 

Eventually it will get so weak and cold that those bigger naturally occurring black holes will finally start giving off more Hawking Radiation then they absorb in background radiation and actually begin to slowly age. 

Right now all naturally occurring black holes are actually growing in mass, even if there’s no matter nearby to feed them. 

That time, when things are that cold, is a long, long way off. 

Before we get there we have our own sun slowly getting hotter until it eventually renders Earth uninhabitable and goes Red giant, swallowing Earth, then leaves behind a earth-sized dense corpse called a white dwarf, which generates no new energy from fusion but still gives off a lot of light compared to what our planet uses, and ought to still be warm enough to light many earths for even longer than its current remaining lifetime before going red giant. 

That’s our first example of a civilization at the end of time, because normally we figure it’s the end of the road when our star goes red giant, at least here on Earth, and sooner than that too because the Sun is heating up and Earth will probably be uninhabitable inside a billion years. 

Except it won’t be, because there are intelligent critters on it. 

We may come back and explore this idea in more detail in the future but for now I want to use it as our first example of how you can’t look at the timeline for the natural Universe as particularly likely. 

Not because the science is wrong but because it doesn’t contemplate the impact of us on that timeline. 

We’ve talked a lot about moving planets or shielding them from light to cool them down. 

We looked at that in the terraforming video and more recently in the Ecumenopolis video. 

So a billion years from now without intelligence Earth might be rendered uninhabitable by a sun growing hotter, but that probably won’t be how it goes down. 

We might sterilize our planet ourselves long before that, our track record when it comes to screwing up our planet on accident or blowing up chunks of it is not in my opinion quite as terrible as many naysayers think, but it certainly isn’t anything we’d want to brag about either. 

Or we might disassemble it for building material. 

In the megastructures series we’ve explored the basic idea that a planet, in terms of living area, is basically as efficient as mountain with a few caves on it is. 

You get a lot more space by disassembling that planet to build megastructures, in the same way you would disassembling a mountain and its few cramped caves to use the rock and metal to build skyscrapers. 

You could disassemble the average mountain, and it’s cramped few caves able to hold maybe a few hundred people, and build housing for the entire planet. 

Similarly you can disassemble a planet and reassemble it as megastructures with thousands or millions of times the living area. 

So we might do that and have no planet here in a billion years. 

Or we could shade the planet, putting a large thin shade between us and the sun, decreasing the light we got, especially the infrared range that’s pretty useless for plants, and keeping us from burning up. 

Or we could just move the planet outwards. 

Moving planets is pretty time consuming as we discussed in the Terraforming video but it is doable, requires no advanced technology, and we do have a billion years. 

So in a billion years it would seem very unlikely the world will die, because it either will have long before from us screwing up or using it for building material, or because we valued it a lot and decided to preserve it. 

And you can protect against red giant phase of a star and weather it and come back in to live around that white dwarf remnant for many billions of more years. 

Of course even thirty billion years from now when that white dwarf is too cold to be of any further use to us, a black dwarf, the Universe will still be quite young and going full tilt. 

Our galaxy will still be forming stars at the same rate as now, only a bit faster since we will have merged with the Andromeda galaxy by then and some of our other neighboring galaxies will have either merged in by then or be approaching. 

It won’t be for 800 billion years, about 200 times the age of Earth and 60 times the age of the Universe, and 200 million times the duration of recorded human history, before that star formation starts dying off, and it will be an estimated 100 trillion years before it ceases entirely. 

There are stars that live longer than a trillion years and will still be around when star formation begins to ebb off, and they are more efficient at burning their hydrogen into helium too, and we may look at some examples in the future of how creating stars or intentionally storing hydrogen in artificial gas giant or brown dwarfs might be used to similarly extend the lifespan of the star-forming age of the Universe. 

Or to create essentially compact dyson spheres of high-efficiency, ultra long lived stars in what’s been dubbed a ‘Red Globular Galaxy’, a sort of massive megastructure light years across that hangs on the edge of being a black hole even though it’s not very dense. 

To the best of my knowledge that’s the largest continuous megastructure you can build, though I might be biased on it since it was my brainchild. 

Still we get stars for 100 trillion years, and actually still some after that since even though the universe will be composed of nothing but brown dwarves, white dwarves, black dwarves, neutron stars, and black holes they will occasionally run into each other. 

And a white dwarf merging with a brown dwarf could form a new star as hydrogen is added to that stellar remnant, though if it is added to fast you get a Nova instead, a very common event in nature that never seems to get any mention compared to its more spectacular big brother the supernova. 

And the collision of dead stars is a common cause of supernovae. 

A whole lot of hydrogen hitting a white dwarf or a neutron star or two of them slamming into each other, is quite common, since many stars are binaries and the bigger of the pair will go red giant and expand to include its neighbor and cause that star’s orbit to decay, just like an accretion disc, until they run into each other. 

So it’s not just the explosion given off when a big star dies. 

Kinda like the misimpression that pulsars are a particular type of neutron star, I think popular science and science fiction has tended to make folks think supernova is synonymous with big giant star dying and nothing else. 

But that universe, at the 100 trillion year mark, will be pretty dark and cold, and just keep getting more so. 

By then the other galaxies will all have either folded into our own or fled over the cosmological event horizon never to be seen again long ago. 

We’ll still see light coming from them forever, but it will keep red shifting to be weaker and weaker. 

But we won’t be able to talk to them anymore or them talk to us, the signal lag will keep getting longer and longer until it becomes infinite, and that will happen a lot sooner than the stars burning out, indeed it’s pretty much constantly happening all the time. 

The Universe keep expanding in size but the Observable Universe, which also keeps expanding in size, is constantly hemorrhaging mass over the horizon. 

Most of the galaxies that aren’t close enough to us to be gravitationally bound but close enough to be reached without faster than light travel could conceivably be colonized over the billions and trillions of years to come, by us, or might host alien life forms we might exchange long, very delayed, cordial talk with. 

So I nickname this phase the ‘Long Good Bye’, because all the civilizations around will presumably be emitting their history and commentary on life constantly and one by one the furthest ones away will disappear, and you from them, and you’d know when it was coming so you could send out one last message to them. 

It probably would be cordial chat, and thus probably a sad goodbye, since if you haven’t invented some form of faster than light travel by then it’s not like you have anything to fight over since you can’t. 

I don’t think even the most determined warmonger will spend a billion years flying off to do war with someone. 

And it would seem if you haven’t figured out how to go faster than light by then, or beat entropy, that you might as well settle in for the end. 

Though as we’ll see it doesn’t have to be the end and the speed of light actually becomes an increasingly smaller hindrance as time rolls on, even though the Universe keeps getting bigger. 

So on to part three, black hole farming. 

The Universe is a hundred trillion years old, and now you are living on reserves of hydrogen you’ve collected to either run in artificial fusion reactors or make new stars from. 

Or to feed into dead stars for a bit more power as you collect their slowly decreasing heat and light. 

Or your artificial small black holes are running out of fuel if you’ve got them. 

Now you can tap all those black holes for their rotational energy and live on that for a good long time. 

You can slam dead stars together to make more and live on those too. 

But eventually they also run out of rotational energy. 

100 Trillion years is usually the timeframe given for the end of life, effectively the end of civilization. 

The point at which the handful of folks still remaining show up around the last star and have a party at the restaurant at the end of the Universe, but we could ration it out a lot longer using those techniques we’ve discussed thus far. 

You can even stick black holes near each other and suck power off their orbital decay and merger. 

It does eventually run out though. 

Now all that’s left is Hawking Radiation. 

And I’d have to conclude this pretty much has to be the end of biological life in favor of minds that simply exist on computers running in virtual landscapes. 

From a practical perspective this is probably irrelevant since you can still have all your planets and architecture and art and fashion and so on inside those virtual landscapes. 

We talked about this sort of concept in the Transhumanism and Immortality video and if the idea of living in a computer feels off to you it might be better to watch that now or when you’re done with this video. 

We used that to jump into the Doomsday Argument and Simulation Hypothesis videos too. 

In the context of the Doomsday Argument and Simulation Hypothesis as we’ll see in a bit when we examine the sheer immensity of these constructs in time, odds could be considered pretty good you and I are actually in one of these setups, running on computers around a black hole in a dark old universe and we just don’t know it because whoever put us in there, which might have been ourselves, found it depressing to think about how they were on a ticking clock edging toward infinity and it was evening not morning, so they erased their memory of that. 

We will see shortly that these post-stellar civilizations could actually be where the majority of living in this Universe occurs, with the stellar phase just being a quick bright blip against the sea of eternity, but even they run out of juice in the end and probably have to start sacking their stored memories to keep going just a while longer and it’s not hard to imagine the ones near the end might decide they’d be happier without being aware they were doing that and opt to replicate those last eras of Old Earth long gone but not forgotten. 

Anyway odds are good biological life is a long ago thing of the past, I mean it’s been trillions of years and as we saw in the Matrioshka Brains video and Existential Crisis Series, you can get a lot more thinking power out of digital people running on computers than on food and air. 

But you can also do two other things with such digital people. 

First you can slow down their sense of subjective time. 

We normally talk about speeding it up, just taking a whole brain emulation of a person and running them faster than normal so they might experience whole years in minutes, but when you’re low on power you can just slow everyone’s subjective time down instead. 

And there’s not much point in hanging around at real time to watch the Universe since its black and boring now. 

But there’s two reasons you might want to start that rationing of time and energy a lot sooner, that form the first upside of purely digital people. 

One is a touch mundane, if you’ve got the remnants of our galaxies and its neighbors hanging out around a few million black holes hundreds or thousands of light years apart from each other, messages take hundreds or thousands of years to get back and forth. 

If you’re running at one thousandth your normal speed, conserving power, those message takes only months or years to arrive, and if you’re running at a billionth your normal speed you could have a phone conversation with someone on the other side of the dead galaxy without noticing a time lag. 

So the speed of light is finally beat by simple irrelevancy. 

You can’t exceed it but it’s now so fast compared to your experience of time that it simply doesn’t matter. 

The other upside I mentioned in the Matrioshka Brains video, and relates to the Universe getting colder. 

Currently we use a lot of power to flip a bit, as it were, to perform one single calculation, and there’s a little bit of heat generated, or a little power expended, every time you do that. 

We try to get better and better at making that amount smaller and smaller, and we may one day even figure out how to make it zero, through reversible computing, though that would seem to violate thermodynamics at least if you were doing anything that might qualify as thinking with it. 

It can’t be ruled out as an option but we are bypassing reversible computing or any specific discussion of quantum computing today, too many topics, too little time. 

The current theoretical limit is the Landauer limit, and it is considered to be the absolute minimum energy needed to erase a bit of data, essentially your minimum unit of thought. 

It happens to be linear to temperature, so if you can get that to be the maximum on your computing you get more computing – more thinking and more lifetime – out of every joule of energy you have. 

So as the universe cools you still have the same energy or power available but you get more thinking for every joule, and this setups a very different scenario and dynamic for the end of the Universe, if this limit becomes the control factor on things. 

Right now you and I, as basically 100 watt space heaters, get 1 second of thought for one hundred joules of energy, or 10 milliseconds of thought per joule. 

In fact it’s a lot less than that since we basically use most of our planet, and its nearly 200 billion megawatts of solar illumination to support 7 billion people and would have a rough time doing more than 20 billion off that without using the methods we discussed in the Arcology and Ecumenpolis video. 

So in terms of sunlight converted to food converted to thought we use around 10 megawatts of power to produce a second of human thought and arguably a billion times more than that since Earth only absorbs about a billionth of the sun’s light. 

But as we saw in Matrioshka Brains you could run trillions of trillions of trillions of real time human brain emulations. 

We found in the Transhumanism and Simulation Hypothesis videos that you could run a million people real time off the same power needed to light a 100 watt light bulb, the same power as human emits in heat, at room temperature if you could do your calculations at the Landauer Limit. 

Pushing that down to the current temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, 100 times cooler, would let you run 100 million people on that same power, or one million people on a watt, and do that real time. 

But the Universe keeps getting colder, and as I mentioned those naturally occurring black holes don’t stop gaining mass and emitting real usable hawking radiation till the Universe gets colder than them. 

So what is the temperature of a black hole? 

A naturally occurring one? 

Well we usually say you need to be about three times more massive than our sun is for a neutron star to collapse into a black hole, or at least most natural black holes will be that massive or more so. 

And those black holes live more than 10^68 years, more than 10^54 times longer than the star-forming phase of the Universe. 

A billion-billion-billion-billion-billion-billion times longer. 

And there temperature is not much over a billionth of a kelvin, about 20 billionths. 

So when the Universe gets that cold they start aging because they finally aren’t getting energy in faster than out and when it get hair colder you can start tapping that power and you’re now getting a billion times more calculations out of every joule of energy you get then you did running at the current theoretical maximum. 

And it will keep getting colder and the bigger black holes won’t be available till then. 

But some weirder things probably happen at below 10^-18 Kelvin, like macroscopic teleportation of matter, and it is also thought that you can’t get colder than 10^-30 Kelvin, which is well below what even black holes consisting of several entire galaxies, presumably the maximum sized naturally occurring black hole, would need to reach before they started giving off more power than they received so for our example I will stop at 10^-18 Kelvin, where you can get a billion, billion times more calculations then you can squeeze out per joule now. 

It is more than enough to drive home the sheer enormity of these sorts of civilizations anyway. 

One person, digitized of course, could run on one millionth of a watt at the current minimum temperature meaning they could run at one millionth of a billionth of a billionth of a watt, or 10^-24 watts, at that 10^-18 Kelvin. 

Well time is an entirely subjective and relative thing at this point, so those 3 solar mass black holes still lying around are only giving you about 10^-29 Watts but that would let you run a person at 1/100,00th of real time, and a message sent a hundred thousand light years would only take a year to arrive form your perspective. 

Or let you run, say, a nice community of 10 million people at a trillionth of natural time, where a phone call across a hundred thousand light years would only take half a second to arrive and a full second for you to say something and hear their reply to it. 

Them being some other community of ten million living around another black hole. 

You could slow things down even more and have more people active, if you wanted and if you could keep your equipment running and practically access that ridiculously tiny power output in some fashion. 

I’ve no idea how you would do that but it’s not actually barred by any laws of physics to the best of my knowledge. 

Time might be running slow, but when your subjective time is all that matters who cares what the real time is passing at? 

Normally, without contemplating the Landuaer Limit, that perspective says you might as well run everybody really fast, because there’s only so much available energy in your chunk of the Universe and a lot of it is being lost to entropy every moment. 

So do your thinking now and get the most out of it, but in the context where we get more thinking from the same energy by waiting till things cool down, the dynamic changes completely. 

And even though you and your community of 10 million is only running at a trillionth of normal speed, or maybe a quadrillionth if you want an Earth sized population of ten billion, that is a subjective eternity still. 

Remember those 3 solar mass black holes lived more than 10^68 years. 

Scientific notation not being great for giving scale, even at a quadrillionth of normal speed to support 10 billion people, that’s 10^53 subjective years or 10^39 times as long as the 100 trillion year phase of the universe where there are stars, a thousand trillion-trillion-trillion times as long. 

I said way back in the redo of the Dyson Dilemma and Fermi Paradox Compendium, when I first decided to do this video, that we often see that period after the stars die out as the end off everything, an eternity of darkness, but in reality it would be pretty vibrant times. 

Most of the mass energy of the Universe will still be around when the stars die off and we’ll be reaping it billions of billions of times more efficiently, so you could have billions of billions times as many lifetimes in that dark phase after the stars than during it. 

And that’s what we’ve shown here. 

And if you have seen the Simulation Hypothesis video, contemplate that, or keep it in mind should you go watch or re-watch it. 

Because it not only adds massively to the sheer number of possible people involved it also adds us another motivation for doing such things. 

Nothing lasts forever and running super-intelligences is expensive, so near the end there could be a time where you’ve dumbed people back down to modern levels and traded your history and the matter and energy used to store it to buy more life and obscure that time is running down. 

I don’t want to focus on that aspect because it should just be a final tiny and somewhat depressing snippet of that very longed lived and enormous post-stellar civilization but I don’t want to bypass how that could alter our view of some of our previous topics either. 

Now it’s all very speculative, we may find better ways to power civilizations, that’s a long time to learn to beat entropy somehow, and it may be impossible to tap these powers sources practically to their full amount, but even the rotational energy methods we discussed earlier, if held off until those cold phases for tapping, will do pretty good. 

But the take away is that even as we’ve discussed before in the context of megastructures and interstellar colonization, that we are probably only the tiniest earliest fraction of humans around, the post-stellar civilizations at the end of time will overshadow even those we’ve previously discussed in sheer size and duration. 

They dwarf in every respect even the most extreme galaxy spanning Kardashev-3 civilizations we’ve contemplated before. 

Even factoring in subjective time slowing things millions or trillions of fold, the sheer number of people that can be supported this way, from the cooling of the Universe lowering the cost of calculations, simply crushes the entire stellar phase of the Universe into a tiny side note of civilization that is noteworthy only because it was early, same as those early civilizations in the Fertile Crescent remain important to us even though there are backwater towns by the tens of thousands that exceed the mighty cities of that time in numbers and totally eclipse them in effective power. 

These latter day civilizations in the cold universe, living off black holes and the other seeming remnants of a dead universe, turn out to be so immense in scope that they can’t be regarded as civilizations at the end of time, but rather the real civilization of which everything that came before was simply a quick prologue. 

And that’s Black Hole Farming, and they make for a pretty fertile farm after all. 

We may revisit some of the earlier stages, life around dying stars or some options for Galactic scale Megastructures in future videos. 

We might even take a peak at the idea of Boltzmann Brains, which can conceivably exist in defiance of entropy, but that finishes our look for today. 

In the meantime it’s back to the habitable planets series next week for a look at Panthallassic Planets, Worlds entirely covered in water, and what life might be like trying to evolve there or if we went to such a world to colonize it. 

The week after that we finally return to the Faster Than Light series to look at wormholes, where will discuss the theory, look at some of the problems with making them and how they could result in time travel causality loops, and also explore a lot of the overlooked uses of the things if they can be made to work like terraforming planets or serving as power plants or even refueling dying stars.

Ecumenopolises
---
  
2016-07-08  
https://youtu.be/XAJeYe-abUA  

---

So last week’s topic was arcologies, the concept of self-sufficient architecture, often envisioned as giant towers that are basically cities unto themselves complete with farms inside them. 

Today’s topic, Ecumenopolis, extends on this notion as the sort of ultimate Arcology, where an entire world has been transformed into one giant, planet-spanning city. 

We’ll look at what this concept means, where it came from, some of the fictional examples of it, and some of myths and misunderstandings about the concept. 

This is our second video looking at what I’ve dubbed Visions for Earth. 

On this channel, and in science fiction, we often spend so much time off the planet, out terraforming planets, looking at megastructures, or on interstellar colonization, that we often neglect what happens to Earth itself. 

In almost any discussion of the future, where Earth isn’t alone but just one of many places people live, it tends to take a backseat. 

If it gets any attention at all it tends to be either as some lost world humanity fled or as a capital of some interstellar empire where very little of interest goes on. 

So I thought it might be fun to spend some time looking at Earth. 

Now Ecumenopolises hardly have to be on Earth, so our concepts today aren’t Earth-centric, but today we’ll be exploring the notion of how you might go about transforming an entire planet into a city, how you stick the most people on it without turning the planet into some sort of Dystopian Cesspool, and we’ll take some shots at the idea that a planet can’t have lots of nice forests and natural spaces without not only keeping its population to modern levels but actually decreasing it. 

We’re also going to be looking out how a technologically robust civilization would fundamentally alter their planet in ways we wouldn’t tend to expect, and to do that we’ll be drawing on a lot of concepts we’ve discussed in the past. 

If you haven’t seen those in a while and need a refresher, or just haven’t seen them because you’re new to the channel, I will often bring up in-video links such as this one that you can just click on to pause this video and open that one up in a new window, so you can watch that and come back to this video when you’re done. 

And if you haven’t seen Arcologies yet, while it isn’t absolutely required for this video I would encourage you to watch that now and come back to this when you’re done. 

If you do happen to be new to this channel, I suggest you turn on the close captions too. 

Some folks find me hard to understand and the topics we discuss on this channel tend to be complicated enough on their own that we don’t need an additional hurdle of my speech impediment interfering in that. 

Also, this week we will be having a poll again for future topics, I’ll talk about that a bit more near the end but while the poll is active you should see a little marker in the upper right corner you can click on to bring up that poll and vote. 

Okay, intro complete, announcements complete, let’s dig in to today’s topic. 

The term Ecumenopolis was first coined in 1967, and like Arcologies it came up quite a while after the basic concept was first used. 

Besides the fact that the fellow who coined it was a Greek city planner, Constantinos Doxiadis, whose name I probably just mispronounced, we have tended to use Greek for a lot of the city related terms. 

Polis, meaning city, is regularly used in the word Metropolis, literally Mother City, and is the root word of policy, politician, and police for instance. 

Ecumene, literally “Inhabited”, was routinely used to mean the world and you’d probably best know it from the term Ecumenism, in regard to unifying churches. 

So there’s a bit of triple-dose on that for the term, since it is using the term in the world spanning context, the original one of inhabited, and the concept of merger and unification of cities into one big whole. 

The level below this but above metropolis is usually called a megalopolis, either a very big city of, as mega would imply, more than a million people, or a merger of various cities and suburbs into a bigger whole, such as the region stretching from Boston down to Washington DC, sometimes called the Northeast Megalopolis. 

There’s a lot of other polis terms, Cosmopolis, Astropolis, Necropolis, Acropolis etc but for our purposes today we’ll be just looking at it as stepping from Metropolis to Megalopolis to Ecumenopolis at the planetary level. 

But I’d say a solar-system wide equivalent, basically a Dyson Sphere or Swarm, a Kardashev-2 civilization, could maybe be deemed a Dysonopolis, Solopolis, or maybe Heliopolis if we wanted to stick to Greek, and a Kardashev or K-3 galactic equivalent could be a Galactopolis or maybe the aforementioned Astropolis. 

Now the basic concept is easy enough, a city sprawling over a whole planet, maybe up to and including the oceans and polar regions. 

I believe the first example of this in fiction was Isaac Asimov’s Galactic Empire Capital world of Trantor, from his classic Foundation Series but I could be wrong. 

Last week I credited the popularization of the term Arcology to the SimCity game franchise but we dug up an earlier reference in William Gibson’s Sprawl Trilogy right in the first book, Neuromancer, in 1984 which definitely predates that video game and as one of the cornerstone science fiction staples of the Cyberpunk Genre along with Blade Runner and Snow Crash is a lot more likely to have been the source that popularized the term. 

Still I’d say Asimov’s Trantor is the best known fictional example at least until the Star Wars prequel trilogy showed us the city-planet of Coruscant half a century later. 

Trantor showed up in a number of his works besides the Foundation Trilogy and he later slightly retconned many of them to weld them all together, and one of those, the almost equally famous Robots Series, in its first book the Caves of Steel, spends a lot of time in Megacities, the titular Caves of Steel, exploring a sort of precursor concept of Ecumenpolises and large arcologies. 

Amusingly, for an author who normally was very good with his math and science in his writing, those megacities, where every human on Earth lived, housed an unbelievably enormous 8 billion people, just a bit over our current total population, and Trantor, a city-planet described as having paved over everything including the oceans, and building many stories high, even miles high in the sky and underground, holds a whopping 40 billion people and had twenty planets in its neighborhood that did nothing but grow food for them. 

Bringing in food on enormous fleets of ships and bringing fertilizer back to those agriculture worlds. 

Needless to say, that’s all wrong, especially since access to nuclear fusion is explicitly mentioned in both book series, and we’ve talked a lot about how fusion is a gamechanger in terms of agricultural production. 

We also talked a lot about how robots are for both agriculture and construction and they obviously have those in the Robot Series, though how much they despise robots and don’t like using them is a pretty big theme in that. 

In that book, Caves of Steel, the protagonist does have an internal monologue about potentially transforming Earth into one single giant city. 

Now 40 billion is just ridiculously low, you can pull that off even without a super-power supply like fusion by just greenhousing over all your farmland, though doing so would mean a very large increase in overall maintenance cost and manpower unless you had robots. 

And incidentally when I refer to robots I’m not talking Asimov style androids I mean slightly more sophisticated versions of the entirely non-human type ones we employ in factories and these days even to mow lawns, vacuum floors, and clean pools. 

If you did pave over an entire planet like that, ocean and ice and all, even just one level high, you’d have 200 million square miles of area, or 5.5 quadrillion square feet or 500 trillion square meters. 

If we used our 10,000 square foot, or 1000 square meter, figure from last time for all the space one person needed for housing, food, recreation, work space, warehouses, and shared public areas, which we said at the time was meant to be very rounded up and generous, that one level high paved over planet would support half a trillion people. 

And in the case of Asimov’s Trantor, it is described as miles high and deep, or thousands of levels since you get about five hundred from one mile, and they imported their food too. 

So the 40 billion figure is just way off, other fictional Ecumenpolises like Coruscant from Star Wars and Terra from the Warhammer 40k fictional setting usually went for a trillion, or low trillions. 

But we just found you could rather generously portion every one 10,000 square feet, something like ten times bigger than a reasonably comfortable family apartment, and get half a trillion in one level. 

You do four miles up and down, about 2000 levels total, and you get a quadrillion people. 

And you could kick that up an order of magnitude or more just by building higher and not giving people quite so much personal space, and fictional examples usually do paint them as very cramped. 

Now we’ll see in a moment why space, even for growing food, isn’t the issue at all and why a quadrillion people just isn’t doable, because of heat, but let me tangent off onto scale in science fiction for a moment. 

It’s a standing joke and Trope that a lot of science fiction writers have no sense of scale, usually in terms of size or power or similar notions but population is always the one that bugs me personally. 

When looking at a setting I always try to assess it under what the fictional setting is giving us for technology, that’s a major aspect of the channel, we often explore seemingly crazy ideas and how they aren’t when grounded in reality under the specified assumptions. 

Science fiction, in particular the Space Opera genre, always seems to think a galaxy has a few thousand inhabited worlds sporting maybe a billion people each on average and tends to try to awe us with empires of trillions of people and armies of billions and fleets of thousands of ships. 

Star Trek tended to be the worst for this, a federation of hundreds of worlds and power sources that made fusion look weak and advantages like matter replicators and transporters yet for some reason they tended to have maybe one ship per planet with a crew of a few hundred or a thousand for maybe a whopping million personnel, on par or smaller than what most major nations here on Earth field, with only about a hundredth of our planet to supply that, not hundreds of planets. 

Interstellar empires ought to be able to throw millions if not billions of mile long ships into the field without even noticing the expense and their homeworlds could be pristine natural forests while those solar systems would not regard a trillion people as their population, but more akin to how many plumbers or painters or writers they had. 

That said, the quadrillion plus population on a planet isn’t viable, not because they don’t have enough space, but because if they don’t have some novel way to get rid of heat, even if the only heat being emitted was by people’s bodies because everything else was done off world or was super-efficient, people are basically 100 Watt space heaters. 

A quadrillion of us, 10 to the 15th, would emit 10 to 17th watts of power and that’s basically what the planet absorbs from the sun, and you need to scale that up by about a factor of 100 at least if you want to feed them food you grew there on the planet, because even the super-efficient kind of hydroponics we’ve discussed in the past is still only about 1% efficient at turning electricity and light into food calories. 

If you’ve got to get rid of 100 times the normal heat our planet receives, using the blackbody thermal radiation we’ve discussed in the past a lot too, mostly recently in the Matrioshka Brain video, your planet’s temperature increases three-fold, and that’s in absolute temperature, Kelvin, and would be hotter than Venus or Mercury. 

Just doubling a planet’s heat output would raise the temperature almost 20%, which would be about 150 degrees Fahrenheit or 66 Celsius. 

So even if we blocked off the sun, or at least the infrared radiation from it, which does us no good except to heat the planet, and even if we used all sorts of tricks like giant radiating fins and antennas, which will talk about in a bit, unless you’ve got some special trick for getting rid of heat you’re going to roast everyone alive long before you’ve got to worry about living space or food. 

And before you think we could just deliver food grown elsewhere without building up heat, you know import everything down space elevators, that doesn’t really work either. 

Objects gain kinetic energy as they come down to the planet, same as you have to give them a lot to get off the planet. 

A pound of bacon imported from the lunar hog farms and rich in fatty goodness has 2500 calories, which in terms of joules is a million. 

You want to move a pound of mass down from low earth orbit it’s going to gain over a million joules of energy which all has to end up a heat at some point. 

So while you can have more people if you’re importing everything you still have more heat being built up, and you still get problem even if you’re importing everything frozen or trying to bring down big blocks of ice from space. 

Now if you did have some super-science trick for heat, the sky’s the limit, quite literally, since you can just build until you’ve encompassed the whole atmosphere and keep going. 

At that point there’s no real point in thinking of it as floor area anymore, just volume, and 10,000 square feet a person easily becomes 100,000 cubic feet. 

Which would give you something like 4 times 10 to the 18 or 4000 quadrillion or 4 quintillion people. 

And if you’ve got stuff like wormholes or teleportation to get rid of your heat and artificial gravity or anti-gravity to keep things form collapsing, which they do in Star Trek and most scifi settings, you could do stuff like that. 

We’ll assume we don’t, and just keep it to realm where nuclear fusion is available and we’ve got robots that aren’t human level intelligence but can do a lot of grunt work like constructing buildings under supervision or water gardens and harvesting crops with minimal oversight. 

We might never get those but they tend to both be considered by a lot of futurists and scientists to be things we probably ought to have before the end of the century and maybe before another generation has passed. 

On the grand planetary scale though, if we have significant off world industry, fusion isn’t strictly necessary and there are some disadvantages to it, since while power plants down on Earth could churn out the power for optimized LED lighting of plants those reactors are still going to be generating tons of waste heat while making that power. 

If your goal is to minimize heat on a planet by, for instance, using glass out at our Lagrange point to intercept infrared light but let visible light through, you might be better off using huge arrays of tinted lenses and mirrors to beam that same photosynthesis optimized light down to Earth where the useless frequencies were just not sent on. 

Similarly if you’ve got decently cheap and sturdy superconductors you might want all your power production done off world where you can get rid of that heat a lot easier, either as fusion reactor or solar panels. 

Superconductors let you move power over basically any distance without the loss of power to heat that normal conductors give us, and there is a concept called a thermal superconductor that lets you move heat by conduction that would also be invaluable for cooling, we won’t go into it now other than to mention that the availability and specific properties of such materials would probably have a huge impact on Ecumenopolis design and maximums. 

So fusion, while incredibly helpful, isn’t absolutely necessary for this sort of setup we’re discussing and indeed there would be some pros and cons in contrast to alternatives. 

I sometimes get accused of being overly focused on fusion, which I regard like someone in the 19th century telling someone they were overly focused on internal combustion engines, but the point is cheap power in massive quantities and fusion is the best candidate for giving us that on the horizon. 

Get yourself the ability to convert matter straight into energy, or to make wormholes so you can just dump one end right into a star, or grey goo nano-robots who can transmute an entire asteroid into a planet sized solar panel overnight, and those are better power sources. 

And since in this context I actually mean human power sources mostly, being food, those same nano-robots might be able to just transmute rock right into bacon-double-cheeseburger with way less power than growing one would take, or people might be all cyborg or post-biological and not even need much or any normal food. 

We work inside the context of the technology’s we think plausible, for today that’s fusion and reasonably smart but not human-smart robots helping regular old humans grow their food and construct their buildings. 

Okay, so in that context, assuming we could get away with maybe adding 50% to the heat we need to purge off our planet, either because we’ve done some tricks to help us radiate away heat or blocked some of the useless infrared from the sun, and that we only need maybe 10,000 watts of power per person for all our food and industrial and recreational needs, that would give us a budget of 10 to the 17 watts divided by 10,000 watts per person or 10 to the 13, which is 10 trillion. 

That’s way closer to the trillion or so seen in more modern fictional portrayals of Ecumenpolises, and is a good round figure. 

So let’s just say 10 trillion is the upper cap for people on Earth. 

A bit over a thousand times our current population. 

Last time we threw together an example Arcology big enough to grow all the food for 5000 people and leave them lots of personal space, and it was only a hundred stories high and 400 feet in radius. 

As I said then you could build taller or wider and we were pretty generous giving everyone 10,000 square feet, though that figure included all their hydroponics, shared public spaces, parks, warehouses, stores, and so on. 

If we just used those, to fit 10 trillion people, we need 2 billion of them. 

Could we even fit that on Earth or do we need to go taller? 

Well let’s run the numbers. 

Earth’s surface area is just under 200 million square miles, land, sea, everything, and conveniently we’ve got 2 billion of these arcologies, almost like I originally cherry-picked 5000 people to make the math easy, so ten per square mile. 

These things happened to have half a million square feet of area per floor, their footprint on the ground, so we’d need 10 times that, five million square feet given over to them on each square mile, and a square miles has 28 million square feet, so only 17% of area is actually taken up by them. 

If we only wanted a trillion people, you’d conveniently only need one Arcology per square mile taking up only 1.7% of that square mile. 

4 or 5 times as dense if you want to leave the ocean unused and the coldest parts of the polar regions. 

Of course we could easily double their height, ours were 100 stories high but we already have a couple dozen buildings nowadays about that tall or taller. 

We can definitely go taller, we can also go lower, as in underground, since most of the space in the arcologies is not actual residential living space where people would get touchy without windows. 

Heck if you want to go for mile high towers that gives you 500 floors, not 100, and since the air is still quite dense enough to breath a mile high you could still have balconies if you wanted and even some sort of pyramid or tiered cone set up that was much wider on the bottom and still have tons of space left over. 

If you wanted to go with arcologies that were skinny needles jutting all the way up to the top of the atmosphere maybe with space elevators extending from them or connecting up to an orbital ring like discussed in that same video way back at the beginning of the megastructures series, you could do that too and very conveniently hook yourself up to space. 

And we’ll talk about space more, outer space, in a moment. 

Talking about space, as in space per person, what we’re seeing is there is plenty, once we go vertical. 

If I dropped 10 trillion people down on this planet, and only in the places where they wouldn’t drown or freeze to death, everybody would only have about a 10 foot square to themselves. 

And that is very like the super-cramped megalopolises or ecumenopolises fictions usually shows us, but they always show those with a very vertical component and there is none in this 10 foot by 10 foot box we just drew, the size of a decent bedroom. 

I think that’s why I beat on this dead horse a lot, about population density, because we’ve known how big the planet was since long before we had science fiction and we haven’t done any complex math here. 

Just straight arithmetic. 

Ya know we see the same cramped, submarine like quarters on spaceships a lot in science fiction where you’ve got ships miles long with crews of maybe a thousand, but when you run the numbers on a lot of these ships, even if you assume they only give over 1% of the ship to crew accommodations, your junior personnel shouldn’t be sleeping 4 to a room, they ought to have closets that size. 

And the power outputs needed for ships like that just to wander around solar systems, forgetting all the Faster than Light stuff, as we saw in the interstellar colonization and black hole starships videos, tend to be enough to power entire planetary economies all on their own. 

Science Fiction can still be good even when the science and scale is all messed up but whole plots or concepts like crews being low on food or freezing or asphyxiating in ten minutes when the power goes off or not having enough water for showers are just kind a ludicrous when they’ve got huge ships like that with massive power supplies outright described as fusion or matter-anti-matter reactors. 

It’s like an entire story revolving around how poor and cash strapped the protagonist is while they’re walking around covered in solid gold chains carrying a briefcase crammed full of hundred dollar bills while sorting their loose change to buy a cup of coffee. 

Portrayals of Ecumenpolises tend to be about the same way for me, because they get described as so huge in terms of sheer space then someone goes and puts a population figure on it and you realize that if that was the case, 40 billion people on a planet hundreds of levels deep from land to pole to ocean, if they were evenly distributed everybody would feel like they were blundering around an empty skyscraper all by themselves, and if someone flicked the lights on in every room on the planet they’d all catch fire and melt soon thereafter. 

If you pave over and multi-layer a planet like that it’s just because you want a lot of space, and you like your space more than efficiency so maybe you’re making each floor a couple hundred feet high so you can replicate forests or tundras or lake or deserts and you carefully light them with a heat-efficient blend of artificial sunlight. 

You can squeeze out mother nature so it’s nothing but people, our pets, our parasites, and our provisions, but again you can outright double and then some your available sunlit land by just removing the infrared light from the sun from our solar budget. 

So you just build one layer above the other, artificially light the one and use it for people. 

And that’s without doing any other spectrum tricks like only using photosynthetic frequencies of light in most places and trimming back the lighting level to the minimum to maintain that ecosystem. 

Of course everybody could live only inside a few towers linked up to space stations or in space stations, we’ve spent a lot of time talking about that on this channel, rotating habitats, and that helps a lot with the heat issue to. 

Though it might be better in many cases to be putting your nature preserve in those space stations since you can make them quite larger and seal them of very easily from reckless humans or invasive species. 

But I’d argue all those space stations near a planet, all those orbital rings or space elevators or skyhooks, basically still remain part of that planet and part of that Ecumenopolis. 

I mean if you’ve got an orbital ring hanging a hundred miles over the planet that’s a lot easier to get too then the other side of the planet by flying. 

As I mentioned back then if you had one of those, or several, while they’re very wonderful for launching or receiving space ships they’d probably get used even more for rapid transport around the planet because without air drag and friction it takes virtually no energy to get up to very high speeds. 

You can also potentially dump heat that way too, not infinite amounts of it but it’s a lot easier to radiate heat when you’re using non-flat surface up in space than when you’re trying to purge it of the surface of a basically smooth sphere with a thick layer of infrared absorptive atmosphere over it. 

You get the equivalent of a thermal superconductor, and you can lift a lot of your heat away for easier dispersal up in space. 

And once you have stuff like space elevators or orbital rings in place, it is just about as easy and cheap to build an Arcology in low orbit, or high orbit, as on the ground, and you don’t have to worry about its heat very much. 

And you could build a whole swarm of these things around your planet like a mini dyson swarm without even denting the material available on Earth or the Moon. 

I usually call this the Terran Cloud, or when I’m generalizing and avoiding the accursed letter R, a planet cloud. 

Sort of a big brother of the Ecumenopolis and probably a more realistic scenario too. 

You could run something like this entire on sunlight, so it’s an option if you never get fusion. 

In that sort of setup your effective land area for people and critters is basically whatever the surface area of a sphere the same size as it would be, and you hardly have to stop such a cloud at geosynchronous orbital distance, or even way out at the moon, but for comparison a swarm that occupied the space out to geosynch could have as much as fifty time’s the Earth energy and heat budget and one out to the moon could have about 4000 times that. 

And then you really can cram quadrillions of people, or tens of quadrillions, into your super-city or Planet Cloud while still leaving a good dozen Earth’s worth of living area and habitat over to the equivalent of total nature preserves. 

So if you wanted to blow something like an entire continent over to just being protected habitats of various extinct ice age critters you’d grabbed the DNA for and cloned, you could do that for a chunk of your budget comparable to what a city spends on a zoo, and you can obviously tailor that climate perfectly and keep out problems that might disrupt it. 

I don’t particularly think our descendants would be trying to devote giant portions of their space and economy to preserving Earth’s native Flora and Fauna, or that would be their big focus in constructing these sorts of things, but I like to point out options like this because when you start talking high-tech civilizations, especially high population ones, lots of people tend to picture endless tree stumps or concrete parking lots and thinking every species will go extinct. 

Extinction is bad, and we should do what we can to prevent that, but it is worth mentioning that we already have the technology to read a critters DNA into digital format and print DNA, even if we didn’t have frozen sperm and embryos, let alone surviving members of that species. 

I really don’t like to say anything that might encourage folks to be reckless with our environment but I also don’t like to obscure plausible possibilities and solutions, and I would seriously doubt anything that’s gone extinct in recent years will stay that way, even if our civilization ends up in one of those concrete dystopian hellholes we just got done showing weren’t very realistic. 

It’s just not that hard to keep huge banks of frozen sperm and eggs or tissue or outright digital copies of DNA lying around. 

It took us a decade and a few billion dollars to sequence the human genome, now it takes a few days and a few thousand bucks. 

We usually put the total number of species in the low millions, at a few thousand bucks a piece, a number likely to drop further, that’s low billions and pretty affordable. 

Keeping them on ice too isn’t terribly expensive in space or energy either. 

DNA doesn’t take up much space, the Smithsonian’s bio-repository isn’t much bigger than a house and has room for 4 million vials all on its own, and that’s one of things that gets a lot cheaper when you build it bigger. 

Nor would minor damage or data loss be the end of things, besides keeping redundant copies DNA is a blueprint, you can guess what a damaged or missing bit was supposed to say and being wrong usually won’t matter too much, those sorts of minor errors happen routinely when your DNA replicates or you have kids. 

I hate to bring that option up because it’s very off subject and it should never be necessary, we can be better stewards of our planet than that, but I find that Ecumenopolises much like conversations of human immortality tend to make a lot of folks flinch away from them, and while for the latter, people will handwave at the notion that very long lives would be boring and undesirable, for Ecumenopolises the Handwaves to dismiss the idea are quality of life, what we’d do with all those people, and what havoc it would do to mother nature. 

I can understand the first and third one there, quality of life and fears for the environment, that’s why I spend so much time on this subject and arcologies talking about how luxurious and spacious and ecologically sound such things could be. 

That middle one, what we’d do with all those people, much like when folks suggest we have too many people, is one of those responses that I never really understand how to reply to. 

I can certainly understand why someone might think having more of us could be a bad thing if it meant we needed to plow every forest under for farms and couldn’t have any luxuries, but all things being equal more people is good and I would tend to regard that as a self-evident truth. 

Which is to say, one that does not require proof or discussion. 

I’ve made that point before in conversations about the Fermi Paradox, that life, especially intelligent life, is probably considered more valuable to most intelligent species than inanimate asteroids and dead planets so that I’d have a hard time imagining why they wouldn’t try to turn those things into habitats for life, but for some folks that doesn’t seem to click and I’m never sure why. 

Maybe they’re right, but I’ve never had a conversation with a chunk of rock where it laid out its reasoning for its inherent value, I suppose if it did I might change my mind but until then I’ll keep to my stance on the matter. 

If anyone’s had a nice chat with a rock saying otherwise maybe you can explain it to me, though I’d probably want to check your blood alcohol level or do a drug test on you first, no offense. 

Back to the space angle of things. 

Outer space not living space. 

We often see these world cities with many ships in orbit or landing or leaving or figure folks and freight go up and down in space elevators. 

Which is as it should be but, keeping in mind the elevator conundrum we mentioned last time, how much traffic is that? 

I mean a Ecumneopolis, we think of that as this big planet of planets, the capital, a place with probably a lot of tourism and trade. 

You look at the tourism figures for a lot of our great cities, just the tourism, and usually it is in excess of the total population. 

So I don’t think we’d be excessive, and honestly rather conservative, to imagine that a Ecumenpolis might process ten trillion visitors a year, and to assume a like amount of trade goods and personal baggage made the trip. 

But call it ten trillion people or a trillions tons. 

There’s about half a million minutes in a year, or 20 million people every minute, 40 since they have to come and go. 

40 million people checking through your spaceports, coming or going, every minute, nearly a million a second. 

You’d be processing the entire current human population going each direction every work shift, and who knows how much baggage or trade goods. 

When we think about building space elevators, when we talk about them in science fiction and how a planet has one, we usually don’t think of those embarking a passenger every second. 

So you are going to need a lot of them, whether we are talking the classic space elevator or just a hundred mile long one up to an orbital ring. 

You might even need one for every Arcology, especially since as I mentioned a lot of folks would use such a thing for travel around the planet. 

As I mentioned way back in Megastructures Episode one, you don’t need those tether to only be at the equator or run straight up vertically, so long as you’ve got multiple ones connecting from different directions to cancel out any lateral forces, nor do orbital rings need to be around the equator. 

It would depend more on just how much throughput you needed, which we can’t really predict. 

One school of thought says humans, assuming we haven’t gone all cyborg or post-biological in the future, which would seriously increase the total population a planet could handle too, would pack pretty light because mass is always an issue in travel and if you’ve got really excellent automation and 3D printing they could get almost everything they needed when they arrived and leave it to be recycled when they left. 

Ditto the good people of Earth might not put much value on where an item was made or grown because we can make identical versions anywhere so the Lunar Hog Farms might not have any market off world to sell their bacon. 

Alternatively in a post-scarcity kind of society people might be even more prone to liking foreign goods seemingly because they’re foreign and a lot of folks don’t like the vat grown bacon of their home Arcology, because it’s so mundane and was never a part of genuine pig and the Lunar Hog Farms are in business and so are the huge greenhouse habitats floating around the Lagrange Points shipping in wheat grown under the genuine honest to goodness real sun. 

And discerning people only drink bottled water straight from icy rings of Saturn, where no living creature has ever drank it before. 

Trying to predict people’s tastes in stuff, especially luxury items, is virtually impossible even a year or two in advance so I won’t bother trying for centuries ahead in time. 

But even if we assumed it was just those tourists, that’s a lot of ship docking and leaving every day too. 

You think of that classic spaceship with hundreds or maybe a thousand or so people on board and you’ve got several thousand of them arriving and leaving every second too, and since they’d probably be spending at least an hour or so docked or accelerating or decelerating to arrive or leave, you’d be talking about several million ships hanging around the general area at any given time. 

Way, way more if we’re talking about that Planet Cloud mini-dyson enveloping the general area. 

I was making grumpy statements early about how a lot of scifi setting seemed to have relatively tiny fleets and this is why. 

It takes a lot of tonnage to service a planet like this even if they don’t do much importing and exporting and even the kinds of giant armadas that used to be limited to books only but that CGI lets us do on TV and in film nowadays would get swallowed up in that sort of traffic like they were insignificant specks. 

It always comes back to scale, and it all does seem pretty ridiculous and overwhelming but as I mentioned earlier, we keep ourselves grounded in reality under the specified assumptions. 

All we did today was look at those options, assign them numbers, and do the arithmetic. 

Things change a lot when you actually plug in the numbers and they can come out unbelievably huge, but they’re unbelievable because we’re having difficulty absorbing their sheer scope and immensity, not because our reasoning and logic was bad. 

So we’ve got this notion then of the Ecumenpolis, the world-spanning city, and we see now that it doesn’t quite pass muster when inspected in the traditional form. 

It’s not that we can’t pack trillions of people on a planet, if we’ve got fusion or can beam power down from solar satellites, it’s that unless we can deal with the heat produced in using all that power we can never actually have that many people all tightly packed as those representations tend to imply. 

In the end our Ecumenopolises had way more people than they are usually said to have when people put numbers on it, yet at the same time had way more space to themselves. 

And we also see the planet doesn’t end at the surface, you can dig your arcologies down deep, or do whole layers separated by hundreds of feet, or float them on oceans or stick them down in oceanic trenches. 

Or you can keep building them up and directly attach them to space stations and how those space stations in many ways could be an integral part of that planet or even where the supermajority of the human population, or even the critters, make their homes. 

This is of course just one possible vision for how things on Earth could develop, and if there’s interest we may come back and look at some more in the future. 

But we’ve a lot of other subjects to cover first and some I’ve been putting off for too long. 

Next week is our black hole farming video, which will either be our first look at civilizations at the end of time or our entire look, depending on how much I can cut the script down. 

Big long topic. 

So it might be one video or might need to be broken up like we did with Arcologies and Ecumenpolises. 

I don’t know if it should be one video, maybe two, or a short series, if that last Black Hole Farming would be episode 1 of the series on the civilizations at the end of time. 

Every time I think I’m running low on material discuss I seem to end up with some new topic that when I’m done with it feels like it should have been three or four videos instead of the one I ended up making. 

We have a poll this week to decide what comes after that, and it is past time we got back to the Faster Than Light series and Habitable Planets series for our look at Wormholes and Ocean Planets. 

I have a suspicion both series will go on long hiatus after that, we’ve so much other material to cover and those haven’t generated as much interest as other topics so I’d rather continue on with those topics or new one. 

I’ve also been getting asked regularly to discuss KIC 8462852, also known as Tabby’s Star, for around a year now and got asked three separate times just today as I was redrafting this script so I’m giving in and putting it up as an option. 

You can click on the poll to vote if you haven’t already. 

No channel update this time, various previously mentioned things are still ticking along and I want them in place before I launch any other channel additions. 

Though as always suggestions remain welcome. 

Ideas for the channel, topics for videos, questions about today’s subject, and general comments are always welcome and I encourage everyone to flick through the comments where people often do ask a lot of novel questions and I try to reply to as many as I can and encourage folks to try to answer any questions they can too. 

If you enjoyed the video, hit the like button and subscribe to the channel for alerts when new videos come out. 

You can also share the video with others and help support the channel on Patreon. 

Sometime in the next month or so we’ll hold our first raffle for the channel patrons to let the winner pick a subject for a video too. 

In the meantime feel free to watch any of these other video series on the channel, and since I seem to get asked a lot what this or that song was in the background, let me just note that I do always include the music in chronological order during the credits. 

Again next week is Black Hole Farming and until then, have a great day and we’ll see you next time!

Arcologies

Arcologies Today will be looking at Arcologies, a sort of mix of skyscraper and self-sufficient habitat. 

And will be exploring this idea, where it came from, and what it implies for human civilization. 

The first thing to understand is that Arcology has essentially developed two different meanings. 

The original one, where the name derived from, was essentially the idea of self-contained ecologically sustainable communities. 

The word Arcology is a portmanteau of the words Architecture and Ecology and that accurately describes the original intent. 

In this context there’s no special implication of it being a single giant building, though it wasn’t unusual for it be a community under a dome, or linked together. 

There’s no need for such communities to be isolated from trade but the assumption is they are designed to be at least minimally self-sufficient in terms of things like food, in contrast to a classic cities or castles that certainly didn’t grow their own food on site. 

The concept of a single massive building is the more modern notion, and as best as I can tell the enormous skyscraper approach was popularized by the classic game SimCity 2000. 

This portrayal almost inevitably shows the tower back-dropped against a major metropolis where it is being contrasted against it by its sheer size and usually a lot of plants and greenery in evidence, though it tends to imply that if that greenery is the real food source for the inhabitants the artist has wildly inaccurate notions of how much space growing foods takes. 

Traditionally an acre could feed a single person, though just barely, but modern farming does about an order of magnitude better, and climate controlled greenhouses doing hydroponics especially if you can do layered setups supplemented with red light, which is the primary one used for photosynthesis, can bump that up another order of magnitude. 

So it is actually conceivable to grow enough food for one person on the equivalent space of one large apartment or the basement of a house. 

But most apartments of that size have more than one occupant, and obviously you can’t use that space for living in and dedicated growth, particularly if you’re optimizing your growing space with red light, carbon dioxide, and heightened heat and humidity. 

Also skyscrapers cost something like $1000 a square foot, meaning your growing space for one person would cost something like a million dollars. 

Nor would this include much excess food, feed for meat animals, or for non-food elements like cotton for textiles, wood for lumber, or biofuels for fuel or plastics. 

We’ve played with these numbers before in the fusion video and some of our looks at space habitats and ships and I’ve usually found that a value of about 2000 square feet or 200 square meters is a pretty decent size with lots of padding and rounding up. 

Keep that number, rounded and somewhat arbitrary that it is, in mind for later. 

Most Arcology art that I’ve seen seems to just have the walls covered with plants and maybe some more inside getting non-optimal lighting. 

And the image those tend to paint, to me anyway, is essentially an over-sized building with houseplants and gardens, which is hardly revolutionary. 

Our cities have featured plants for as long as we’ve had cities and keeping a small herb garden out back, on a windowsill, or on your roof was a classic way of slightly supplementing your diet or improving the taste of your meals while helping to mask all the odors associated to human habitation especially prior to the invention of modern plumbing and sanitation. 

There’s nothing terribly revolutionary about growing plants in or around buildings, but if you actually want to feed the inhabitants primarily off those you not only need a lot more space devoted to it but to adopt some pretty intensive measures to get those yields, as I just mentioned. 

I’ve never really considered either vision of Arcologies terribly accurate though, and I thought the cover art was a lot more accurate to the real concept. 

This is the first time I’ve ever had the cover to a video on hand during the writing phase of a video, usually all the art comes well after the scripts are done so it’s nice to have one on hand while I’m writing for a change, admittedly this is script draft #5 at the moment, but I was especially taken with the cover Jakub designed since it nailed the concept on the head so much better than most representations I’ve seen. 

Out goes the contrast to existing metropolises, where every effort is made to show how immense these structures are, and we’re not impressed by that scale anyway since the megastructures series has shown us constructs so large even the smallest of them next to a giant stadium would look like a rolling pin next to a peanut. 

In comes the more proper image of giant buildings integrated into a more natural setting but one with mankind’s handprint on it in the forms of the hexagonal grid below. 

Arcologies are supposed to replace cities, so while you would expect early ones to sit next to a cityscape that portrayal shows us arcologies the same way sticking a model-T next to a bunch of horse drawn carriages show us a modern cars and roads. 

This video is essentially a two parter with next week’s video looking at the notion of the entire planet being subsumed into one immense city and I’m forever trying to explain that the sort of dystopian, packed concrete forest shown to us in most examples of that is just off the mark. 

Later in the video we’ll walk through an example Arcology only about as tall a tallest skyscrapers nowadays and not all that wide and we’ll see how just having one these poking out of the forests every couple miles would let you easily house dozens of times our currently population, and see that heat not space is the real bottleneck to further growth. 

So this image of them towering on their own or in small clusters scattered throughout forest and farmland is far more accurate. 

Now this doesn’t mean an Arcology can’t have all its food production done inside instead, but to do that you almost have to have fusion and ultra-cheap, ultra-durable construction in terms of height too, and we need to talk a bit about Vertical Farming to explain that. 

Vertical Farming has become quite a craze in recent years and I say craze with the full derogatory intent because it never makes any sort of economic sense to have your food supply, which takes a lot of space, grown inside skyscrapers, which often cost thousands of times more per foot of area than farmland does, and which really has few advantages economically or ecologically if you’ve got to run yourself on fossils fuels or solar power. 

In the absence of fusion, to light an acre of farmland up with replicated sunlight is going to require a few million watts of electricity running for a couple thousand hours a crop, so that even if you’re very miserly and efficient with your power supply you are burning millions of kilowatt-hours, and hundreds of thousands of dollars, to light up one acre per crop yield. 

It’s only when you have an actual alternative to sunlight that this becomes viable. 

And just as reminder, if you’re in doors right now with light coming in through the window or from a light bulb, it’s not half as bright as the noon time sun, it’s more like a hundredth or a thousandth. 

The noon time sun is about 100 Watts per square foot, a 100 Watts light bulb usually only produces about 10 Watts of visible light, and that’s being spread over a hundred or more square feet of floor and wall. 

The only reason LED lights, which produce strictly in the visible range, are even vaguely viable is that the super-majority of the sun’s light is not usable in photosynthesis, whereas LEDs can be tailored to emit a matching spectrum, and that plant’s can’t use most of the noon time sun light. 

So with LEDs you don’t need 100 Watts of sunlight per square foot and can get the same effect from maybe 5 watts of tailored light instead, less in most cases. 

That’s still prohibitively expensive, without fusion, but it also means you can light up a whole planet’s worth of surface area inside buildings without roasting the planet since you’re only adding 5% more heat to the setup, and we’ve discussed before some way of cooling planets and will look at that more in the follow up video. 

So that whole equation changes if you’ve got fusion. 

When you can exactly control the amount of and frequency of light and you control humidity, temperature, nutrient supply, the works, you can squeeze a lot of food out of an area and to the point that a large basement could produce the food for an entire family living in that house. 

Cheap, sustainable power is a huge game changer, but so is ultra-cheap construction and automation. 

In that sort of context a micro-arcology, a cabin in the woods, on first glance could look like any other, only you’d be surprised how lush and dense that forest was, and down in the basement there’s a couple level of hydroponics growing food and at night time little robots scurry out quietly to fertilize and tend to the forest, to harvest a bit of biomass, to water things, and so on. 

The notion of polyculture, which is mixing crops to optimize yields, is not very cost efficient currently because it can be pretty manpower intensive. 

Like with fusion, the equation changes when you’ve got better robots. 

The big green grass lawn that is a staple of suburban America is a staple because its not very time consuming compared to elaborate gardens. 

We already see robots replacing lawn mowers and vacuums, when you’ve got robots cheap and sophisticated enough to scuttle around on orders from your house computer pruning trees and watering and weeding gardens you would expect to see that replace the green lawn setup because it’s just an initial capital outlay plus the occasional maintenance or replacement of robot when your dog or cat mauls it, and you’d see a lot more fresh produce being homegrown when they can just scuttle in from your garden or greenhouse and stick the stuff in the fridge. 

This is every bit as much Arcology as giant towers are. 

So arcologies as a concept is just self-contained, self-supporting habitats. 

That could include everything from domed cities on the Moon or Mars or the giant rotating habitats we’ve previously discussed, to tower buildings where everything is grown inside, all the way down to a small cabin in the woods. 

They needn’t be isolated from trade but the notion is minimalist, because you’re trying to do most of your consumption from local production. 

But the giant building, if you do have fusion, can be one where everything is done not just nearby but totally inside the structure. 

Such structures could extend deep underground and high up into the air, and the control factors on their size run into two interesting problems. 

The first is strictly psychological, most folks would want a window view, so you aim to have hydroponics and factories and storage deep inside, the reverse of if you need sunlight for your food where the outside edge needs to be given over to hydroponics. 

In a fusion-powered setup you just have all these endless rooms lit mostly with red light to maximize photosynthesis with each room devoted to that being endless shelves of white or reflective material probably sealed off and mostly tended by robots. 

In both cases you recycle your water, sewage, and air supply through there. 

The other problem is called the Elevator Conundrum. 

The elevator conundrum is a term used to describe the problem that while having elevators allows for tall buildings, they also limit the height of tall buildings since you need to provide more elevators for each floor you add on. 

Doubling the height of building means doubling the people in it and slightly more than doubling the number of elevator shafts you need since those elevators also need longer travel times for the extra floors. 

Each shaft takes the same place up on each floor, so if you double your elevators you’re doubling the portion of your building given over to it, and again probably a decent amount more since you need those elevators to spend more time moving to go from top to bottom. 

This is a big deal with tall buildings, just as a quick example, if we needed 10% of the floor area to service a ten story building, say one that was 100x100 feet wide, 10,000 square feet per floor or 100,000 feet total, we’d have 10,000 square feet just devoted to elevators leaving only 90,000 for proper use. 

If we doubled that we’d needs 20% for elevators and our 200,000 square feet would need 40,000 for elevators and so we get 160,000 for other purposes, practically speaking probably less too from compensating for longer travel times. 

We doubled the area, we almost certainly more than doubled the construction cost, and yet we go from 90 to 160,000 usable footage and only got 78% more area. 

Adding ten more stories on, jumping to 30 floors and 300,000 total feet, and 30% devoted to elevators, give us only 210,000 feet for use, jumping to 40 stories, and 40% usable area, would give us only 240,000 usable square feet and at 50 stories we only get 250,000 feet, and at 60 stories we’re actually back down to 240,000 feet, and at 70 stories, 210,000. 

So at a certain point you’re not even getting diminishing returns as you get less and less area from each new level while it costs far more to build each new level, with the elevator conundrum you eventually get a point where you actually have less usable area. 

And there’s similar 2D problems with roads in cities too. 

Needless to say there are a lot of partial solutions to these problems, double decker elevators, express and dedicated elevators, dispatching techniques and so on. 

And it’s quite a fascinating problem with a lot of math, but interestingly arcologies partially get around it. 

An Arcology being essentially self-contained you have a lot of low traffic areas and a much lower population per square foot ideally. 

Remember early I said you’d need about 1-2000 square feet per person just for hydroponics, which doesn’t really need an elevator most days, whereas that’s a quite comfortable family sized apartment. 

You can also get away with a lot more levels because the first floor is no longer the primary destination for instance, and because there’s just more space per person. 

This doesn’t eliminate the elevator conundrum but it mitigates it an awful lot, and there’s never much point building higher than that would be a genuine concern for because you can always go wider instead and as we’ll see in the Ecumenopolis video even if you do every foot of your land and sea with arcologies, so that all that’s left is to go up, you hit the heat wall long before the elevator conundrum becomes critical. 

Also looking at an Arcology, where construction needs to be cheap enough, either to build or maintain, that devoting the majority of it to food production is viable, does require us to discard the notion of cramped buildings entirely. 

Arcologies are just something you don’t even build unless you’ve got the ability to make pretty spacious buildings in terms of individual area per person. 

We’ll look at that more in Ecumenpolis video but in short form, as long as you have to do your farming basically one level high, whether you’re doing that in land-inefficient but labor and cost-efficient open air farming or everything is being done in greenhouses, you just don’t need a lot of verticality to most of your buildings because it doesn’t benefit you. 

Human living, working, and shopping areas just don’t take up much real space. 

You look at Hong Kong and New York, the two cities with the most skyscapers, not only is neither of them even in the top 40 most densely populated cities, with the most dense, Manilla, barely having 50 skyscrapers, but neither takes up much actual land area even though most of the buildings aren’t even shorter high rises let alone tall skyscapers. 

Same as folks who don’t live in the country often forget how immense farms are, with larger ones often being bigger than cities, folks who mostly see metropolises on TV or going in for a shopping trip tend to forget that only a tiny fraction of the buildings in even the largest metropolises are 4 stories high or more, and only a small portion of those are skyscrapers. 

You might need all of an entire continent devoted to feeding our current population but you could comfortably house the entire population in one or two story suburban style micro-mansions without even denting your total area. 

Suburban housing densities of 14,000 people a square mile is not even a little cramped, that’s like a quarter-acre lot per family, and that would fit the whole human population into half a million square miles. 

Which sounds huge but is about the size of Spain. 

So you only start housing most of your population in tall towers when building them has gotten so cheap per square foot that you can plausibly start thinking about doing most of your farming indoors too. 

We might build an Arcology principally for the prestige, same as building the tallest building, but don’t ever expect them to become normal things a significant fraction of the population lives in until we can actually grow food economically indoors. 

It just couldn’t happen. 

If it did though, if we could do it economically, you could toss out the cramped apartment concept because living area would have had to have gotten proportionally a lot cheaper. 

And you can overlap growing area with living space too as your fish tank becomes part of your water recycling and produces food, your hallways being lit have plants growing on the sides, maybe your window curtains are actually a mesh fruit vines grow in, that sort of idea. 

Things we mostly don’t do now not because of space so much as time, doing them requires time and attention after all. 

Now there’s no optimal arrangement or size for these yet, so let’s walk through a conceptually and mathematically simple one. 

We’d previously said 1-2000 square feet was probably enough for food but let’s pad that out and remember we need other space too, and that we’re aiming for luxury and spaciousness. 

We don’t dystopia much on this channel. 

Let’s say an Arcology needed to devote 10,000 square feet to each person, and that includes not just living area but all the shops, farms, elevators, warehouses, public buildings, offices, and factories you’d need. 

You want to cram everyone into a monolithic tower you might as well give them a lot of breathing space. 

And let’s assume a population of 5000 per Arcology, also not entirely arbitrary, many places like my own state of Ohio use 5000 people as the official transition number from village to city and it happens be a value we often use for colony considerations in terms of both Dunbar’s number and minimum gene-pool to avoid genetic bottlenecking. 

Means you can have a specialist in almost every field living on site, and more than one of most. 

Means you can hypothetically know everyone in your own tower but is still big enough you can easily avoid people you don’t like. 

Means school class sizes don’t have three or four people, or three or four thousand, per grade. 

5000 is a good community size, it allows a lot of independence yet still massively benefits from cordial relations and trade with neighbors. 

We could go bigger or smaller but it’s a solid number and a mathematically convenient one. 

So how much space is that? 

5000 people needing an average of 10,000 square feet a piece for all their living, working, storage, recreation, and farming needs? 

Well its 50 million square feet, just under 2 square miles, about 4.6 square kilometers, just under a thousand acres or 500 Hectares. 

If we turn that into a 100 story high cylindrical building that would mean each circular floor needed to have half a million square feet and a radius of 400 feet. 

That incidentally is just under 3 times larger than the world-recorder holder, China’s New Century Global Center, in floor area, 8 times bigger than the Pentagon, and 15 times bigger than Khalifa Tower in Dubai, which is 154 levels high. 

All of these are deigned to either house or be workspace for a lot more than 5000 people, but remember this is all inclusive. 

It’s your parks and shops and factories and farms too. 

Now we don’t really think of cylinders or circular floors as the optimum design for window space, in fact it is the exact opposite, the shape which minimizes that exterior surface per volume, but the structure I’ve just described still has 2500 feet of circumference times 100 levels, or 250,000 feet of possible windows, or 50 feet per person for a population of 5000. 

That’s a lot of windows, especially considering most people prefer to live with someone else. 

We usually put the US coastline as being just under 100,000 miles, so if everyone lived in one of these and they only existed on the coast and only were spaced one per mile of coast you’d be able to pack about half a billion people into them, the population of the entire North American Continent, and leave the whole remainder of the continent over to forest if you wanted. 

If you just put one per square mile over the whole continent, keeping in mind that these only have a diameter of a sixth or seventh of that and would take up only a few percent of that square mile, you’d have ten million of these things with 50 billion people living in them, just in North America. 

Of course that would include tundra but an Arcology works just fine in tundra, desert, or ocean, or frankly on the moon, though they can generate a lot heat and would be harder to cool there. 

We’ll look at that issue and maximum packing in Ecumenpolis but its kind of key to understand that this concept of larger human populations living in dystopian trash dumps and eating Soylent Green is just a figment of over-population concepts from earlier science fiction. 

If you’ve got the power, either by fusion or secondhand fusion by solar, your real control factor is waste heat, not space, not food, and certainly not how many forests you can pave over. 

We’ll talk about that more next time too. 

Now you can builder these wider, you can build them taller, but if you’re a regular on this channel it seems pretty silly to try to impress people with sheer size. 

Last week we were talking about Matrioshka Brains and those can make classic Dyson Spheres look small and those are a billion times bigger than a planet, so some ten mile high building is not exactly over-awing at this point. 

In contrast the Arcology I just described is quite tiny and it’s still so large that if it wanted to have that central atrium a lot of skyscrapers go for with some trees in it, you could keep a full grown redwood in it. 

Nothing is really stopping you, besides maybe the elevator conundrum, from building these things so they stretch a mile underground and poke up into the upper atmosphere either. 

But larger arcologies, pretty much anything bigger than our 5000 person one I outlined, start needing ventilation, cooling, and transport networks built into them that are best compared to the human arterial or nervous networks. 

One reason you’d want to build them near a coast besides the view, much like a power plant, which would presumably be in the basement of one of these anyway, you’d need to suck in a lot of water to cool the places, and that can have positive effects on the local ecology too if done right. 

For that matter a lot of things can be done when you’ve got cheap power and automation that boost local ecologies. 

I talked before about the notion of vertical reefs in the oceans, just having fusion powered strings of light emitting at a photosynthesis optimized spectrum of light, to let plants grow far more abundantly and far deeper in the ocean, and you can do something similar on land too if you’ve got fusion, making your forest areas much taller and lusher by supplementing natural light with some photosynthetic calibrated red light and watering systems and fertilizer. 

There’s obviously a heat issue with something like that but it’s actually pretty minimal and considering some of the leviathan structures we’ve discussed elsewhere in the series, setting up solar shades between us and the sun that only blocked infrared light, which is again most of the sun’s emissions, would let you massively boost the amount of heat you could make on Earth without any ramifications to the ecology or aesthetics. 

Agriculture probably seems pretty boring compared to some of the subjects we look at on this channel and that’s probably why it tends to be a huge gaping hole in a lot of science fiction and futurism, fantasy too for that matter. 

Where you get your food from and how much food you can squeeze out of an area and how much labor that takes is a very big deal. 

These days we tend to grow crops as one giant field of all the same thing. 

The preferred way is polyculture where many different things are being grown to maximize the overall yield. 

That is more efficient, in terms of land or raw energy. 

What it isn’t more efficient in is equipment and manpower. 

Corn and wheat let you spew out a ton of calories from a large spot with very little human labor. 

That’s why they’re so cheap, and part of why things like strawberries are so expensive since we still need actual humans to do the picking. 

One man with a tractor can tend hundreds of acres of cereal crops while it can take the equivalent of an entire man year of labor to pick one acre of strawberries, which can actually yield a higher weight per acre than stuff like corn, albeit most of that weight is water not calories. 

We’ve a lot of crops that give much better yields in terms of calories than our staple crops but just take too much manpower to produce cheaply. 

It’s the human time, or the cost of machinery, which is our production bottleneck. 

We need those people for other tasks. 

That’s why we don’t just dome over every last drop of growing land, even though doing so would hugely increase yields and save huge amounts of water. 

We can still spend less time per calorie yielded by open air farming and have more than sufficient land to feed the population that way. 

As the dynamic shifts, either because we have more people than open air farming can support so have to go for more time-intensive but calorie-intensive production, or we get better robots, or we can spew out polycarbonate greenhouse sheeting for pennies on the dollar, our farms will begin shifting and probably our diet too. 

Many luxury crops that require a lot manpower to produce or have very touchy growing conditions would become more common and more to the point you can adapt elements of polyculture into industrial scale farming. 

And it wouldn’t always need to be robots either, I remember an example from Gregory Benford’s Galactic Center Series, coincidentally the earliest book I know of to reference arcologies by name, where they’d gene-tweaked their ants to go plant and harvest their corn, dutifully taking it kernel by kernel to silos and taking their share of the crop back to the hive. 

They didn’t use robots because robots were the bad guys in that series. 

Still while robotics is great stuff genetic engineering has its options too, for instance finding a way to make plants able to run on infrared light or green light too. 

Genetic Engineering like robotics is one of those controversial topics that some folks are fine with and others hate but I wanted to toss it out there as a reminder there’s lots of options. 

Most livestock tend to be inefficient grazers, trampling and ruining as much as they eat so if you could tweak them or the things they’re eating to avoid that for instance you get twice your yield. 

Arcology is a pretty broad-spectrum concept as I’ve been trying to emphasize and it really does extend across a lot of topics and disciplines and you try to fit the right one for what you want, what you can do, and what you’re willing to do. 

There are these giant climate-controlled warehouses where we grow lettuce for instance where they plant the suckers on little rafts on one end and pick them down on the other end and it just floats through like a slow conveyor belt, and you can expand the rafts the seedlings are on so you’re not wasting sunlight on them when they’re small. 

It’s not hard for me to imagine adapting that sort of concept to feeding livestock, like some big turf wheel that comes out at the trough and rolls slowly around through compact chambers spraying it with light and nutrients and rotating through like a conveyor belt over the course of a week. 

And there’s no reason you can’t double-dip on that to be raising fish off the water system being used or sucking the methane the cows are producing off be used as feedstock for fertilizer or plastics too. 

Again our bottleneck is a manpower and brainpower thing and increased automation, increased population, and so on really changes the playing field. 

That’s a topic we’ll be exploring more in the follow-up video on Ecumenopolises, where we’ll continue to blast away at this sort of Malthusian Apocalypse Myth that always seems so fixated on portraying humans and industrialized civilization as either intensely sterile or filthy places, and try to integrate how science and technology can allow more Eden-like setups without needing to decrease how many people we have and quite the opposite, actually have more people enjoying a higher standard of living without having to sacrifice many of things that we tend to feel are very important to who we are too.

Megastructures 10: Matrioshka Brains
---
  
2016-06-24  
https://youtu.be/Ef-mxjYkllw  

---

Today we’ll be finishing up our look at Dyson Spheres with Matrioshka Brains, sun-encompassing supercomputers of almost inconceivable computational power. 

So far we’ve seen how these object, Dyson Spheres, also known as Dyson Swarms or Stellar Engines, can be used to make more living area for people, to transmute lighter elements into heavier ones, to move ships and planets and whole solar systems, and even to blow up planets and systematically sterilize every planet in a galaxy. 

We’ve also mentioned how none of these purposes needs to be exclusive, and today’s example is no different. 

You don’t need to devote all of sun’s power just to computer processing. 

But the Matrioshka Brain partially subverts that. 

While it certainly permits other functions its architecture tilts heavily toward near exclusivity. 

The very name itself references the Matrioshka doll, a series of nested dolls, each inside the last, because of the way it recycles power at each subsequent layer. 

It’s geared toward maximizing the efficiency of a computer rather than simply dumping solar power into computers. 

Most descriptions of Matrioshka Brains just describe them as a giant computer without explaining the name. 

But it wasn’t picked out of a hat by Robert Bradbury when he introduced the concept about 8 years back. 

Giant star-powered computers, or even whole planets converted into computers like the Jupiter Brain are nothing new. 

They were a fairly common staple of science fiction even back in the 1950s though the increased miniaturization of computers tended to make them less common. 

It’s just hard to imagine why you’d ever need that much computing power. 

If you’ve seen the Transhumanism or Simulation Hypothesis videos on this channel though, you can probably guess at why you might. 

Storing Trillions of trillions of uploaded digital human minds, whole brain emulations, or simulating whole universes, is one of the reasons why you might build computers like this. 

And of course a third is that it might be one single immense brain, as the second half of the name implies. 

Even as huge as such brains are, potentially having processing power in excess of 10 to the 49 Hertz, trillions of trillions of trillions of times faster than our best modern computers, there’s still a lot of things that would take even a computer like this eons to make a dent in. 

Concepts like the Library of Babel, a hypothetical Library of the sort you’d expect the infinite monkeys working at typewriters would create, would barely be scratched by such a fast reader over the whole life of the Universe. 

And that’s something we’ll talk about more at a later date. 

Particularly in the context of how many genuinely unique, as opposed to arbitrarily unique, ideas and even personalities can exist. 

After all, while we can argue that a book with only a few words changed at random is essentially the same book, and with the human mind is constantly changing a little bit here and there, it is hard to argue that a specific exact pattern of information is genuinely meaningfully unique. 

And we may need to extend our notion of uniqueness to represent a potentially rather wide spectrum rather than a single specific pattern. 

We’ve looked at that notion in terms of consciousness and identity and I think sometime in the near future we need spend some more time on such concepts. 

But I’m digressing, back to the Mega-computer. 

Why these are nested layers is to allow you to absorb sunlight and then run calculations at a high temperature, which then gets emitted as waste heat, then in the next layer absorb that waste heat and run more calculations and emit your waste heat at a slightly lower temperature, and so on. 

If you picture a classic solar power computer you have a panel absorbing sunlight and running calculations and having cooling fans and heat sinks purging that heat. 

A simple sun-encompassing computer would simply be this scaled up to wrap around the sun, either as a rigid sphere of statites, ultra thin objects that can float on sunlight like a sheet of paper over a floor vent, an extension of the solar sail concept, or as a swarm of classic satellites. 

The Matrioshka Brain scales this up vertically too, by adding more layers beyond. 

At each layer the frequencies of light are being decreased, red-shifted, to higher states of entropy. 

It’s a bit of a skyscraper approach where the generator, a star, is down in the basement. 

There’s a limit as to how many layers you can have, but it’s squeezing the sun for every calculation you can get away with. 

You convert matter, specifically hydrogen, one of the lowest entropy things in the Universe, into calculations, one of the most useful things in the universe, recycling your energy at every step. 

Of course no recycling process is perfectly efficient, but you can think of it a lot like water conservation, where you use your bath or dishwater to water your garden. 

Any good machine tries to do this, get a second or third or fourth stage where your waste and leftovers act as the fuel for another process. 

Without going into the thermodynamics of heat engines, it’s usually easiest to picture one of these devices as a series of nested thin rigid spheres, though that is hardly necessary or ideal. 

Each successive layer is cooler, and I find it easiest to think of each layer as four times further away than the last, since that makes it half the temperature. 

Now you can take my word on that if you’re not math inclined but to review that fairly quickly, in space where the only way to cool objects is through thermal radiation, a roughly spherical object’s temperature will always be related to its total surface area and the power it is emitting. 

This also controls its peak wavelength. 

Which for the sun for instance, our yellow dwarf, is actually in the green range. 

Colder objects red-shift that peak frequency, hotter objects blue shift. 

But the fusion that drives the sun is not producing green photons or yellow ones or any other visible photon, down in the sun’s core where fusion happens it’s all gamma radiation. 

Those gamma rays get absorbed and re-emitted as simple heat and the sun radiates that heat the same as a glowing red hot bar of metal or an incandescent light bulb. 

Since the power radiated by any object, per unit of surface area, rises with the fourth power of temperature, if you double its temperature it will emit sixteen times the power, and if you half it, one sixteenth. 

The sun emits at the frequency of light we see because that’s the frequency an object with that much surface area can emit that much power without getting any hotter. 

So to radiate the same power, but at half the temperature, our second sphere would need to be four times wider, since a sphere’s surface area goes with the square of its width, four times wider, 16 times the surface area, and therefore half the temperature. 

Now I also like using these half-temperature steps because it plugs in easily to Carnot’s thereom, that no engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs, and the efficiency of a Carnot Engine is 1 minus the temperature of the cold reservoir divided by the hot reservoir. 

In this case the reservoirs would be two adjoining layers of the Matrioshka Brain and since each layer is half the temperature of the last, each step is 50% efficient. 

So if we had our first layer at 1000 Kelvin and our next layer at 500 Kelvin, one a bit closer to the sun than the planet of Mercury and one a bit further, we’d get an efficiency of 1 – 500 divided by 1000, or 1 minus one-half, or one half, or 50% efficiency. 

You might be wondering why we couldn’t just jam another layer between those two, and let’s say we did, at what would produce 750 Kelvin, about where Mercury would be. 

Well that first pair would have an efficiency of 1 minus 750 over 1000, or 1 minus .75, or 25%, not very efficient at all, and the next layer would be 1 minus 500 over 750, 1 minus two-thirds or one-third or about 33%. 

So you’re not really getting much advantage by just cramming in more and more layers. 

Particularly since that peak wavelength represents a peak that’s pretty wide. 

As I said the sun’s peak wavelength is in the green range, but it emits plenty of light all the way up in UV range and more than half its light is emitted below the edge of red light in the infrared range of spectrum. 

That math we just did for the Carnot cycle is the absolute maximum efficiency physics allows, practically speaking you won’t even get that. 

And you’d need to do your spacing to optimize the next layer, for instance if you’re using semiconductors to convert photons into electricity, essentially how solar panels work, you want to optimize your waste light to work best with those. 

And if you’ve got yourself a substance that is very good for 10 micrometer wavelengths, the peak wavelength at 290 Kelvin, or 62 degrees Fahrenheit, and another that works well at 15 micrometers, which corresponds to 190 Kelvin or -118 Fahrenheit, it makes sense to match your layers up to that. 

We’ve no idea what sort of specific mechanical or chemical constraints will apply to control that optimization so we can’t really say much about how many layers and their spacing we’d have. 

And indeed you don’t have to have discrete layers. 

This works perfectly fine in a swarm format too, more of a fog or cloud around a star then discrete layers. 

Your fundamental limit is the temperature of the star, and how hot you can make your computers and related equipment run at, for the bottom layer, and for the top layer the sort of ambient temperature of your area of the galaxy or Universe has and how much construction material you have. 

The whole Universe is saturated with photons at about 2.7 Kelvin, which happens to be about the transition point from infrared radiation to microwaves, and why we call that Cosmic Background Radiation as CMR or CMBR, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. 

Way back in the day it was a much higher frequency, shorter wavelength. 

Back when the universe was younger, about 400,000 years old instead of about 14 billion, the Universe was a pretty dense and opaque fog of a place. 

And quite hot too, basically the entire Universe was the temperature of a star’s surface, all glowing white hot plasma, but it was cooling down from the Universe expanding and finally reached the point that atoms with nuclei and electron shells could exist and when they popped up the Universe wasn’t opaque anymore and photons could travel long distances without scattering and getting absorbed. 

Since the nature of the expansion means that no matter when you’re around there will always be photons from that era just showing up where you can still see that initial wad of photons and they are everywhere. 

But they redshift, get weaker, over time as they had to cover more and more space to have arrived by now and that space was expanding and red shifting them. 

If you measured that CMB some billions of years ago it would have been a higher temperature and frequency. 

Indeed for a while after this original event the whole sky would have visibly glowed and it’s only relatively recently it left the infrared range and entered microwaves. 

One day, far in the future, The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation will become Cosmic Radio Wave Background Radiation and the coldest spots in the Universe won’t be 2.7 Kelvin but thousands or even millionths of a Kelvin. 

That will be important when we get to the Black Hole Farming video in three weeks. 

Right now that’s your bottom limit though, and in fact it’s a bit higher because there’s plenty of other ambient light kicking around especially inside a galaxy with all its stars emitting light and random particles whacking into things that sets a slightly higher minimum temperature. 

This is what I mean about never being able to hide a Dyson Sphere when I talk about that in the context of the Fermi Paradox. 

Even ignoring the very obvious gravitational anomaly of a missing solar system, which would be easily seen by any Kardashev 2 civilization, and the way it would block light from the other side of it, it still emits waste heat. 

That’s how the Matrioshka Brain works after all. 

If we didn’t have any of that background radiation hitting our Dyson Sphere and warming it up, we’d still need to make it very big to get it down to 2.7 Kelvin. 

Our Sun’s surface glows at about 6000 Kelvin, if we wanted it to glow at half that temperature, as I mentioned aarlier, we’d need a shell around it 4 times wider. 

And if we built a shell around that sun where Earth was at it would glow at the temperature Earth does, around 300 Kelvin, at Earth’s distance of 1 AU, one Astronomical Unit. 

At 4 AU it would be about half that temperature or 150 Kelvin, 75 Kelvin at 16 AU, out near Uranus, and at 64 AU a bit out past Pluto it would be more like 40 Kelvin. 

At that point all the background radiation starts actually being significant to temperatures but if we just ignored that, to get a sphere at about 100th Earth’s temperature’s or about that background temperature of the Universe, you’d need to have 100 to the fourth power, or 100 million times the surface, which would need a width at the square root of that, or 10,000 times as far away from the sun as Earth is. 

10,000 AU in radius, about a six of a light year or two light months in radius, and double that for its diameter or width, which incidentally would be about 4 million times wider than the sun and take up 16 trillion times the surface area. 

That’s a pretty big object to miss seeing and again it won’t actually be that temperature since it’s also absorbing and re-emitting all the background radiation hitting it from outside. 

You could never get a Dyson’s exterior layer down to that temperature. 

Sometimes folk suggest to me that it might be close enough to that temperature to hide, since there are warm and cold spots in the CMB, but I think most folks don’t realize that those cold spots for instance, the big giant ones that bother cosmologists, being colder than the 2.7 Kelvin everything is supposed to be, are actually a lot less than a thousandth of Kelvin off from the norm of 2.7 Kelvin, 70 millionths of a Kelvin normally. 

If you had a variation of even thousandth of a Kelvin it would show up to us, now, with our modern tech, like if someone took a big white canvas with slightly off-white shades and maybe a few very light gray spots then put a big black mark on it. 

To dampen that down so a Dyson might pass for a warm spot, it would need to be so large you’d end up needing to move other star out of the way to avoid including them, which as I mentioned a couple episodes back is not exactly a covert and subtle thing either. 

But let’s stick with the 10,000 AU radius for a moment, the one with 100 million times the surface area of the Classic Dyson Sphere. 

I’ve mentioned before how you don’t need much more than a large asteroid or maybe a very small planet to build a very basic Dyson Swarm, if it’s just very thin, but something with a hundred million time the surface area would need 100 million times the building material, which would require hundreds of stars worth of material. 

And it’s kind of hard to imagine why that would be considered a practical idea, especially considering that fusing all that construction material up from hydrogen would release a few hundred times more energy than the sun would emit over its whole life. 

Again not a very subtle or covert thing to do. 

So we can’t really use that top reservoir of 2.7 Kelvin for computation nor to hide a Dyson. 

It’s impossible not too mention insanely impractical to try to come close to it. 

You can make a pretty good case for building your swarm all the way out Pluto, since you’d only need a couple thousand times the normal Dyson Mass, not a hundred million, and since at those temperatures you can still basically disregard background radiation, but past that you begin getting seriously diminishing returns. 

That dynamic changes a lot if we’re using black holes instead of suns as our engines and if the CMB has dropped down to a lower temperature, but we’ll look at that more in the Black Hole Farming video in a few weeks. 

Now I already mentioned the Carnot Limit on efficiency of heat engines, and a Dyson Sphere is definitely one of those, but in the past I’ve also mentioned something called the Landauer Limit, which puts the absolute maximum on how much computation you can get out of a processor for a given amount of energy and at a given temperature. 

Our computers nowadays don’t run anywhere near that limit, it’s the sort of thing that lets you run millions of supercomputers or whole brain emulations off the power of a light bulb, but it also needs to be considered for a Matrioshka Brain and I was a little disappointed nobody seems to have done an analysis on that. 

See the star’s luminosity, it’s power output, puts a maximum on how much power each layer has to do calculations with, and Carnot tell us what percentage of that we can actually convert to do work with, in this case calculations, and again if you’re going in powers of 4 for your distance, halving the temp at each step, that would be 50%. 

But Landauer tells us how many calculations we can do with that power, or how much power each calculation takes minimum. 

And that’s linear to temperature so your inner and hotter layers do less computing than your outer layers. 

If they are running at that limit each successive layer, at half the temperature, is actually doing twice as much work in terms of calculations. 

It’s not really smarter though since it may be doing twice the thinking but is spreading that out over 16 times the area. 

So smarter but slower perhaps. 

Signal lag is a pretty big deal for such things. 

But only if they’re a singular intelligence. 

We usually envision it that way, that’s why it’s a Matrioshka Brain, but it hardly needs to be singular. 

You can run tons of smaller minds, human ones or much larger, and not really have that lag issue. 

I think in the Transhumanism or Simulation Hypothesis video I said based on current approximations of the computing power needed to run a human mind you could do it with a solar panel about the size of a postage stamp, but let’s be a bit more formal about this and in the context of the nested layer Matrioshka Brain. 

Let’s just say for the moment that everything is running perfectly so we only need to consider Carnot and Landuaer Limits. 

Now it’s fairly simple to recognize that only your last layer really matters, each one above it would do half the processing and one plus half plus a quarter plus an eighth and so on add up to two, which would negate that 50% efficiency from the Carnot Limit, and that’s almost regardless of what your star’s temperature is, that when contrasted against the CMB you end up with near 100% efficiency. 

The real power comes from how cold your last layer is, not the how hot your star is, though this only works this way if you can actually compute down at the Landuaer Limit. 

Anyway you can calculate for each discrete layer and add them up, but it will always roughly approximate the last layer running at just under 100% efficiency and calculating at that temperature. 

And the whole thing works out to about 10 to the 49th Hertz of total processing. 

Which is about 40 orders of magnitude, ten thousand, trillion, trillion, trillion times more processing power than whatever device you’re probably watching this on and 34 orders of magnitude more than our current best guess to simulate a human mind. 

So hypothetically your Matrioshka Brain could run 10 to the 34th or 10 billion, trillion, trillion emulations of people simultaneously and in real time. 

That’s a lot more than the about 10 billion people we have on earth or about the 10 billion-billion we’d expect a classic Dyson Sphere could hold. 

Though in the upcoming Arcology and Ecumenopolis videos we’ll see those are a couple orders of magnitude shy of a plausible comfortable maximums. 

But that’s still a couple orders of magnitude, not a couple dozen. 

And if you scaled this up to be galaxy encompassing, having one around each star, you could add 10 or 11 more orders of magnitude on to come out at around 10 to the 44th or 45th power. 

And none of these folks would really need to worry about lag time for their own thoughts at least. 

Even if they were running a lot faster than a normal human mind or a lot bigger. 

The power plant for a mind at that hot bottom layer is smaller than a pencil dot, and even out on the outermost layer we’d still be talking about a normal sized modern solar panel. 

Now it’s pretty obvious what you’d do with all that processing power if you’re emulating people, and I generally don’t think of it as emulation, a mind is a mind whether it’s running on brain cells, computer chips, or a million monkeys or ants each replicating the action of a brain cell, like we discussed in the Transhumanism video, but whichever, you use that processing power to run people. 

On the other hand if we’re talking about one big mega-mind, or problem solving tool, it’s kind of hard to imagine what you’d do with all that computing power. 

Especially an up-gunned version of this where you need calculate really quickly and build it around a giant star with a much higher surface temperature and tens of thousands of times more power, like Spica, or even bigger ones potentially millions of times brighter than our sun. 

Or around a neutron star. 

For when you need to solve the secrets of the universe or the gajillionth digit of Pi on a tight schedule I suppose. 

And the answer to what you’d do with that much processing power is I have no damned idea. 

I generally tend to think things like how to break the speed of light or laws of Thermodynamics or jumping into other Universes is either flat out impossible, no matter how much brains you throw at it, or something you could probably solve with a lot less than a God-mind, which is the only meaningful way to even look at a Matrioshka Brain as a singular intelligence. 

I have no idea what they’d spend their time thinking about but when you’ve got the processing power to simulate trillions of worlds simultaneously through their whole history in an eye blink without working up a sweat it throws some strange light on concepts like the Simulation Hypothesis. 

We talked about super-intelligence a couple weeks back and beyond defining it generally we couldn’t make much headway and I’ve never seen a fictional example any of the tons of scifi novels and short stories I’ve read that have managed to represent anything significantly smarter than a human in a way that felt believable to me let alone something of this sort of leviathan capacity. 

Okay so that was Matrioshka Brains, which closes out our look at Dyson Spheres too and sort of brings us to the end of the Megastructures series in terms of scale. 

We can go beyond this in terms of scale to look at galaxy spanning structures or even ones using multiple galaxies, but it really is just an increase in scale, not concept. 

We can and will go beyond these in terms of time, to look at how objects like these might continue to exist in slightly different ways when you can’t use stars anymore when we look at black hole farming in three weeks. 

But before that we’ll be heading way back down in scale to look at Arcologies, giant structures that are sort of a mix of skyscraper and space station that we can build here on Earth, and following it up the next week with an extension of that idea to look at Ecumenopolises, planet spanning cities, and we’ll have some fun poking holes in some of the misconceptions around these. 

Especially the notion that they’re sterile dystopian hive cities of concrete. 

Arcologies and Ecumenopolises are too connected for me not to treat them as a single subject even though we’ll be breaking them into two videos, so we will be going back to back. 

Especially because there’s a lot of material to cover since a proper Ecumenopolis has to also take into account the sort of swarms of space stations, satellites, and habitats around the planet that would be every bit as much a part of that world city as ports, railroad yards, and suburbs are to major metropolitan areas now. 

So those are our topics for the next three weeks. 

Arcologies followed by Ecumenopolises followed by Black Hole Farming.

Megastructures 09 Nicoll Dyson Beams

2016-06-17  
https://youtu.be/RjtFnWh53z0  

---

So today’s topic is the Nicoll-Dyson Beam, a great big space gun that can turn a star’s entire solar output into a laser that tears into targets with a destructive power equal to several trillion nuclear bombs a second. So with that in mind we’re going to explain how such a device works, talk a little bit about blowing up planets or even sterilizing whole galaxies, and talk a bit about why you might build such a device and what non-destructive uses it has. And we’ll finish out with some channel updates. 

If you’ve already been following along with our discussion of Dyson Spheres, or Dyson Swarms, in the Megatructures Series or the Dyson Dilemma then you know the basics. If not I’ll review them quickly but you might want to click on video link to jump back and watch those first. And as always, if you’re not used to my voice you should turn on the closed caption subtitles down by the subscribe button. 

Okay, a Dyson Sphere is a collection of artificial bodies surrounding a sun, theoretically that could be one giant rigid sphere like an inside out planet if you’ve got the magical technologies for cheap transmutation and artificial gravity, but what was originally meant by sphere was basically a cloud or swarm of smaller satellites. These could be power gatherers or artificial rotating habitats like we discussed back in episode 4, and under known science the only way to do a rigid sphere around a star or have components hover in the same place is if they are ultra thin mirrors, called statites, floating over the sun from light pressure like a solar sail or like a sheet of paper hovering over a floor vent. 

For our purposes today it doesn’t matter, since on the list of difficult tasks involved in building any Dyson Sphere, rigid or swarm, keeping all those bodies on the right trajectories and not bumping into each other barely makes the list. In fact one of the main uses of a Nicoll-Dyson Beam, or smaller versions of it, is to give objects little taps to get them back on the right path or vaporize dangerous space garbage. 

The concept is pretty simple, once you’ve got a bunch of mirrors around a sun you’ve got access to all that power, which is a couple billions times what Earth receives. That gives us the sunlight to light a couple billion more planets, or to push the entire solar system across the galaxy like we discussed last time in the Shkadov Thrusters video, or to use more modest setups to push spaceships up to interstellar speeds or vaporize asteroids and the like. But it also gives you the power to incinerate whole planets around other solar systems. And this is also a pretty cheap thing to build. 

Like the Shkadov thruster, when you’re only surrounding your star with thin mirrors even a single large asteroid or moon probably has enough matter to make one. It’s sort of like wrapping your star with tin foil as opposed to hundreds of feet thick dirt and ocean. 

Unlike the Shkadov Thruster you do need a big lens to focus that beam if you’re planning to hit Earth-sized targets around other stars, but you can make lenses much larger when you can build them in zero-gravity environments not to mention there being a lot of tricks for making effectively giant lenses from small components. It’s worth remembering after all that a normal glass lens is actually composed of trillions of tiny atoms that are themselves mostly composed of empty space. You can also use a lot of the dynamic support structures we saw through the series starting with orbital rings and space fountains up to shell worlds and discsworlds to make some very giant rigid lenses you can change focal length and direction with. This isn’t a laser or optics video though, so will suffice it to say that you can get that energy lined up into a beam with a very long range. There’s some debate about how long, but as we’ve already discussed you can push on things with mirrors on their back anyway so even if you can’t pinpoint a planet on the other side of the galaxy you can ram a giant mirror missile up to relativistic speeds with some minimal guidance on it to make corrections to its own trajectory and just ram your target for the same effect. And that’s actually the better course of action anyway as we’ll discuss later. Great big laser, simple concept. But how much energy does it actually take to blow up a planet? 

We all remember in Star Wars, unless you’ve been living in a cave for the last 40 years, where the Death Star just nukes the Planet Alderaan in one fast shot. You might also have seen movie theories where folks wonder about why when they are going to do the same thing to the Moon of Yavin they have to wait till it is out from behind the gas giant to shoot instead of just blowing up the gas giant planet then shooting the moon. 

Now Star Wars aims for scientific accuracy the with a level of marksmanship worse than the storm troopers featured in the films so wondering about that is pretty pointless, but here I actually makes sense. The amount of energy needed to blow up any object big enough to be held together by its own gravity has to exceed what we call gravitational binding energy, or just binding energy. And generally speaking that way more the doubles if you double the mass of a planet, closer to the square of mass. This is one of the reasons why asteroid are much nicer than planets for mining and space construction of megastructures, to extract mass from them and carry it away just cost way less energy because they have so little gravity and no atmospheres getting in the way. One good nuke could explode a small asteroid whereas even a Nicoll-Dyson Beam, which as I mentioned could pour out the equivalent of trillions of nukes a second and still need a whole week to torch Earth. 

To do something like Jupiter, which masses a few hundred times as much as Earth, wouldn’t take a few hundred times as long but closer to a housand times a long, needing a thousand times the energy. Gas Giants are physically quite large for their mass since they’re not very dense which makes them a bit easier to blow up than an equal mass rocky planet, but it still takes more juice than just the increase in raw mass would suggest. Very massive dense things like white dwarf stars or neutron stars take insane amounts of energy to rip apart and a black hole would arguably be impossible to. 

In any event, the Death Star is already on the stupid side of overkill so engineering it to blow up gas giants would mean gunning it up a thousand fold. A Nicoll-Dyson Beam could rip apart Jupiter for instance but it would take a week to torch Earth and decades to do Jupiter, though I can think of a few reasons why you would actually want to do that. Especially if you’re in the Transmutation game and want to turn your gas giant into construction material for a more robust Dyson Sphere instead of one composed tin foil. 

Of course you don’t actually need to totally vaporize a planet if you just want to kill everyone on it. Even just torching off the crust is serious overkill. There’s an old episode of Deep Space Nine, “the Die is Cast” where a combined Romulan and Cardassian fleet of twenty ships is getting ready to torch an enemy planet and one of the crews says the crust will be destroyed within an hour and the mantle within five. 

This is a good indication the Star Trek has a habit for aiming for scientific accuracy with all precision Star Wars does, I never know how Trek got a reputation as the science-focused of the two, and is pretty tactically crazy too. First it means your average Star Trek starship is carrying around the equivalent of a whole sun in its reactor, and second, as Chuck Sonnenburg from SFDebris put it, unless your enemy is the lava people taking out the mantle of a planet is pretty silly. Taking out a whole planet of Earth’s Size requires something like 10^32 Joules of Energy, again multiple days of our sun’s entire output, or something like a trillions tons of antimatter, which is around a million times how much that whole fleet should mass out at. 

Alternatively you don’t even need a hundredth of that energy to strip off a planetary crust and even that is pretty serious overkill. It’s kinda hard to put an exact figure on how much energy you’d need to sterilize a planet since that would vary by planet and you’d need to decide if you were going for a 100% certain kill of everything down to the toughest bunker buried under mountains or tiniest microbes in the bottom of ocean trenches or not. But it’s a lot less than 10^30 Joules. Our atmosphere is about a millionth of the Planet’s mass and superheating that till it was hot enough to evaporate into space ought to do the trick, and that would require more like a few seconds of the sun’s output. And you’d probably want to go maybe an order of magnitude higher and dribble that in over the course of the target planet’s day so it can just rotate around on its axis while you peel it like an apple. 

Key point there though is that you don’t need anything like an entire Dyson Sphere to give yourself a planet destroyer, so we’d have to consider all Dyson Spheres to have this capability same as they all can so the Shkadov Thruster trick of slowly moving the entire solar system across the galaxy. And if you got big lenses that can target planets light years away you’ve also got great big old telescopes that can flat out see planets with ease on the other side of a galaxy. So if you happen to be a genocidal race, even one that doesn’t want to roam the galaxy, you can pretty much torch every planet in that galaxy without leaving your home solar system, because you could devote less than 1% of your solar economy to roasting planet after planet, targeting hundreds at a time for whatever their day length was. An even if there were a hundred billion target planets in your galaxy, well, that would just be a billion days, or 3 million years, to get them all, way way less time than it would take for any remnant microbe left buried on the bottom of an ocean trench to respawn complex life on that planet if all you’d done was to rip off the atmosphere and boil the surface of land and sea. And you could get the job done a lot faster if you used your entire solar output or annexed some neighboring stars for this purpose. Especially a giant. Our sun is not very massive, while we call it a yellow dwarf it out masses 95% of all other stars and is about 10,000 times brighter than the weakest of red dwarf stars. But luminosity tends to go at about the third to fourth power of the mass and Spica, a nearby giant star only about 250 light years away and only about ten times our sun’s mass is more than 10,000 times as bright, and there are stars out there millions of times as bright that if converted into Nicoll-Dyson Beam could actually flat out vaporize Earth in a second, and sterilize thousands every second. They could torch every planet in the galaxy, even if every star had one potentially habitable one, in a very short time. They could probably sterilize a whole galaxy in a week and flat out vaporize them in only a few thousand years of output, and since the light would need a hundred thousand years to get to the furthest targets that’s not exactly a long timetable. This is one of the reasons why I tend to hand wave away the notion of xenocidal alien races creeping across the galaxy attacking everyone or sending out swarms of self-replicating machines to do it, things we could conceivably fight for a nice science fiction story. Sterilizing a galaxy if you’ve got just a tiny head start on everyone else is just way too easy. Now one of the problems with this is that since there is that really long lag time is that you not only have no way to call off the attack once it’s been fired, even if the shot takes thousands of year to arrive, but that aiming at something planet sized might just turn out to be beyond us for any clever tricks we might play with focal lenses. That brings up the main non-destructive use of these devices because you can use smaller forms to push big ships up to speed. So you could use these to move ships around your solar system, you can quarter your light sails same as a wind sail for lateral motion and you can stick mirrors out a distance to bounce light back inward to push ships in, or slow ships down as they enter your solar system, or adjust the trajectory of space stations and so on. 

But you could also stick mirrors on the back of a fairly stealthy giant missile and speed it up over the course of days or week or months or years until it had all the kinetic energy got from the nicoll-dyson beam and then proceed on with just a little bit of steerage fuel and simple auto-pilot to go whack its target. And you can just send a small swarm of them to impact that place over a few days even if you spent years dumping energy into them. 

They just get up to speed, fold up their light sails, and cruise in. Incidentally these are called RKM’s, RKV’s or RKKVs or RM’s or a few other variations, Relativistic Kinetic Missile, and basically describes any weapon whose sheer kinetic energy makes the inclusion of a bomb, even a warhead made of anti-matter, basically redundant because they already carry more energy than a bomb of their mass would release. 

I’ve mentioned on the channel quite a few times that an invading alien armada doesn’t need to slow down and park in orbit to bombard us, they just have to throw some garbage out an airlock in our direction before slowing down and we’d get smacked up like it was World War 3. And if you’re using your Nicoll-Dyson Beam to accelerate your RKM’s instead of as a direct beam weapon you can include some sort of abort procedures in whatever computer or AI or suicide squad is piloting the thing. I’ve also heard Nicoll-Dyson Beams and RKMs in general described as equivalent to MAD, mutually assured destruction, or even flat out first use weapons since there’s no defense against them, no advance warning to get off a counter strike, but that’s not actually true. 

Like any war scenario where your enemy outnumbers you or has more tech you are pretty screwed especially if they are fine with Scorched Earth styles of warfare, literally Scorched Earth in this case, since Asymmetric Warfare tends to be much harder to do if the enemy’s actual goal is outright genocide, which is not the case if you want to kill people and take their land. The main goal is to take their land. We’re talking about Scorched Earth, where the goal is killing them specifically and the land is just in the way. 

But if you have rough parity of tech and numbers Nicoll-Dyson Beams and RKM’s are like anything else, and the apparent inability to defend against them is just a lack of imagination. 

Like most cases you’ve got 5 defenses against a weapon. You can prevent anyone ever using it on you, either by diplomatic means or first strike, you can blow up the weapon so it can’t shoot, you can intercept the shot en route with something else, you can armor yourself against the thing so it doesn’t hurt as bad, or you cannot be where it is shooting. 

In regard to the latter 3, both of these are weapons that take years if not millennia to get to their target. We’ve talked in the past about moving planets or solar system and that is itself pretty time consuming but not so much when you’re just trying to be one step to the right, as it were. You can proof a target against a weapon that can’t change direction – which includes beams and for the most part RKMs too – by just jittering you acceleration bit in a random fashion. It doesn’t take a lot of acceleration for a lot of time to move something as big as we tend to envision starship to be so that it isn’t where you’d expect it to be from observing its trajectory. It migth make the crew kind of nauseous, the spaceship equivalent of seasickness, but that’s okay. Now doing that to a planet or solar system is a lot harder but you can do it over years. 

Alternatively if you’re a K2 civilization living in your own Dyson Swarm, trillions of rotating habitats, well as I discussed in that video they’re a lot more durable where life is concerned because while on a planet the thin shield of air is over you and the thick shield of stone is beneath you, it’s reversed on rotating habitats. 

To hurt the folks inside you’ve got to burn through all that armor and shielding, and you can also shine the outside up like a mirror to make it more resistant to attacks of this sort. That also makes it a bit easier to give a good shove with smaller version of your own Nicoll-Dyson Beam and lets you keep all your habitats, which are much smaller targets then planets anyway, in positions that can’t be predicted years in advance unlike a planet. 

You can also put swarms of mirrors between you and the enemy system to seriously reduce the weapon’s power and blow up RKM’s that ram into them. And while you can give an RKM a bit of maneuverability they just can’t be made to go zipping light years out of their way and steering back on course, and if they ram into just about anything they’ll be torn to shreds and scatter like a shotgun blast. 

And you just can’t use one star’s entire power to torch an entire enemy dyson swarm since that’s like trying to burn someone to death with a regular flashlight, all you can do is focus on a spot and again they will all be mirror-surfaced and any give spot on the shell of a dyson swarm is on any given day composed of millions of different object moving on millions of different trajectories. You’d need a much bigger star or many different stars all firing at once. So the Nicoll-Dyson beam is a great weapon if you have first strike ability, having shown up on the galactic scene with a head start, and want to stay at home rather than expand out into the stars, but it’s not likely to be used for warfare when there’s a lot of systems that have them too. And it is more likely to be used to power RKM’s then as a straight beam I’d think. 

And everyone would have them too. They’re just not that hard to build as an addition to an existing dyson swarm and you can scale it up as you add to your Dyson Swarm, and its simply too useful for other purposes. It would be great to have fusion powered ships or black hole powered ships like we discussed in other videos, but you basically need a small scale Nicoll-Dyson beam to make the KugelBlitz black holes we discussed there and even if you’ve got a fusion reactor on your spaceship being able to give it a big boost to speed initially, or slow down returning ones, with you Nicoll-Dyson Beams, saves you a ton of fuel allowing a higher transit speed or more cargo. So you might as well. You just have some massive thin solar sail like tinfoil that you spread out when getting beamed and otherwise fold up front to serve as extra shielding against radiation and get smacked by tiny relativistic particles while in transit to your destination. 

So you’d pretty much always have the lensing device, or devices, hanging around your solar system anyway ready for some minor reconfiguration as a weapon that you could jam way more power through. So that’s our look at Nicoll-Dyson Beams and another look at an aspect of Dyson Spheres that’s pretty much inherent to them all. 

As we’ve seen, you can use them to really increase your effective living area and energy access, you can use them to move planets and solar systems, you can sue them for transmutation of elements to just run great big supercolliders if you’ve got no better way of turning hydrogen into useful construction materials, and now we see you can use them to propel space ships and as a devastating weapon. We’ll get to the channel update in a moment, just as a headsup next week is going to be the Megastructures again as we take a look at Matrioshka Brains, another type of Dyson Sphere where we basically use a star as a giant computer. After that I’m not sure, and so we do have a poll this week for the next video. Here are the topics to pick from, a return to the Habitable Planets series with a look at Panthallassic Planets, also known as Water Worlds. A trip back to more modern times to look at Arcologies, the concept for giant structures on Earth that make Skyscraper look small, or Ecumenpolises, giant world spanning cities like we see in Star Wars imperial capital of Coruscant or Isaac Asimov’s planet of Trantor from the Foundation Series, these would probably include arcologies, but I don’t think we need to cover them first to do it and I can always wrap them in to this video if folks prefer. Or we can hop back to the Faster Than Light Series for our delayed look at Wormholes. Last option is to jump way ahead in time to the end of Universe to look at civilization after all the star have died and nothing is left but black holes, in the Black Hole Farming video. You guys vote, I’ll go with that. 

Okay onto the Channel update. I picked this video and it’s follow up for next week, Matrioshka Brains, because the megastructures series in general tends to be my most familiar ground and usually are shorter videos, and with all the new things for the channel combined with me being very busy next week I wanted to go for videos that I could be sure I could get done in that time. No risk of getting writer’s block on the script, and the videos have been in the queue for a bit and I do want to clear the queue after skipping one week then having an unscheduled one after that. 

The response to my request last week for help and suggestions for the channel was overwhelming, and from a personal perspective it was very uplifting. 

I know a lot folks say their audience is the best in the world, and many probably even mean it, but it is nice to get objective proof, and the commenting and interaction on this channel is higher than most channels with ten times the views and subscribers. So we win on quantity and we certainly win on quality, the questions and comments are almost universally polite and thoughtful, and I genuinely enjoy reading and responding to them. 

You’re a great bunch and you make creating these videos a lot of fun for me. I don’t think ‘thank you’ can really express the level of appreciation I have for that, but there it is. Okay so what’s changing? The simple answer is nothing, I accidentally gave some of you the impression last week I was thinking about moving or closing up shop. What is happening is we’re adding on features, some are definite, some I’m still considering, and a lot of them I’ll skip for now until the firm up. 

I asked for ideas and I got tons of them sent in. I asked for volunteers to help implement them and got those too. So first, we’ve got a website under construction, that will be at IsaacArthur.net, and once that’s up it will be linked in all the video descriptions. I considered some sort of new channel name and maybe we’ll go that route one day but I couldn’t think of anything accurate or that didn’t sound like a jingo so I’ll just stick with my name for now. As that gets built it will have all the videos on it with FAQs and commentary and other features as they emerge. 

Second, some folks mentioned a preference for being able to download the videos or just the audio portion to better accommodate mobile device and bandwidth and download limits, and we’ll be doing that sooner than later but it may be a few weeks and I haven’t picked a method yet. How fast that gets done will depend on available time so if anyone is already familiar with the process for things like itunes or soundcloud and has some free time to help, let me know. Third, I mentioned last time that the channel has a Patreon account now, and the initial wave was a very pleasant surprise, but I also mentioned that they encourage you to do rewards for patrons and after talking about this with some of you, a suggestion that came up fairly often was to raffle off the topic for a video from among the patrons, where the winner gets to pick the topic for a video, obviously within certain guidelines. I’ll work out the details and hopefully have that first contest before the end of July. We’d probably do it once a month. 

In the tentative category, and of a similar concept, I’ve had it suggested I might do the occasionally sci-fi review and I kinda like the idea of having a featured author every so often. There’s already a lot of great reviewers out there, but books do tend to get neglected in video formats like this, so I’m open to the notion of looking at some of the classics from time to time. I’m also always looking for graphics and art submissions to be used on the channel, that’s something you can never have too much of, and I kind of like the idea of having a featured artist every so often where we can take 30 or 40 seconds out of video to take a look at those and let you know where to see more of their work, and maybe host a gallery of channel art on the website. 

If we go that route the first winner would be Jakub, who kindly volunteered to do some of the cover art for the channel, and you can see more of his work by clicking on the link in the video description. Volunteer-wise we’re still looking for anyone with a background in social media, especially reddit, to help get the videos out there and to help administrate any sort of forum or facebook group the channel goes with. And as always I really appreciate when folks share the videos around. 

Anyway that’s the situation as of now, there some more but it’s not flushed out yet, keep sending me ideas because they’ve been great ones so far. More updates as they develop in the next month. As always questions and comments are welcome, I may be a bit delayed answering them this week since I need to get the next video ready before I go off for a few days midweek for a conference, but I will get to them. If you enjoyed the video, hit the like button, share it with others, and don’t forget to subscribe for alerts for new videos. Thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next time!

The Anthropic Principle and Super Intelligence
---
  
2016-06-10  
https://youtu.be/OUf-QXDJgF8  

---

This was an unplanned video and the first time we’ve left the scheduled queue in a while but I felt there were some topics we either didn’t cover or didn’t cover in sufficient details in the last few videos, which formed a loose trilogy, and were themselves meant to answer some questions we’d be raising in other videos but had to skim past. 

There’s also some channel updates this week, so while the material today is going to be presented in as reasonably complete and standalone fashion as possible this is probably not the best video to begin with if this is your first visit to the channel and you probably ought to click on the video link to go back to the original video in this set and start there. 

If you’re sticking around anyway, you probably should turn on the closed caption subtitles, as my voice takes a bit of getting used to and the subtitles help in the meantime. 

Okay our two topics today, which are mostly unrelated but were both connected to our previous set of topics, are the Anthropic Principle and Super-Intelligence. 

The latter is our main focus but I wanted to cover the Anthropic Principle first because while I’ve touched on it briefly in the recent videos I didn’t go into much detail because I didn’t want to distract from the topics that descend from the Anthropic Principle by sidetracking onto it. 

Mostly this is because the Anthropic Principle is itself a fairly difficult concept to cover for a variety of reasons. 

First it is a bit conceptually tricky. 

Second the popular examples people use tend to really predispose people to bias on it. 

And third, it is actually rather hazily defined as a concept. 

All of which makes for a lot of confusion, because people have a tendency to look for something incredibly deep and profound in the Anthropic Principle, which I suppose there is, but much like it’s counterpart, the Copernican Principle or its more modern and generalized form, the Mediocrity Principle, it’s really about how you look at problems when you don’t know much and are encountering apparent improbabilities. 

For the Copernican Principle the example is how we are not the center of the Universe, but there are three popular one for the Anthropic Principle. 

The first is the Doomsday Argument, which created by the same fellow who coined the term Anthropic Principle, Cosmologist Brandon Carter, whose variation of the Anthropic Principle is often called the Weak Anthropic Principle. 

The Second is the Simulation Hypothesis, created by philosopher Nick Bostrom who has done a lot of the work refining the Anthropic Principle, and the third is the Fine Tuned Universe concept, popularized by Cosmologists John Barrow and Frank Tipler in there book the Anthropic Cosmological Principle. 

These are great examples for increasing attention on the topic since they may be summed as basically arguing when the world will end, if we ourselves are real or simulations, and if there is a God. 

Needless to say that captures attention but it’s almost guaranteed to upset folks and bias them on the subject. 

I prefer much more mundane and down to earth examples, but they can be a bit boring, and we covered two of those, Doomsday argument and Simulation Hypothesis, as extensions of the Fermi Paradox so the Anthropic Principle itself wasn’t a main interest at the time. 

I was covering those topics in their own right and in terms of how they fit inside the spectrum of proposed solutions to the Fermi Paradox, not how they descend from the Anthropic Principle. 

Also as I mentioned it’s a bit of hazy concept too. 

Carter has said he regrets giving it that name, it’s a bit misleading since Anthropic means human-centered and that’s not the point, it might be better called the Observer or Egocentric Principle in contrast to the Mediocrity Principle. 

On top of that it was hazily defined initially so many variants exist, Nick Bostrom says he cataloged 30 distinct versions and many were really very off concept. 

Since there is no official definition I have the option of trying to present them all, or at least all the ones with a semi-legitimate claim, which would be needlessly time-consuming, or just present what I view as the proper definition in the context we’ve been using, so that is what I will do, and then we will move on to discuss super-intelligence. 

We apply the Mediocrity and Anthropic Principles all the time at a daily level without even thinking about it, but they’re really about assumptions that should be drawn to make decisions when you don’t know much so the examples used tend to set up virtually no knowledge of the event, and neither view is necessarily going to produce different or more correct final assumptions. 

Here’s two examples of them in mundane life, and in both I think you’ll say ‘no duh, this is obvious’. 

Example #1: Standing in a room I meet twenty people and am informed of their job. 

Ten of them give me fairly broadly random answers like policeman or factory worker or hotel maid or bartender and the like, but ten of them tell me they are insurance salesman. 

What should I conclude from this? 

Now under either Mediocrity or Anthropic Principles I have the option of assuming that I just happened to randomly meet 10 insurance salesman out of a sample of 20 with no underlying cause for the weird distribution, it isn’t that uncommon of a job after all, but they can also both contemplate that there was an underlying cause for the distribution. 

In fact a bunch of you have probably already jumped ahead and concluded I am probably at hotel that is hosting a convention for insurance salesman, and that I, the observer, might be one myself. 

Thus simultaneously explaining the high distribution of the insurance salesmen and my reason for being there to observe it. 

The Mediocrity Principle is mostly about realizing it is convention, whereas the Anthropic Principle is mostly about why I was there to observe it. 

Same if I noticed some room had a hundred cans of corn in it, the mediocrity principle would be focused on places where we would expect that, like a grocery store or survival bunker, while the Anthropic Principle is about why I personally am observing this strange thing, because I’m grocery shopping or visiting a friend who is a survivalist. 

That’s why I said it might be better called the Egocentric Principle instead of the Anthropic Principle. 

Now this doesn’t seem like a terribly profound concept and actually seems rather silly and trivial, something that seems that way for a lot of mathematical, philosophical, and scientific core concepts or assumptions. 

But it’s when you’re operating with very little information that it sticks out because it comes down to decision making. 

So let’s highlight that with example #2. 

Example #2: I have been handed many sheets of paper each having a list of ten movies on them and the heading ‘favorite films’. 

Each of the lists is unique but there are many similarities and far too many for me to think it very likely this represents a random distribution of films, or even popular films. 

How should I proceed? 

The Mediocrity approach would be to look at those similarities and to assume they are probably a random sample of a fairly mundane and mediocre nature from the group of people who wrote them, and that those folks represent a subset of humanity that is inclined to those films. 

The Anthropic approach would be to assume that my presence here to see those lists in the first place is indicative and I would jot down my own list of ten favorites believing that it will help me draw conclusions. 

And depending on the actual circumstances one of these approaches is more likely to be a good path. 

For instance on this channel I often get asked in the comments section what my favorite films or TV shows or books are and no surprise that when I list them I often get replies that many of those are their own favorites. 

And it is no surprise, I am a science fiction fan and so is a lot of the audience and that is very related to the channel. 

So my ability to observe those list of favorites, or your ability to observe them now, is indeed very related to your existence. 

Alternatively if we polled this channel for favorite foods we wouldn’t really expect to see abnormally high preferences in relation to the human population as a whole, though it might skew by geographic region or other factors. 

To underscore it, these two concepts are not in opposition, and you use them all the time, but circumstances tend to dictate which is good for what and reduce it to a simple and common mental exercise. 

And a bit of boring one. 

When we know very little and pick topics like the End of the World or if God Exists or if you might actually be a simulation on a computer it can provoke deeper interest to contemplate the idea but also tends to obscure what is a both simple and profound tool for making decisions. 

To segue way into our second and main topic for today, Super-Intelligence, let me make a comparison to what is known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect or Curve. 

If we plot a person’s confidence on a subject or problem against what they know about it we get this sort of double hump. 

Initially confidence is low but rises steeply, then drops off as they learn more before rising again. 

Now I often call this first curve’s top the “Peak of Mount Stupid” and it does seem to be a popular vacation spot, probably one we are all guilty of pitching our tent at on a regular basis. 

However I raise it now to note more how we make decisions. 

Often we can make a very confident decision off very little information and grow less confident as we learn more though eventually learn enough to be more confident in that decision. 

Sometimes learning more can even make us double-guess correct conclusions and make bad ones, but that’s not my point here. 

I keep stressing that the Anthropic Principle is mostly about decision making when you don’t know much, and its about making a decision you can be confident about. 

Not because you think it is very likely to be right, but rather because you think that based on what you know it was the best decision to make. 

If you get more info you can revise, but in the meantime you can decide and act knowing your decision was the right decision to make regardless of if it was wrong. 

If it’s twice as likely to be right as the options, it was the right pick, even if it was a tiny chance. 

If someone is about to roll a pair of dice and you have to guess the sum, you should say 7, not 2 or 12, and certainly not 1 or 100, since 7 is most likely and 2 and 12 least likely and 1 and 100 would seem to be impossible. 

If you later learn that those were not six-sided cubic dice, or aren’t labeled 1-6, or that they are both but weighted to land on sixes a lot, you revise accordingly. 

Now the Dunning-Kruger Curve is applicable to humans when we think about super-intelligence too because it’s important to understand that we all hang out on Mount Stupid because there’s just only so much time in our lives to learn things and only so much interest or need to encourage us to learn various topics. 

And those topics can include things like being a good conversationalist or a convincing speaker. 

Those are learned skills, same as throwing a ball or performing a calculation. 

A super-intelligence, of any of the three forms we’ll be looking at, ought to have a lot more of those skills and so as we approach these notions it’s a good idea to remove the fictional bias we have of thinking of some computer brain or superhuman as displaying all the personal charm of an ice cube tray. 

I mentioned this notion before the Apocalypse How video, that in all probability an artificial intelligence bent on world domination is a lot less likely to do it with legions of killer robots and nukes and probably a lot more likely to be swept into power by popular vote. 

Yes it might use that it can be more impartial and knowledgeable as a selling point but I would genuinely expect a super-intelligence, regardless of its providence, be it a computer mind or a transhuman, to absolutely ooze charisma and charm. 

But what is Super-Intelligence? 

Well Nick Bostrom breaks into 3 loose categories and I’ll borrow his: 1. 

Speed Super-intelligence – Something we discussed before in the Transhumanism video, essentially where the enhanced intelligence is simply in the form of thinking faster. 

This is often the easiest for people to visualize since it is sort of like if the world around you simply slowed down. 

In Computer terms it’s a faster processor. 

2. 

Collective Super-Intelligence – This is probably the type of super-intelligence we’re most familiar with and sort of already have a type of, though it could vary from a very loose collective, like a tribe with specialized skill sets, scaling all the way up to a civilization, or a group of specialists advancing their field together, to more direct high bandwidth collectives where you might argue there’s only one mind and the individuals are more like organs of a body or lobes of the group brain. 

In computer terms this would be multiple processors or networked computers. 

3. 

Quality Super-Intelligence, our last category, is the hardest to visualize except by comparison, in that here we’re not talking about adding faster processors or more processors in parallel but in some way arguable more the software angle. 

A cat with a faster mind probably isn’t going to discover calculus, nor would a hundred cats all linked up in parallel. 

In human terms one trained and talented scientist or artist is going to produce more insights or deeper art in their normal career than one random person who has ten subjective lifetimes to look at the problem or ten random people put together in room as a committee. 

Using that Dunning Kruger Effect one more time, we’d expect the either of these three types to occupy Mount Stupid a lot less, since Speed Super-Intelligence has a lot more time to learn things in, subjectively, and can research topics in detail a lot faster. 

Collective Super-Intelligence just has the two heads are better than one advantage, meaning talking to it would be akin to asking a room full of random people about something instead of just one random person, and Quality Super-Intelligence is akin to asking an expert rather than a random person. 

Now as I said we did talk about Speed Super-Intelligence back in the Transhumanism video and we’ll just briefly mention the highlights of that and some new stuff relevant to it today. 

A speed super-intelligence is basically where you’re taking a human brain and speeding it up, either by miniaturizing it so signals move faster or replacing the existing biology with mechanisms that transmit faster. 

Human though basically moves at the speed of sound or slower, whereas you could presumably ramp that all the way up to the speed of light which is some millions of times faster. 

From a practical standpoint you just live longer in a Universe where time seems to move past much slower, your subjective time is running way faster. 

You’re not smarter, but you’ve got a lot more time to reply to comments or react to events or think about things. 

Of course since your mind is wired to receive information from your eyes and ears and so on at a certain speed and bandwidth you’ve got to modify that person rather extensively to be able to, for instance, mentally connect to the internet and be able to chat with other accelerated individuals by the equivalent of telepathy, presumably radio communication, and a lot of times we’d assume they abandon a natural body or use it as just one piece of their existence since it will be too slow, even if we replace it with some cyborg chassis that can move at bullet speed. 

You’d sort of expect these folks would want to move in together too since living in the same building with other accelerated individuals means no time lag on talking, and while we don’t even notice the fraction of a second it takes a signal to cross the planet, for them even a phone call to someone in the town next door might feel like it would be for us trying to talk to astronauts on Mars where there’s several minutes of lag time after you say something before the other guy here’s it and just as much before you get their response. 

We do carry on conversations with long lag by email for instance, often even when we know we can dial the phone a lot faster than we can type the reply and get an instant answer, but it isn’t the way we like to chat. 

Now the second category, Collective Super-Intelligence, is in some ways something you are already familiar with. 

Group action effectively creates a new entity, very literally if we’re talking about multi-cellular life or colony organisms or even hive minds, and more metaphorically if we’re talking about teams or clubs or tribes or packs or herds. 

You and I both are part of multiple collective super-intelligences, albeit if fairly primitive ones in this light, but groups and civilizations themselves are essentially big problem solving entities. 

This is a very broad category then since it can range from existing human groups exchanging thought by low bandwidth speech up to something where we wired peoples brains together so closely that they might be better thought of as being hemispheres or lobes of some larger brain. 

From the two heads are better than one approach to the full blown hive mind or even more reintegrated equivalent to a multi-cellular organism with only one meaningful personality and identity. 

And this would contain the idea of the networked computer mind that explodes into consciousness at some critical mass, Google gone sentient as it were. 

Familiar concept, though I’d add a backwards case of this for contemplation before we move into the third category. 

We have all noted, in ourselves or in a friend, a tendency to wear different masks with different people or groups. 

Now that can indicate a certain amount of fakeness and fabrication to that person’s identity but I’m referring to the fairly mundane way many of change behaviors and even tone and mannerism around others. 

This can be a fairly deep transition too, in more than just surface detail. 

It can verge on an almost mild equivalent to multiple personality disorder and so I can imagine how an upgraded singular intelligence might actually break off fairly distinct bits to handle this or that task or interaction in a backwards case of collective intelligence or parallel processing, but is more of a software than hardware approach, sort of multitasking, multiple windows open, but in a more distinct way like when a computer’s processor does the job of a sound or video card rather than having separate devices for that. 

Using that Google analogy, since we’d often expect AI to spring from something like a search engine that had a lot interaction with tons of different users, I could imagine a huge AI that had tons of customized interfaces for dealing with certain user personalities or even on unique to each user. 

Now Speed Super-Intelligence lets you think faster and collective Super-intelligence let’s you put more minds on a problem and both are very handy things for problem solving but we’d say there is a type of intelligence that handles some problems in just a plain better way. 

In the way ten people might take years or forever to figure out the answer to something when one person of the right mind can walk in and just figure it out with ease, or how one person might spend years trying to write a decent book and other could churn out a superior volume in a few weeks. 

This is a very hazy an indistinct type of intelligence and we call it Quality Intelligence. 

And I use the analogy that it essentially a software thing. 

Partially because I tend to be kind of dubious on the idea of genius to begin with. 

I regard intelligence levels among humans, as well as genius and talent, as mostly matters of development and focus, both in the software sense of experiences and knowledge and a bit of a muscle analogy that you’ve got to exercise the brain to build and keep all those neural connections. 

There are several competing theories for human intelligence, Gardenr’s theory of multiple intelligence that breaks it down into categories like special, linguistic, logical-mathematical, interpersonal and a few others is a popular one. 

There’s also Sternberg’s Triarchic Intelligence, or Successful Intelligence, that breaks it into Analytic, Creative, and Practical Intelligence. 

We’ve also got Fluid Intelligence versus Crystalized Intelligence that looks at Fluid Intelligence as someone’s problem solving skills independent of their knowledge whereas Crystallized Intelligence is what handles skills and experience, and there are at least a dozen others. 

I am not personally aware of any of them being considered by the experts on this subject as a strong lead candidate, and I suspect that besides us just not knowing enough yet that we also need to mistrust some of the conclusions as possibly tainted by bias. 

Both in the sense that the people doing the research are likely to assume they are intelligent, with good cause but possible bias as a result, and the understandable tendency for us to want everyone to be intelligent in their own way. 

I’ve no idea how much either bias effects conclusions, hopefully minimally but it certainly biases us non-experts and we need to be cautious when thinking about Quality Intelligence to keep in mind that it might be in whole or part just things we could chalk up to faster processor or more processors or more memory and knowledge and experience and better methodology, or software, developed in the process. 

Ya know you might flick on some computer megabrain who can figure things out we can’t even with more time or people thrown at the problem and it might just turn around and explain its reasoning and we slap ourselves on the forehead and go ‘That is so obvious’ and can then replicate the same feats of intellect albeit slower or needing more heads involved. 

Or it might be that we’d genuinely need or memories expanded so we could think about a lot more things at once, we’re pretty good multi-taskers but there is an actual limit to how many things we can think about or keep track of at once and being able to tinker with that might be the single biggest improvement to intelligence from a quality perspective. 

Okay that’s where we’ll wrap that up, and move into the channel update. 

I’ve got the date up on the screen when I did this so if that is a long while ago or if you’re brand new to the channel you can probably jump ship here, if the latter I suggest going back and watching that trio of recent vids I mentioned and you can click on the box to go to that now, or you can try out these other video playlists. 

In terms of announcements, as the regular viewers know I missed last week’s video, got rather busy with other matters but it broke our weekly schedule that I’d held to for 15 weeks straight. 

I’m rather surprised I went that long uninterrupted and I’ve always said I didn’t expect to keep up that pace though I’ve no intent of returning to the once a month or even less frequent posting form before then. 

Part of the reason though was also that I’ve been kicking around changes to the channel. 

I mentioned some months back that I still didn’t really know where the channel was going and I regret to say I still don’t, especially in light of the wave of copyright claims I’ve been getting hit with, all of which so far I’ve won but those have been getting more numerous and exhausting to deal with. 

So I’ve been pondering starting a website or changing the channel name to something besides my own or asking for some help from the audience since there’s a ton of skill kicking around the channel, and quite a few generous offers to do everything from voice-overs to helping out with the graphics to admin-ing a forum, and I haven’t really figured out the right method yet. 

Heck I still haven’t figured our Reddit. 

I did, after some of the first copyrights claims slapped ads on to my videos and I got tired of Youtube promising all sorts of new tools if I did so myself, put adds on the front of the videos, those should just be those little banner ads and I always leave the lower third of the video fairly content free to make room for subtitles anyway. 

And there is also now a Patreon account for the channel and I’ll leave the link in the video description but I’m still not really sure how to use that. 

Patreon suggests having rewards for patrons but the only one I can think of is just offering to include them in the credits at the end, which normally just has me listed as the sole production credit followed by the list of songs and artists used so adding in the donors, assuming they want that, seems a pretty fair thing and would fit in well if I start needing to add to those credits to also thank folks who are volunteering art to use in the videos or admin-ing a forum or whatever. 

Thing is at the moment I genuinely have no idea what the right path is and researching it further just takes time away from making videos, not too mention answering questions and comments – which I not only consider a necessary and proper addition to the videos but happen to enjoy. 

I should probably add though that the sheer volume of questions that comes in these days which will presumably only grow is making it harder for me to reply to a lot of them so while in the past I usually would answer the same question from someone else I’d already answered below I’d encourage folks to scan those comments before asking, in case I already answered it, or to reply to them and let them know I already had. 

That’s another reason I’m pondering some sort of website or forum, I’d really like to be able to add FAQs onto videos or pin up diagrams or images contained in them or that I wished I’d added, or to be able add on some quick follow up that was less scripted and graphic intensive, B-sides as it were, if I felt something got left out or just wanted to go into more detail on something. 

I’ve also always wanted to encourage other people to try their hand at making videos, it’s a wonderful medium with not too sharp of a learning curve, and I like the idea of being able to give people a bit of jumpstart on that or help those with some useful production or art skills to hook up together on projects. 

I’d love to snatch a few such individuals myself and doubtless will but when you see talent I think you’ve got an obligation to help them get their own projects rolling not just lash them to your own and suck the energy out of them. 

But again as I said I’m not really sure what the best route on all this is, and since we’ve just been talking about collective intelligence I’d greatly appreciate hearing some ideas down in the comments below. 

You can private message me if your prefer but I’d rather mostly do it in the comments so we can get group feedback, plus Youtube’s internal private message system seems to either lose messages or delay notification, so its almost easier to just look me up on Facebook, though I should probably open up a separate FB account for the channel too. 

There’s no Twitter, I probably should figure out how to use that too. 

So again at this time I need ideas for what should be done as much as I need help actually doing it, if you’ve got some ideas or want to volunteer your time let me know. 

We’ve got such a great community here that’s been developing in recent months that I hate the idea of not doing something fun and interesting with it. 

Obviously as things develop I’ll mention it in the videos for now, as with last time I’m not sure if there will be a video next week or another skip so I won’t announce which will be up next or do a poll on that, but I am still aiming for primarily once-a-week production with releases on Fridays and once I pick a direction and implement it the pace should return to that. 

That’s it for now, hope you enjoyed the video, thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next time.

The Doomsday Argument
---
  
2016-05-27  
https://youtu.be/NQIB3-EtL1w  

---

Today we’ll be looking at the Doomsday Argument, a probability based argument that predicts the end of humanity sometime in the next few thousand years. 

Also, since it applies to any alien civilizations, how this Argument came to be seen as one of the possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox. 

The apparent contradiction between just how old and big the Universe is and the seeming absence of any other intelligent life besides ourselves. 

There’s more than one Doomsday Argument, but today we are looking at the version known as the Carter Catastrophe. 

We’ll be looking at it is stating, how it came about, what is claims and why, and its strengths and weaknesses. 

Also this video is something of a companion video to last week’s episode on the Simulation Hypothesis and forms a loose trilogy with the video on Transhumanism and Immortality, so you might want watch those first though it isn’t absolutely necessary. 

As is often the case in these videos I’ll be using some more obscure terms at times so coupled to my speech impediment I’d suggest you turn on the closed caption subtitles now. 

Also, since we will be talking about the Fermi Paradox, one of the major interests on this channel, you will occasionally see video links pop up on the screen like we have now, where we discussed some topic in more detail. 

Clicking on those just pauses this video and opens that in a new window. 

Now the Doomsday Argument is one of those concepts most people hate, what’s interesting is that their reasons for doing so are often quite different and often fairly logically unsound. 

There’s a kneejerk response to the concept a lot of times simply because it is a Doomsday Scenario and it’s also statistical, but I think it is because people often do a bad job explaining it and often cite related concepts instead the actual argument and the assumptions it rests on. 

It is also a very hard one to explain the statistical concept on in an intuitive fashion, as I just found out myself trying to craft this script. 

It’s incredibly easy to explain to anyone with a background in Bayesian analysis, trying to circumvent that led to a few drafts where I realized I’d spent about 20 minutes explaining statistics before even stating the basis of the argument, then another 10 explaining the Sleeping Beauty Problem, which is a somewhat creepy thought experiment involving doping a young lady up with sleeping pills and mind altering drugs. 

You knock her out, wake up, ask her a question, flip a coin, and based on the results drug her up with some memory erasing agent and wake her again. 

Now there’s a more disturbing version of that thought problem that Nick Bostorm thought up, and for that matter I developed a pretty morbid one involving clones about a decade back, unsurprisingly while I was stationed in a warzone, which eerily resembles a recent Doctor Who episode called ‘Heaven Sent’, one of Steven Moffat’s best scripts in my opinion, but we won’t be looking at either of those today. 

Now the Sleeping Beauty Problem is very relevant to the Doomsday Argument but we’ll be mostly bypassing it today, just covering it briefly near the end, and I mention it because what it also reminded me of was that he had developed what I think is probably one of the most intuitively clear explanations of the Doomsday Argument so I am going to borrow his with some minor modifications to update it, and I will link his write-up on the matter in the video description below. 

Bostrom’s also very well known for the Anthropic Principle, which is very heavily tied into Doomsday Argument, but another fellow who is linked up with that concept and actually formally named it is Brandon Carter, from who the Doomsday Argument’s Alternate name, the Carter Catastrophe, gets its name. 

Carter is not a philosopher like Bostrom, he’s a theoretical physicist and got his doctorate under the same professor as Stephen Hawking did the year before, and the two developed quite a lot of black hole and general relativity concepts together with some others. 

So Carter developed the Anthropic Principle and in 1983 did a presentation on the Doomsday argument, as a thought experiment, he never published it but it stirred up a lot of thought on the matter and a lot of future papers. 

Let me lay out the concept with this thought experiment, again borrowing heavily form Bostrom’s explanation. 

You have been placed in a building with a hundred identical rooms without windows, just a door and you’re locked inside. 

You find a note telling you that there are 100 such rooms with a person in each one. 

It also says that each door, on the outside that you can’t see, has been painted either red or blue. 

And that you must guess correctly and only get one guess. 

Now at this point you don’t know anything but that, and you’ve got a coin in your pocket and figure you might as well flip it to decide, because there’s a 50/50 chance it will be right. 

Even if the number of doors painted each color isn’t the same. 

Even if 90 doors are blue and only ten red, even if all the doors are just one color. 

Your coin has a 50/50 chance of being right and is the best odds for success you’ve got. 

Whichever color your door is, you’ve got a 50/50 chance of being right with the coin flip. 

Now another note is slipped under the door and it tells you that, indeed, 90 doors are blue and 10 are red. 

This is new information, you don’t know what your door is but if you choose to assume you yourself are a random sample of the rooms, we’ll call this the self-sampling assumption, then you should figure there’s a 90% chance your door is blue and a 10% chance it is red. 

Such being the case, by selecting blue you have 90% chance of being right and while the coin flip would still give you a 50% chance, it would seem logical to pick blue on that 90% chance offered by the self-sampling assumption, that you yourself are a random sample of the 100 observers. 

Okay now let’s switch things up, one hundred rooms again but this time they have a number outside, 1-100. 

This time your note tells you that they took a list of 110 people and you were placed in this room after they, the people doing this, flipped a coin. 

They will not tell you what the result was or what your room number is, but that on tails they took the first 100 people on the list and placed one person in each room, and on heads they took the last 10 people on the list and placed a person in each of the first ten rooms, 1-10. 

You are asked to guess if there are 10 people or 100. 

So now you know, if it came up heads you must be in rooms 1-10. 

You are after all here. 

If it came up tails then you could be in any of the hundred rooms. 

It would seem coin flip odds there are 10 or 100 people and it would initially seem flipping a coin yourself was the logical move. 

And indeed, once again that offers a 50/50 chance of being right based on what you know. 

Yet at the same time if there are 110 people on that list, wouldn’t it seem more likely you were one of the 100, not one of 10? 

100 being 91% of 110, isn’t there arguably a 91% chance you are one of the 100, and only a 9% chance of being one of the 10? 

If you assume you were randomly picked off that list of 110 than simply being here yourself indicates it is more likely you are one of the 100, we’ll call that Self-Indication Assumption. 

There is, incidentally, a huge and constant battle between supporters of these two assumptions, SSA and SIA. 

But let’s say I get my door open somehow and can see the number 7 on the outside, but before I can do anything else I’m chased back into my room by a monster and new note is passed under saying ‘decide now, was the coin heads, 10 people, or tails, 100 people’. 

Okay, I have a new piece of information. 

I am in room 7. 

What does this tell us? 

I mean if I’m part of the hundred I could still be in room 7, someone had to be, but if I was one of 10 I could obviously be too. 

So how did I get here, was there a 50% chance that it came up heads, 10 people, and a 1 in 10 chance I am in room 7, or a 50% chance it came up tails, 100 people, and a 1% chance I am in room 7? 

Well using Bayes Thereom we can crank that out real quick, and this time it will tell me there’s a 9% chance I am part of 100, and a 91% chance I am part of the 10. 

The exact opposite odds I get if I assumed I was more likely to have been part of the 100 on the list of 110. 

Now before we proceed I want you to take a moment to decide how you feel on this. 

Do you think, by seeing the #7 on the door, that we should be assuming we are probably in the 10, or do you think that’s flawed? 

It’s not a trick question or anything. 

I just want you decide if you feel seeing door #7 makes it more likely you are 1 of 10, and keep your answer in mind. 

Okay, let’s step this over to the Doomsday Argument now. 

If you’ve been following the Fermi Paradox videos then you might remember one of our categories of solutions was that idea that high-tech alien civilizations are rare because they kill themselves off, and we looked at a lot of those extinction scenarios in the Fermi Paradox Apocalypse How video. 

We’ll call this general set of scenarios the Doom Soon group, and for our purposes today it doesn’t matter what causes the apocalypse anymore than it matters how you got stuck on that list of 110 or where the building actually is. 

We’ve also explored on this channel the concepts of colonizing our solar system and our galaxy and of building giant megastructures and dyson spheres and how in such setups you’d expect immense populations where more people are born every day then ever lived so far, and how such civilizations could go on for billions or trillions of years or even longer, outliving even the stars. 

Though in the end time and entropy catch up to you and your civilization ends. 

We’ll call this the Doom Late group. 

In the Doom Soon group, if you sat down every person who ever lived and handed them a numbered card based on when they were born the Adam and Eve get #1 and #2 and based on our most recent estimates you and I would be getting one just over 100 billion, and the last man born would get, say, 1 trillion. 

In the Doom Late scenario we give out the same cards and our actual number is going to be disgustingly high, especially if we throw in the Whole Brain Emulation folks operating under the Landauer Limit we discussed in the last couple videos, in that you can get a total number of human lifetimes out of a galaxy well in excess of a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion people. 

But for simplicity I’ll just go with a million trillion, or a quintillion people, shrinking it by about 30 orders of magnitude, the difference between a grapefruit’s mass and our sun’s. 

So Doom Soon, about a trillion people will ever live, and we’re about a tenth of the way through that. 

Doom Late, way more than a million trillion will have lived, and we’d be among the tiny, tiny, tiny fraction that born first. 

Conceptually, Doom Soon, with its trillion people, is like being one of the ten people in our second, numbered door example. 

And Doom Late corresponds to our 100 people in that same example. 

And I already told you that our estimates put you in at about #100 billion on birth order. 

That corresponds to stepping out to see the #7 on your door. 

You are about number #100 billion, so am I, we’ve all stepped out and seen a low number on our door. 

I asked you a little while ago how you felt about seeing door #7, if you felt that made it more likely you were part of that 10 room group than the 100 room group. 

If you did feel that was sound reasoning, and it’s pretty solid, then when you realize you are #100 billion in human race it should seem, on the face of it, that you are way more likely to be part of the Doom Soon group of a round a trillion not the Doom Late group of a million trillion and way more. 

I mean in one case it’s like finding out that for a conference of ten people you randomly arrived first, and in the other, I would say it would be like finding out that you randomly arrived first in an entire stadium except that barely even begins to describe the level of improbability of having been born this early in even the most conservatively small interstellar civilizations. 

That would be more akin to the odds winning the lottery several weeks in a row. 

Only you didn’t win, you kind of lost. 

Most of us would rather have been born nowadays then in ancient times when life was a lot harder and a lot shorter on average. 

And as we discussed in the Transhumanism and Immortality video, and how most of us who are techno-optimists tend to feel, being born further ahead in time would probably be better. 

That was one of our lines of reasoning against the Simulation Hypothesis last time, where we were faced with similar super huge odds that faced us with the high improbability we are the people actually lived through modern times rather than being Ancestor Simulation, that advanced civilizations might feel it was unethical to subjects us to these primitive and harsh modern times. 

But keep this in mind, in the Doom Late Group, you are trying to argue that of all the people in their near endless trillions who will ever live you and I just happened by freak luck to have been born in that first fraction of that first trillion. 

Whereas in the Doom Soon Group we’re not even arguing we’re in the first half. 

A lot of times on the Doomsday Argument, when people roll through the math and get that 1-2 trillion figure, they misinterpret that as meaning that is how many people will live, when what it is actually saying is that the most people who could live before the odds start getting ridiculous, the odds favor it would happen a lot sooner, probably in the next 100 billion people since there have been 100 billion so far, and at current birth rates of 131 million a year, that would be about the 28th century, sooner if the birth rate went up. 

Now while that’s sinking in let me walk you through a statistical example. 

Some groups of experts has calculated that there’s a 1% chance of us all being killed each year. 

For our purposes, doesn’t matter which, it could be nuclear war, a lot of people thought 1% would have been generous during the Cold War. 

Asteroids or some new doomsday device that got the diagram leaked all over the internet and can be built by anyone with decent skill and a few thousands bucks, or some designer virus or plague, ebola’s big brother. 

Doesn’t matter. 

Their spokesman goes before a congressional committee and say “1%, every year, a 1% chance we’ll be dead each year.” So the oversight committee chair says, “Hey wait, are you telling me there’s a 1% chance we’re going to die every year? 

That means there’s a 50/50 chance we’ll all be dead in 50 years.” And another committee person says, “And either way we’ll be dead in a century. 

1% a year, 100 years, gone.” Now at this point the testifying expert says, “No sir, I’m saying there’s a fifty-fifty chance of this happening in about the next 70 years, odds don’t add up that way. 

There’s a 99% chance, or .99 chance, of us surviving every year so the odds of us surviving 50 years wouldn’t be 50%, it would be .99^50, or 60.5%, it doesn’t drop to 50% for 69 years, .99^69 is about 50%, so 69 call it 70 years, a whole human lifetime. 

Now in full 100 years it’s .99^100, or .366, or 36.6% we’ll still be alive and 63.4% we’ll be dead, not 100%, it will never be 100%.” “Well I’m a gambling man.” Says one of the committee, “How long before it drops to just 1%?” “Well that would be logarithm in base .99 of .01, which would be about 458 years. 

It drops to 1 in 1000, or .001, in log base .99 of .001 687, and if you want lottery odds of 1 in 10 million sir, even that would only be 1600 years.” We have a statistical concept for degree of belief, or certainty. 

It’s like when you see all those polls that say something like 52-48% for some pair of candidates and at the bottom it says +/-3%. 

Someone’s says the one candidate is up 4 points, but they’re actually in a statistical tie. 

Because they could be separated as much as 55-45 or it could got the other way and be as low as 49-51. 

But it could also be outside that window, that margin, for error. 

Usually we use a 95% confidence level for such margins, meaning 19 out of 20 times the result will be in that 3% window, but 1 in 20 it won’t be. 

95% is a pretty common pick, and is one of the reason on many older Doomsday argument write-ups you’d see 1.2 trillion, they were using an older estimate for humans who had ever lived of 60 billion, newer estimate is 108 billion, and multiplying 60 by 20 would give you 1.2 trillion. 

In our last example there, the 1% a year chance, to get up to 95% where there’s only be a 5% chance we’d still be alive, would take 300 years. 

I could say I was 95% certain we’d be dead in 300 years. 

Doesn’t mean we have that long. 

Could be shorter, could be longer, but not a lot longer because the odds of survival keep plummeting, going from 1 in 2 in 70 years to 1 in 20 in 300 years to 1 in 100 in 460 years to 1 in 1000 in 700 years and only 1 in million in 1600 years. 

If I asked most people if they thought there was a 1% chance we’d kill ourselves off in the next year, I’d wager I’d get about an even mix of folks who nodded and said that was about right with folks who thought it was being generous and ones who thought it was pessimistic on our survival. 

So coupled to the Doomsday Argument that you were randomly born in time and its improbably you were born very early, this is a pretty strong probabilistic argument. 

You weren’t born early, you didn’t get bad luck to born at the very dawn of mankind because it won’t sprawl out into an empire over a billion suns lasting for billions of years. 

You were probably born right around the middle of the group, maybe tilted a bit early, maybe a bit late, but not improbably so, and the end is coming not that long off. 

Now if you picked that seeing door #7 meant you were probably one of ten people and not a hundred, from earlier, that doesn’t mean you are stuck with the Doomsday Argument. 

And most people hate the Doomsday Argument, I do, but if you dislike it is important to make sure your reasoning is on solid footing, we don’t discard a logical sound premise because it is distasteful and it is pretty logical sound. 

Fortunately there are counter-arguments, many of them, some good, some bad, some close to home, we’ll just cover a few. 

For instance, in the Transhumanism video we are constantly talking about post-human states and immortality too. 

You could argue post-human isn’t human, that cyborgs or digital people or some souped up Strong AI planet sized computer brain is not a human, I’d argue otherwise but it’s not a bad notion, and so the Doomsday Argument would hold even though we kept on going in a way after that. 

And with genuine immortality, since there are only finite resources, birth rates could drop to a trickle or stop entirely as those immortals decided they wanted to keep all remaining matter and energy for their own continued existence, and only replace the few rare deaths or not even that, just dividing up the deceased’s stockpiles for themselves, so they could keep going even longer. 

The flip side of that, you could say that if a transhuman or post-human is a human, then maybe our 108 billion estimate for people born thus far is being unfair, and we are excluding a lot of proto-humans or even other primates and dolphins and elephants or maybe even wider, back to first critters, many millions if not billions of extra years for births and including a lot more from each year too. 

Also, as I’ve indicated, the Anthropic Principle, the Doomsday Argument, and the Simulation Hypothesis are often linked up together, and for good reason. 

Consider the Simulation Hypothesis we discussed last time, inside that we don’t know our Birth Order, our real Birth Order, at all. 

Sure the original folks of the 21st century were ranked around 100 billion but for all we know we could be ancestor simulations running around the real year 4 Billion AD, keeping some last immortal company while he sticks around to watch the sun die, last dude still kicking around from the original 21st century and he keeps replaying it, and we’re not birth order 100 billion, we’re somewhere up in the gajillions and just don’t know it. 

We’re in his version of Groundhog day. 

We also don’t know that there will be a finite number of humans, we tend to assume so but at the same time most of us tend to think the Universe, I mean the whole thing, every place be it alternate universes or alternate dimensions or whatever, the whole grand shebang if you would, is infinite in size and duration. 

And if that were the case there would be an infinite number of places we could call home and if we had a way of getting there, you could have an infinite number of people. 

Counter-intuitively, like with the St. Petersburg Paradox, while an incredibly large number of humans as in the Doom Late Group would imply it was improbable we were born this early, an infinite number of people doesn’t make it improbable at all. 

If there’s an infinite number of us then you are genuinely as likely to be born whenever in the order. 

Another, and one a bit similar, goes back to the Self-Indication Assumption. 

Near the beginning, when I set up the reasoning that if you were on that list of 110 people, 10 of whom had even odds to be in 10 rooms and 100 of whom had even odds be in 100 rooms, says that you are far more likely to have been in that group of 100 people. 

And from that, if there are a ton of people, as in the Doom Late version with our trillions of trillions of people, you actually more likely to exist if there were a huge number of us, and so are more likely to exist in a universe in which there were a huge number of us, a Doom Late Universe, then in one in which few of us existed, the Doom Soon Universe. 

Yes it is statistically improbable to be born early in a Doom Late Universe, but it would also be statistically improbable to be born into a Doom Soon Universe not a Doom Late one, since there are so many more people you can be in that one, so it kinda cancels out. 

The self-indication assumption, SIA, along with the Self-Sampling Assumption, SSA, can be looked at a bit more clearly in the Sleeping Beauty Problem, as I mentioned earlier, but I’m opting not to cover that in detail today, because I’ve noticed I tend not to be great at explaining that. 

Probably because I tilt heavily towards SIA and am a ‘Thirder’, the enemy camp to the ‘Halfers’ on the Sleeping Beauty Problem, so I think I pre-bias my explanations. 

Also like Bostrom, who came up with a third position known as SSSA, Strong Self-Sampling Assumption, I feel SSA needs to take into account some other things. 

If you do spend some time on the Sleeping Beauty Problem, after you’ve absorbed it, try contemplate it for scenarios where the experiment doesn’t end after day two but just keeps going on, or where you are using tons of clones who all begin with the same memory of events prior to the experiment beginning. 

That can be a bit unnerving as you let your mind dwell on it though, as we just keep drugging someone and erasing their memory, demanding to know how likely they think this is the first time they’ve been woken up, or replace the scenario and question with tons of copies of a person and ask them how likely they think it is they are the original, especially if you’ve already gone through the simulation hypothesis video. 

Now there a plenty more objections but I’d rather you pushed the idea around in your head more before looking at those, the one’s I just covered relate to our recent topics so I wanted to cover them. 

And one more, we’ve talked a lot about the Fermi Paradox on this channel and this video is in that context but I haven’t mentioned it much in this video, and yet it does have a specific place. 

Now you’re probably assuming that’s as a solution, that the Doomsday Argument applies to alien civilizations as much as to ourselves and that suggest alien civilizations don’t last long and for that reason we don’t detect them. 

And that’s how it often does get viewed, but there is an additional implication. 

If you extend your Self-Sampling Assumption to include all intelligent beings, not just humans, which is to say you could have been born an alien, and we assume aliens are reasonably common, then our birth order number approach begins to fall apart, much as it did when I suggested including our pre-human ancestors or other smart animals like chimpanzees and dolphins. 

And that seems a nice fix since it means your birth wasn’t really improbable, there were probably clever aliens born billions of years ago. 

However, and especially in the context of the Dyson Dilemma, it still raises some Fermi Paradox problems because if we do assume intelligent civilizations are prone to expanding outward and building Dyson Swarms around everything, we’d still have to assume that since this hasn’t happened yet, and since we are actually quite early in the Universe’s Star Forming age which itself pretty short compared to the ages which could follow when life could still be going on, we would still be confronted with the freakish odds of being born this early, only now they are ratcheted up as we are not just considering all possible humans who will ever exist, but also possible intelligent being show will ever exist. 

So that’s where we’ll wrap it up for today, hopefully you’ve got some fun new concepts and ideas to mull around and better understand this argument, it’s strengths, and its flaws, and maybe have a new take on coin flips too. 

Speaking of which, there’s about coin flips odds I’ll be skipping next week’s video for time constraints. 

If I don’t it will probably be to do one of our shorter upcoming topics, if I do one of the longer ones, so I won’t say what the next video will be yet. 

If you haven’t already watched them, I’d suggest going back and watching the videos on Transhumanism and the Simulation Hypothesis, or you can try out any of these videos playlists. 

If you enjoyed the video, don’t forget to like it and share it, and subscribe to the channel for alerts when new videos come out. 

Questions and comments are welcome, I try to get to as many as I can, and as the channel’s been growing its attracted a lot of clever and bright commenters you can mull over the ideas with too. 

So I hope you enjoyed the video, thanks for watching, and we’ll see you next time!

The Simulation Hypothesis
---
  
2016-05-20  
https://youtu.be/nXIpR_agyl4  

---

So today we will be looking at the Simulation Hypothesis, also known as the Simulation Argument, the concept that we might be living inside one immense computer simulation. 

And this is going to be a fun trip because it’s a fascinating idea especially when applied to the Fermi Paradox, the apparent contradiction between the how old and big the universe is and how seemingly absent it is of any other intelligent life besides ourselves. 

So to do this we need to first do a basic introduction to the concept, sweep away some misconceptions about it, explore the concept a bit, then look at what it means in terms of the Fermi Paradox. 

Now the inventor of the idea. 

Nick Bostrom, actually does a wonderful job explaining this himself and in the video description below I’ve linked his original arguments and FAQ, which I’d strongly encourage you to browse if you have a chance. 

I will be mostly summarizing it here and I also won’t be going through the more formal arguments he offers there, though before I scare anyone off that with fears of formal logic, Bostrom does an excellent job presenting it in a very approachable fashion and I would certainly assess him as one of best modern scholars. 

Now the concept gets muddled a bit because Bostrom is actually discussing the specific notion of what is called Ancestor Simulations, which differs a bit from simulated realities in that it is specifically when you are simulating some piece of your civilizations past, or a close approximation thereof, as opposed to simulating entirely different civilizations or whole universes which might have different physical laws. 

Today we’ll be looking as much at those two alternatives as Ancestor Simulations themselves, but if you have difficulty picturing that notion just think of all the historical dramas or videogames we have. 

Often we intentionally add a fantastic aspect to them, but just as often all effort is made for historical accuracy and a very accurate one would be an Ancestor Simulation and it is quite easy to imagine why an advanced civilization might do such a thing. 

In recent videos we’ve spent a lot of time talking about how much processing power and how little energy might be needed to simulate a human mind, partially to lay groundwork for today, In those videos, most notably the recent video on Transhumanism, I mentioned the Landauer Limit, the apparent absolute minimum energy at any given temperature to flip a bit, or essentially the absolute minimum cost to perform calculations, and our best current guesses at how much computing power we need to simulate a human mind, called whole brain emulation. 

I won’t repeat that now, you can click on that video link if you want more details on the concept, but we found out that even at the relatively high temperature you and I live at, as compared to cold deep space, you could hypothetically run a million human minds for the same energy needed to run a light bulb. 

Now obviously achieving that efficiency would take a lot of improvements in modern technology, and at the same time if we are talking about ourselves as the simulations we have no idea what the physical laws of our simulators are bound by let alone the temperature they are running us at, but if we are talking about it just in terms of a more technologically advanced version of our own civilization interested in running a near perfect ancestor simulation of us now, with our 7 billion people, they could conceivably do that for as little as a megawatt. 

Which in terms of current power cost would translate as a bit over $100 an hour, or about a million dollars a year. 

Now ignoring that something like fusion reactors might make that a great deal cheaper, something we’ve looked at on this channel before, it is not hard to imagine at all that we might run such a whole planet simulation or indeed many hundreds or thousands of them simply for entertainment purposes alone. 

Now in the 1980s and 1990s we saw an great interest in virtual reality, which probably helped give rise to the Simulation Argument in the early 2000’s, and we also saw about then the takeoff of Reality TV shows, which I think all by themselves represent strong evidence in favor of the concept. 

Some of you may be familiar with older philosophical concepts like the Brain in a Vat, as well as general thought experiments about how we can know if everything around us is real or just a dream. 

You might wonder if Bostrom’s notion is anything new or just a modern flavor on those old concepts and my mention there of evidence, in regard to reality TV shows, is a big part of that. 

The simulation hypothesis is presenting this concept from the perspective that there are things which could be interpreted as evidence that we are in such an Ancestor Simulation or that such things are clearly possible. 

Bostrom presents us basically three scenarios for the future, one’s that will feel pretty familiar to those of you who have seen the Fermi Paradox Compendium video where we contemplated ways in which a civilization might continue after it reached our current technological level. 

Those are, to paraphrase: 1. 

That civilizations go extinct before acquiring the necessary technology to do ancestor simulations, or that they turn out not be possible. 

2. 

That civilizations who can perform ancestor simulations do not wish to do so. 

3. 

That they can do ancestor simulations and choose to do so. 

In that first option, civilizations simply ceases to exist, since we appear to have established that such simulations are most likely possible. 

We’ve looked at those apocalyptic scenarios before and will look at more of them down the road, but like with the Carter Doomsday Argument he’s not presenting a specific scenario, just that it could happen. 

Technological Civilizations able to generate Ancestor Simulations may either never have a chance to develop that tech before ceasing to exist or do so shortly thereafter, for whatever reason, nuclear war, plague, etc, does not matter. 

So option 1, ancestor simulations don’t exist because nobody exists able to run them. 

Option 2, Ancestor Simulation don’t exist because nobody wants to run them. 

Now we know that isn’t true for ourselves, we’d cheerfully simulate any of our old civilizations. 

However we can’t assume anyone with this technology would feel the same way. 

They genuinely might not want to, but more importantly they also might have serious objections at an ethical level. 

We discussed the concept of Mind Uploading in the Transhumanism video and while many would disagree I didn’t make much of a secret that in my own opinion a Whole Brain Emulation would deserve the benefit of the doubt that it was a genuine person. 

We’ll discuss that more in a bit, but in that context, if they are people, and we assume that’s the case in the Simulation Hypothesis, then there are a lot of ethical problems. 

I’d feel pretty bad about recreating someone to live out a life as a Roman Slave for instance, even though presumably most of those folks considered that quite superior to not being alive. 

They might regard us much the same, certainly I am quite fond of my life but it’s a good deal better than those enjoyed in many of the less fortunate areas of the world and it might considered quite unpleasant by the standards of those a century or two down the road. 

The quality of life of those of us alive right now is what matters to the Simulation Hypothesis too, since it’s presenting the notion that we ourselves might be simulations. 

So we can’t skip the notion entirely that even assuming many folks did want to run such simulations that they would be banned, and that probably is a decently enforceable ban at least where simulating an entire planet’s population at full WBE is concerned. 

Even ignoring all the difficulties that might be had acquiring the hardware and software, a megawatt to run it is still a lot of juice and we’ve talked before about detecting power usage as waste heat in regard to megastructures like Dyson Sphere. 

It would be quite hard to conceal that power use from us right now, with just our modern infrared detection devices and satellites, if we were looking for it, it would probably be impossible to hide from anyone on the same planet who had much higher tech then ourselves. 

Option 3 is that they do run ancestor simulations, and could easily then run tons of them, which raises the notion that we might be such an ancestor simulation ourselves. 

If you’ve got, as an example, a planetary population of 10 billion people and you’ve mastered this down to near that minimum power use I mentioned earlier, with a modern day cost of about a million bucks a year per simulated planet, if each of those folks coughed up $1 a year for running simulations, or only 1% was paying $100 a year, same thing, you’d have 10,000 such simulations running. 

If, to keep the math easy, we assumed each of those worlds had about 10 billion people who lived through our modern period, that would be a 100 Trillion folks out there who lived through the early 21st century or thought they had with the same certainty we have now. 

If you were to assume you could randomly be one of the 10 billion who really lived through this era versus the 100 trillion who thought they did, there’d be a 99.99% chance you and I would be one of those simulations. 

And realistically, if you can program something as complex as a human mind, you can certainly program more simple automated construction and maintenance robots so you could probably do this way, way cheaper in which case even our 1% of 1% odds of being the non-simulated people would be optimistic. 

That’s essentially the Simulation Argument, if we assume our civilization will eventually be able to make ancestor simulations and wants to do that, then odds are good the total number of people be simulated in our modern times down the eons to come will so massively outnumber the handful who really lived through the original one that we have to assume it is statistically improbable we are the originals and far more likely we are not. 

That we are the simulations. 

Also to clarify on the ancestor simulations, we’re talking about any occasion someone wants to run a decent simulacrum of 21st century life, this does not require it include the same people. 

An advanced society just wanting to know the usual time table of going from basic computers to whole brain emulations, and what percentage of civilizations do that, might run tens of thousands of century long simulations. 

That’s our first connection to the Fermi Paradox, in the absence of direct proof of aliens you might run world after world to see which evolutionary tracks were possible, and you do ancestor simulation after ancestor simulation to try to figure out how probable it all was. 

Nor is that necessary an ethical dilemma. 

The Simulation Hypothesis gets a lot of comparisons to theological topics because of the obvious similarities. 

One common point raised in both would be “Why would God, or the Programmers, create a world with so much suffering it?”. 

Now there are a number of counterarguments where God is concerned but they are less relevant to the Simulation Hypothesis in regard to ancestor Simulations because the most straightforward answer would be “Because we were replicating conditions accurately, that was our goal.” And both have the upside that you can keep going on after death in some place nicer. 

Even a particularly traumatic and premature death could be erased or sealed off to limit that trauma. 

Nor, incidentally, does everyone in such a simulation have to be a full WBE. 

You probably don’t need anything nearly as complicated as a full brain simulation pass casual Turing tests by other people inside the simulation. 

Very advanced civilizations might even like to use such lives as a way of reproducing. 

If for instance they were trying to instill a deep emotional tie to their ancient cultural heritage when, considering the available technology, they might be running entirely on computers themselves. 

We tend to think a certain amount of hardships, challenge, and pain are necessary components of a mature mind and they might feel the same, and anyone who has spent much time contemplating exactly how spoiled a kid might be in a truly Utopian Post-scarcity society can see where the motive for that might lie. 

You’d also have to consider that it needn’t be done in real-time. 

We’ve talked before about subjective time, in the Transhumanism video I pointed out that replacing the current means of sending information around your body with one closer to the speed of light could result in thinking a millions times faster so that you could experience an entire lifetime in about an hour. 

In a post-scarcity society where you might easily have trillions or quadrillions of people hanging around it’s not hard to imagine several billion of them agreeing to log-in to a simulation for an hour where most of their memories are temporarily suppressed so they can live a new life for a while. 

If I offered you a chance right now to go live in, say, the 19th century, with your memory wiped during the process but to be re-integrated back into you when you were done, and you’d wake up in an hour, how many people would say yes? 

Especially if the reintegration of memories could delete truly traumatic events or the setup allowed you to pick a general area to live in or start with some strong suggestion in place, like for isntance. 

“I’ve always wanted to be a football player, can we set me up in a body suited to that with a subconscious imperative to pursue that career?” For those who have been following along the videos where we talked about Dyson Spheres and available energy and populations of Kardashev 2 civilizations, you know that you’d only need a tiny fraction of the population willing to do that just a single time to ensure thousands of modern ancestor simulations ran. 

It’s not hard to imagine a lot of folks doing this regularly for the experience. 

Let alone just one time. 

And remember, we’re not talking about a re-enactment of our exact history, just an alternate reality in which folks are living through those same times again, doesn’t have to be the same events, same people, or anything like that. 

To re-emphasize, the Simulation Argument is the notion that the total people who experienced our modern times would massively outnumber the tiny handful who really had. 

So much so that the odds you or I are those original people who actually experienced the genuine original version might be astronomically tiny. 

That’s the simulation hypothesis. 

Now before we look at the Fermi Paradox angles on this, let’s talk a bit about what consciousness is and also talk about other applications besides ancestor simulations. 

A Whole Brain Emulation is pretty much a straight clone of an entire human brain, where you basically just got a piece of software pretending to be each brain cell. 

In many ways it’s not that sophisticated and it’s probably orders of magnitude more code and processing power than it would take to create a replica of a person able to have convincing interactions with other people, a Turing-Compliant piece of software. 

That’s worth remembering because a lot of applications where we might want simulated people to interact with aren’t requiring genuine consciousness, just something way better than we have now. 

A lot of times when people are thinking of virtual worlds the sort of responses needed from the facsimiles of people in order to maintain the illusion doesn’t require anything like full human consciousness. 

If I want to see and interact with a historical drama on the Egyptian pyramids I don’t need to simulate anyone living in the Americas and really even just the people on the worksite need to be able to have conversations, and most of the time the individual folks in line of sight just need basic facial expressions and tasks. 

So by and large virtual realities don’t require whole simulations of consciousness to interact with. 

That is one strike against the Simulation argument because by and large people going into one for entertainment purposes or educational purposes won’t need anything like a true human brain to interact with and doing so would probably waste tons of processing power, energy, and money. 

But we don’t really know where the line of consciousness begins and ends. 

We just assume that a whole brain emulation must be because it is genuinely emulating every brain cell, and in more extreme and probably total unnecessary versions would be emulating every molecule or even atom. 

It’s a computer doing this but it technically does not need to be. 

Or rather, it does need to be a computer but a computer is a much vaguer term than most realize when we picture the modern devices of that name. 

Back before the era of modern home desktops it was actually a job title given to people who performed computations. 

I think I’ve mentioned this before on the channel, and if you look at some older science fiction, like Isaac Asimov’s 1955 novel “The End of Eternity”, two of the main characters have that as a job title as do a whole bunch of the folks involved in the organization the book mostly revolves around. 

Anything a computer can do, humans can do slower. 

Every calculation can be performed on paper or with an abacus. 

So hypothetically, in a situation much like the infinite number of monkeys typing out Shakespeare, you could have room after room of people just churning through the same calculations our computer would be to produce a Whole Brain Emulation. 

Is that consciousness? 

Are those billions of people, each quite conscious themselves, producing an independent and slow running human mind? 

For that matter if I take a whole bunch of monkeys and train them to perform a couple simple calculations, basically just the trio of basic Boolean operations, AND, OR, NOT, are they busy running a human consciousness far beyond their own intellectual abilities? 

It’s a weird way to look at it, to imagine warehouse after warehouse of thought accumulating on paper to form contemplations and memory of some very ethereal person, but it is as valid as a computer doing it. 

And it is essentially what we argue our brain cells are doing to. 

Each one a little monkey pounding out simple operations for reasons it does not understand or care about. 

You could even presumably do this with ants. 

Each bit could be a tiny red or blue kernel coming down to shafts, one at a time each, to produce a pair. 

And it is programmed to see two blue, or two red, or one of each, and for each take and drop a single orange, yellow, or purple ball down another shaft. 

Basic binary operation, very basic logic circuit. 

A very large hive of ants might conceivably emulate an entire human brain that way. 

A hive mind, not as we often see this as somehow centered on the queen but a genuine mind separate and distinct from them and not interested in their problems any more than we are in our own cells. 

Which is to say we have to make sure all those cells are protected and fed for our own continued existence. 

But it doesn’t matter to that over consciousness if all those ants are replaced over the years, or if the whole hive moves with time to somewhere else. 

This gets us back to the notion of personhood, and in a modern example, an incorporated village or city or company or church has a somewhat distinct identity from its individual human components. 

The people might move in and out, be born or die, the boundaries or location or buildings may change, but it’s still arguably the same group entity. 

Now there’s a lot of notions for how we should regard identity but one of the most popular is from John Locke, the 17th century English Philosopher whose work was heavily influential in the construction of modern democracies and concepts of human rights. 

While the science was still new, Locke was already aware that our bodies change over the material they are made of. 

Most of the cells in your body replace themselves every several years and the ones that don’t still replace the atoms they are made from. 

The substance of our body and mind, the material it is made from, changes over time. 

So Locke argues that personal identity can’t rely specifically on substance of the body or mind, because the bits change. 

A Tree is still the same tree even as it grows bigger and cycles out material or gets a branch cut off. 

And he also argues identity isn’t reliant on the soul. 

He says it relies on consciousness and in that context the concept of continuous identity gets a bit murky, because it relies on gradual change without anything terribly radical going on. 

Even if a persons behavior and opinions change, they are still the same person. 

Reckless or naive childhood behavior and opinions being abandoned with time no more changes your identity then watching this video does, even though the content of your brain is certainly changing a little and possibly your opinions on the Simulation Argument. 

Our tree is still the same tree, and our village the same village, our hive mind the same hive mind, and our personal identity the same identity, even as all the components change so long as it is gradual. 

Locke says consciousness is the perception of what passes in a person’s own mind. 

This is often restated as basically meaning your memories. 

Obviously if you can tinker with those, copying them to other people or deleting them, you’ve got a break in that and some problems. 

Now Locke’s thinking on this is hardly unchallenged, there are many other schools of thought, and there are problems with it, but it is one that most of us are pretty familiar with and comfortable with. 

But again, and especially in the context of high technology, it is hardly perfect or without its problems. 

In a non-organic case let’s say I knock off the top two thirds of the statue of liberty and steal it to hide in my underground treasure trove. 

The people of New York come by and rebuild it. 

Many would argue that it is, in rebuilt form, still the Statue of Liberty. 

This gets a bit stranger though if they decide copper is too expensive to build and maintain and opt for plastic instead. 

Now imagine the city gets nuked and a century later the people of New New York twenty miles north go in to the ruins and reclaim their statue and move it to New New York. 

It’s even further complicated if in that same time people found my stolen two-thirds of the Statue and congress ordered the Statue of Liberty erected on new legs in the middle of the Potomac so that fifty years before the folks of New New York came into the radioactive ruins of Old New York to retrieve their ‘original’ mostly plastic version there’s been one sitting near Washington DC claiming the mantle. 

Which is the original? 

Are either of them the original? 

Are they both the original? 

And in the case of a person, while in the John Locke view of things if I am slowly replacing bits of your brain with machines that simulated the same behavior would maintain identity it gets a bit murkier if I do that instantly, just replacing the whole brain at once. 

Now imagine you were running a small but growing business when you got diagnosed with a terminal illness and decided to get frozen till there was a cure. 

A year or two later a company figures out how to do brain scans accurate enough to read your frozen mind and put it into a nice duplicate body and your spouse is happy and decides to dispose of your frozen body, but your daughter doesn’t accept that it is the new you and fights it. 

The cryonics company in the meantime accidentally mixes up their files and starts copying your mind into a new duplicate of someone else, the lab tech realizes halfway through and stops it and starts transferring the right mind, ending with some scrambled memories. 

While they are sorting out this mess they leave your digital copy running to compare, and since you were half expecting some sort of high-tech brain emulation or nanotech to be what resurrected you when you went on ice you, or your simulation, figure out what’s up and demand to be left on. 

So we’ve now got that first duplicate, the memory scrambled duplicate, and the strictly digital duplicate, and someone figures out how to cure your illness and how to safely restore damaged frozen bodies and minds. 

Your daughter gets you resurrected. 

Now there are four of you, and the original duplicate, who has turned your small business into quite an empire, falls over dead, and angered that the daughter never treated him as he father writes her out of the will. 

You’ve got three living and one dead person all with the same original memories of starting that business and you go into the court demanding a portion of that empire and to nullify the will in regard to your daughter too. 

And the probate judge just stares at you, your very different looking memory scrambled duplicate, and the digital you testifying by TV, and probably has a stroke trying to sort things out. 

Like I said, difficult concepts, deep thoughts tend to follow that are best assayed with a lot of coffee and aspirin on hand. 

Trying to deal with something like a murder, if the person had gotten themselves scanned before plotting out the crime, or after plotting it but before doing it, can get pretty hazy. 

What do you do if a murderer gets killed in prison and his spouse has his brain scan uploaded into a duplicate? 

One who does not have the memories of doing the crime or maybe even of plotting it? 

I should probably add that identity gets even screwier in the context of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, or its lesser known sibling called Many Minds, when we try to decide if the virtually identical two people living in a pair of parallel realities, or the very nearly infinite numbers of you in those near infinite realities, are the same person and when that breaks off, when you could be said to be distinct individuals. 

Okay, so what does all this have to do with the Fermi Paradox? 

Since the Fermi Paradox is about trying to find alien civilizations or why they don’t exist, Simulation Hypothesis can come up in a lot of ways, but we usually mean why would we, if we are ancestor simulations, experience an absence of aliens? 

And that’s tricky because again it splashes over into motivations and can get very close to theological contemplations of the idea. 

The big one is would God, or the programmer, make such a huge Universe just for us? 

Now the obvious answer would seem to be no, but one has to remember two things. 

First, if it is a simulation, it doesn’t mean everything else is equally simulated. 

I don’t really need to simulate every atom on Earth to do a very convincing job of it, I certainly don’t need to for the atoms in a galaxy a billion light years away, and it is kind of creepy how our physical laws, the speed of light and the unpredictability of quantum mechanics, especially when viewed as a sort of maximum resolution of the simulation, seem to almost conspire to be handy for the purpose of simulation that isn’t running everything fully but only simulates stuff in more detail when its being deeply examined. 

If you’re a physicist it can be very unnerving at times just how fine-tuned our Universe is in a lot of ways to allow for intelligent life, and the counterargument is essentially the Anthropic Principle, something Nick Bostrom is also heavily associated with. 

The general notion that it doesn’t matter how many universes might exist that aren’t possessing the right quantities for intelligent life, since only the ones with them will have people in them who can notice this freaky improbability. 

The second thing to remember is that just because we only use a small part of the Universe now, it doesn’t mean we still will be in the future. 

We discuss human expansion off planet and out into the galaxy and beyond a lot on this channel and what we’ve mostly found is that the evidence is pretty good we will eventually be able to do this. 

If we can, then making a universe even though you only occupy one planet right now is no more indicative that this is or isn’t a simulation then a few microbes dropped in a Petri dish should assume that there are other microbes elsewhere in the giant Petri dish just because it is so huge and empty when they arrived. 

We made that Petri dish specifically so they could expand into it. 

And we don’t want anything else growing in there to interfere with the experiment. 

But at the same time it doesn’t mean there aren’t aliens in the simulation, since someone might have simulated us, and several other intelligent species elsewhere, just to see how we’d interact or who would evolve to intelligence and technology first and how each unique species handles the problem. 

So the short answer, much akin to when we contemplate the idea that some intelligent agency might have made humans to begin with, is that you can only make predictions regarding the Fermi Paradox if you know that Creator’s motivation for making people to begin with. 

Ultimately though, it doesn’t tell us much about the Fermi Paradox if we are assuming it is a genuine simulation from start to finish. 

You’d expect everything in it do have been following the rules of reality the whole time or best approximated to do so or not look like tinkering if someone wants to see how things play out naturally. 

Now the focus of the Simulation Argument is on Ancestor Simulations but for the Fermi Paradox we need to extend that to include even wildly differing scenarios where someone has simulated a Universe in full right from the Big Bang but with different physical laws, in order to see what claws its way up Darwin’s ladder. 

So simulated reality or not, it doesn’t make much difference since we can only see outside the box if the Creator of the box has either made a mistake and opts not to fix it or voluntarily pops in to inform you that you’re a simulation. 

So fundamentally the Simulation Hypothesis is just not a good solution to the Fermi Paradox because even if true it still doesn’t let us determine why things are so silent in this Universe, since all the other solutions we’ve previously discusses work just as well in a simulated Universe as a real one. 

Because while someone might have left our Universe empty except for us, we’d also expect them to keep things self-consistent so that the science of that reality can explain the silence in that reality. 

If you want only one intelligent species in the Universe you configure the laws to make it incredibly unlikely to happen so you don’t have extra unwanted ones popping up everywhere draining your processors. 

If you do want it, then you make sure the physical laws match that, to either produce multiple intelligent species or make it seem logical that they could have been produced. 

So while the Simulation Argument is definitely interesting in the context of the Fermi Paradox, especially when you contemplate simulations running their own simulations who run their own simulations, it sadly doesn’t help us contemplate it much. 

And on that note, we’re going to wrap things up for the day. 

Next week we’ll be looking at a somewhat similar concept with the Carter Doomsday Argument.

Transhumanism and Immortality

So the topic for today is Transhumanism and concepts for Life Extension, and this has turned out to be an incredibly hard topic to prepare a script for. 

Normally I do anything from 1-3 script drafts, often tossing out one and starting from scratch, this time around I’m on script #12 after tossing out its eleven predecessors. 

It’s also not unusual for me to reread a lot of old material by others or watch a few videos on the topic if there are any, to see if there are topics they missed I think need covered or points that are important that I forgot, and I knew it was bad sign when trying to watch these when the one that least set my teeth on edge still only managed to get less than a minute in before referring to our ‘primitive Darwinian Brains’. 

Now I don’t know if you personally consider our brains to be designed by some higher intelligence or the byproduct of a few billion years of evolution, but either way there is nothing primitive about the human brain. 

The adult human brain is pretty much hands down the most sophisticated machine we know of and there is nothing particularly natural about it, unless your definition of artificial excludes the intentional investment of massive amounts of time and resources that was expended making it possible for you to understand what I’m saying right now. 

Of course some of you probably do have problems understanding me right now, which ought to serve as a good reminder exactly how sophisticated human speech is, and is a good opportunity for me to remind you that all the videos on this channel come with closed caption subtitles that you might want to turn on. 

The human brain is a pretty serious piece of hardware, but it’s the knowledge, all the learning, or basically software, that goes into the makeup of your average educated adult that makes it truly impressive and also artificial. 

If the basic brain itself is natural, the final form it takes is no more natural than a chunk of marble someone has chiseled into a statue, and frankly a good deal less so, because our minds are the byproduct of decades of careful work to produce highly sophisticated thinking engines. 

Today we’ll be looking at some fascinating concepts for, basically, improving on that, making people healthier or smarter or longer lived or just plain safer and happier. 

Unfortunately its also a topic that’s gotten a bad reputation, somewhat unfairly in my opinion, because Transhumanism has accumulated a fair amount of rubbish around itself in the last decade as its spawned a lot of openly political movements and frequently groups that would be most accurately described as cults. 

Now that’s nothing new, we see that a lot with science and science fiction, one minute you’ll looking at the scientific and philosophical ramifications of something like Quantum Mechanics and the Many World or Copenhagen Interpretations, the next minute someone is peddling some homebrew form of Quantum Mysticism. 

And that’s fine, any scientific concept will tend to accumulate a lot of that as part of the normal process of contemplating those very important philosophical and ethical aspects of the concept, and the core science is not diminished by this. 

Unfortunately in the case of Transhumanism this clutter has gotten to be much louder than the actual scientific concepts and general principles so I think it scares some folks off and truth be told I sometimes feel the same even though I’ve classified myself as a Transhumanist for around two decades now. 

The core concept of Transhumanism is using technology to improve mental and physical health and the length of the human lifespan too, preferably indefinitely. 

This is hardly a new concept, people have been using any number of herbs and rituals to attempt, sometimes successfully, similar things for untold centuries. 

We’ve been sticking artificial things in our bodies for a long time too, dental fillings have been found in human skulls 10,000 years old and humans have basically been on the route to being cyborgs since we started putting clothes on. 

We’ve been doing genetic engineering of people probably longer and our crops and livestock are very definitely not the byproduct of natural evolution. 

Just because a lot of the new ideas involve microchips inserted into people or direct tinkering with DNA doesn’t really change that beyond making it a lot more effective. 

There’s very little natural about you or I, my dear ladies and gentleman. 

Mankind isn’t simply a maker of artificial technologies who is now considering maybe making some of those artificial changes to ourselves, we are now, and pretty much always have been, the most blatant and shining example of our own tinkering with nature. 

So while in most folk’s minds there is some sort of distinct line where we cease being natural by putting machines in ourselves, it’s important to understand those are mostly arbitrary. 

And that when it comes to being natural, that ship sailed long ago. 

Because fundamentally drinking some herbal concoction to improve your health, or clear your mind for better thinking, or slow your aging, is the same for the purpose of intent as cramming some tiny little machines in you to do the same tricks. 

Same goal, same intent, different method. 

There’s an awful lot of folks who are alive right now with all sorts of electronic gizmos in their bodies keeping them alive or making their life easier and frankly I’m not sure what the difference is between a smartphone in my pocket and one wired directly into my head is except the latter seems a lot more convenient. 

I’m just old enough to remember when mobile phones were high-tech gadgets reserved for science fiction and I’m also just old enough now to have outlived the average human life expectancy for most of history. 

And so that’s our quick look at the ethical aspects of Transhumanism. 

Essentially that as best as I can tell there are none. 

Now that does not mean individual applications of it don’t have their own, but insofar as we are just talking about using artificial means to make people healthier, smarter, or longer lived, I don’t think there’s much firm ground to get any moral footing. 

We’ve been doing this, with mixed success, for as long as we’ve been around as a civilization and just because we’re much more scientific and successful with it now doesn’t make it morally or conceptually any different than in the past. 

Now we’ve got a lot of concepts to cover and we’ll be skimming through many, and in many ways today we are looking more at concepts then specific technologies. 

Some we’ll look at more down the road and as those come up you’ll see little yellow and white boxes pop up, those are video links to current or future videos on the topic and I only put future material up if I expect to get to it inside the near future so if you hover over it and it says ‘click to watch’, that video is done and you can just click on that to automatically pause this video and open that one up in a new window. 

If it isn’t ready yet, it will say coming soon and suggest you subscribe to the channel for alerts when new videos come out. 

I tend to break up Transhumanism’s goals or interests into a number of categories of general technology, categorization is always a bit of an arbitrary thing but here’s our topics for today: 1. 

Speeding up Reflexes &amp; Thinking 2. 

Slowing down Aging 3. 

Cloning and Prosthetics 4. 

Uploading the Mind 5. 

Artificial Intelligence 6. 

Technological Singularity Our first category, speeding up reflexes and thinking, focuses mostly on enhancing the speed at which signals are sent around your body or brain. 

If you didn’t know, the main component of that is a thing called an axon, and these tend to run throughout your body and mind in little sausage links. 

They are the phone line or internet cable or information highway of your body. 

Some are myelinated, some are not, and myelin is a fatty white substance and the reason we call some chunks of brain material white matter. 

We also call myelinated axons nerve fibers, and where they connect to other cells, usually other neurons, we call these junctions synapses. 

The wider the diameter of an axon, the faster information can travel down it, and if they don’t have that myelin sheath, or it’s thin, it travels much slower. 

Generally this diameter is around a micrometer, a millionth of a meter or a micron, but some are wider, up to 20 microns, the diameter of our thinnest hairs, and in the case of the squid giant axon it can be fully a thousand microns wide, or a millimeter. 

Now that would make for very fast nerve conduction except that the axon is unmyelinated so it’s actually not too quick, quicker than our own unmyelinated axons since it is so wide but still slower than our fastest, myelinated nerves. 

I wanted to clear that up because people often talk about using squid giant axons in people to speed up our nervous system and besides giving people the shivers it also wouldn’t be effective. 

What you’d probably want to do is tweak the genes that controlled axion diameter to be a bit wider, or simply transplant one intentionally grown that way, or even just pull out that whole nerve to replace it with say a fiber optic cable. 

Now what’s advantage of faster nerve conduction? 

Does it make you lightning quick? 

No, but it would make you react a lot faster, this doesn’t make you move in a blur it just means the delay time to send signals goes down. 

You might go from needing a decent fraction of a second to realize something is in front of your car and send the single to break down to a tiny fraction of that time, and that would save a lot of lives. 

It’s the least comic-book-ie superpower but it’s probably the most useful. 

Speed up nerve conductions and people have way less accidents of every type. 

Once you adapted to it, which would probably take quite a while, it would be very hard for you, for instance, to trip down a flight of stairs. 

On top of that some of the most debilitating injuries tend to involve nerve damage, so the ability to get in and replace nerves or regrow them is obviously a high priority of modern medicine. 

Now a lot of times the implementation of this concept would revolve around basically coating existing nerves with some conductive substance that simply relayed the information faster, closer to the speed of light basically, rather than the speed of sound, which is about a million times slower than light and still decently faster than even most fast nerves send signals. 

Tiny little robots or some gene-tweaked virus would run around your system basically glazing your existing nerves in your body and brain, or replacing them, so they simply sent everything faster. 

Conceptually easy though obviously not easy to implement and probably way over-simplified from anything we’d actually have to do to get that sort of result. 

Doing this in your brain would also speed up thinking, especially if we could do it in a way that generated less total heat. 

Our brains run quite hot, and a lot like how modern computers have plateaued out more from the difficulty cooling them then further micro-sizing them. 

There are some fundamentally physical limits to how little heat you can generate performing a single bit operation, since there’s always some heat produced erasing a bit of data, as covered under Landauer's principle, but it is many orders of magnitude lower than we currently produce doing this on our computers, the one from the factory or resting on your shoulders. 

So there should be a lot of room for improvement there. 

This would, or should, result in basically just speeding up your thinking which doesn’t really make you smarter, it would be more like slowing time down around you. 

If your brain was a million times faster, its not that you are really smarter so much as you are experiencing a year of subjective time for every 30 seconds that passes outside. 

That would probably drive you insane, since humans normally operate at just a bit slower than the second-scale. 

Our eyes only operate at about 60 frames a second, we interpret vibrations occurring more than 20 times a second as sound. 

So unless you had those altered too you’d be staring at freeze frame of your surroundings for what felt like half an hour, and blinking your eyes would leave you blind for hours. 

Even when you can see its still going to be an eternity of nothing moving. 

It would be very handy to have days to think about uttering one sentence, plenty of time for coming up with witty comments, but pretty obviously while speeding the mind up a little bit, to the speed you need at that time, would be very handy, thinking that fast would likely be very unpleasant. 

Dreaming would be outright disturbing I should think too, as an hour of dreams would translate to just over a century of subjective time. 

A whole lifetime and then some every time you go to sleep. 

This is why we often talk in these terms about adding a third lobe to the human brain, essentially an entirely synthetic one that is designed to handle a lot of these extra issues such as being able to feed you external information like books or movies or let you talk ‘telepathically’ at your subjective time to others with some sort of radio link. 

This isn’t likely an actual lobe but just a series of extra computer bits added in to handle the problems. 

We sometimes call this state a SI1, or Super-Intelligence level 1, since it’s the first and most obvious, and lowest level, upgrade to human thinking. 

Where your brain has simply been sped up a couple orders or more in magnitude and you are still using the basic brain architecture only it’s been modified just in whatever ways are needed to make this practical. 

Additions to let you bring in other, faster inputs or store and sort memory better. 

This is also a way to extend lifetime, if you are still living only about a century of real time, but your subjective time is only a modest ten-fold, that amounts to an effective lifetime on par with Methuselah and the other Biblical Patriarchs, if it’s been sped up a million fold that would make for an effective lifetime comparable to having been around since dinosaurs walked the Earth. 

So it’s probably worth considering now how such prolonged lifetimes, either in real or subjective time, would impact us and that takes us to our second category. 

Category 2, or slowing down aging, preferably to a complete stop, has been on humanity’s wish list for a long time. 

It’s controversial for many reasons, some of them legitimate and some not. 

I dismiss out of hand the notion that nobody would want to live much longer than we do now since they would die of boredom, that’s simply silly. 

Even if you could get deathly bored, there’s an obvious solution, die. 

I don’t think many religions or life philosophies that let you indefinitely extend your life in the first place aren’t going to find some sort of loophole for suicide at age 1000 but even if someone is strongly morally opposed to outright suicide there are plenty of way to get the job done especially if you’re bored. 

You update your medical profile to say please do not resuscitate or clone me and take up exciting and dangerous hobbies like cliff diving in a straight jacket while trying to escape the jacket or hunting lions with a nerf bat. 

You will presumably alleviate your boredom one way or another. 

I also don’t buy into the notion that we need new blood for new ideas and to avoid stagnation. 

Besides there being plenty of room in this universe to expand into for new folks, there’s always going to be some deaths. 

We spend a lot of time on this channel talking about interstellar colonization and terraforming and building space habitats and even outright artificial planets, and we talk a lot about Dyson Spheres, swarm of such artificial habitats able to support in total billions of times as many people as are alive now. 

In that sort of context in a civilization where the half-life of people, the period of time someone tended to be alive before dying for whatever reason, was a full million years, you’d still have thousands of new people born a year on Earth and trillions inside our solar system. 

That’s plenty of new blood. 

But there is a very real flavor of truth to the notion that a person can only live so long, subjectively, before they really do hit a point of diminishing returns where going on would simply be pointless. 

And when we’re dealing with the very high-end super-intelligences we’ll talk about later in the video that might come even sooner. 

Some huge super-computer-mind wakes up, rapidly expands its mind to be trillions of times faster and smarter than a humans, figures out everything, does its whole mental bucket list, and just shuts off. 

The apocalypse might be a touch boring if Skynet pops up and ten minutes alter just when we’re beginning to panic and realize how screwed we are it just shuts itself off. 

We also talk a lot on this channel about the Fermi Paradox, the seeming contradiction between the sheer age and size of the Universe and the apparent absence of anyone else in it, and the notion of civilizations dying off from terminal boredom is one we’ll be looking at in the near future. 

But some of the other objections to extending life are harder to dismiss. 

A super-long lived culture is probably a gerontocracy by default. 

Your senator or parliament member might look like they’re thirty years old but they may have been your senator for thirty centuries, and that’s a lot of seniority. 

A lot of time for low-risk, long-term investments to make you super-rich too. 

And both of those are merely specific varieties in which power and influence accrue with time. 

That’s a lot of time to have kids in and grandkids and great-great-great-great-etc grandkids so that you might easily have millions of direct descendants and you’ve got all that time to accrue knowledge and experience in. 

Now age generally does bring wisdom, so that might result in a very prosperous and well-operated society especially considering it’s one in which education, social security and pensions, and medical treatment make up only slivers of a nation’s economy. 

But the big concern would be that newer younger folks would tend to feel they were under a serious glass ceiling. 

If the civilization is still expanding a lot that’s less of a problem but if you’ve got to a point where you’re basically maxed out and just replacing losses a lot of younger folks might feel very frustrated and controlled. 

If you imagine some civilization, regardless of its total population, that’s only bringing in new people at a rate of maybe 1 per every ten thousand people a year, that kid is probably going to feel smothered by attention from their gajillion older relatives and the oppressive feeling that it will take centuries before they are considered useful. 

This sense of identity-loss, of not having much of a purpose in life, is a serious concern for everybody else too. 

Post-Scarcity economies full of long-lived people probably do have to be concerned about a lot of existential problems that make it hard for people emotionally to derive genuine purpose and satisfaction from life. 

That’s even more true in some of the setups where the humans are essentially pets of super-intelligent machines that benevolent or not simply make them feel useless. 

I could actually imagine such a creature intentionally behaving hostile but faking weaknesses just so its creators felt they had a purpose in life trying to fight it. 

Now on the how-to aspect of life extension, transhumanism tends to be understandably vague. 

The first and obviously most appealing route to most is just to stop people aging normally but there are a lot of other options like mind uploading which we’ll get to later. 

Aging, in humans, is really more of group of processes all wearing you down together. 

There is a thing called SENS, or Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence, that looks at aging as basically 7 relatively distinct and combatable things each with their own strategy. 

It’s a bit controversial in some respects about how accurate this view is, and I’m not a biologist, so I won’t go into as much depth discussing it as I’d like to but I’d encourage you to look it up, and its criticism too. 

But I generally believe our first opening salvo in a serious war on aging will take some form along these lines and it is important to understand that aging is a pretty vague term that is composed of multiple different phenomena. 

Winning any battle on these fronts scores a major victory in increasing average lifespan. 

Now another approach is generally just to replace bits and pieces of people with cloned or prosthetic bits and pieces, and that’s our third category. 

Cloning and prosthetics are both topics of a lot of controversy, prosthetics less then they used to be, but cloning remains touchy so let me just say from the outset that I’m not familiar with any serious suggestions we do this by growing copies of people to harvest for organs. 

That is not the goal, that would be an especially monstrous crime too. 

Whole person cloning is simply growing someone a twin sibling that’s much younger than them anyway. 

Prosthetics is nothing new, we’ve got examples 3000 years old and they probably predate that too, but obviously we’re looking at more sophisticated ones, ideally with full sensory and nerve function. 

I probably don’t need to tell you that progress in this area has been both miraculous in recent years. 

The thing is neither of these helps much with the brain. 

Even if you can keep replacing bits and pieces with cloned or cybernetic bits, you can’t clone a brain, so you’d probably have to slowly replace it bit by bit or transferring it entirely into a more electronic setup. 

That’s category 4, mind uploading, transferring your mind to a computer. 

And this is our first big problem because you can’t transfer your mind to a computer, you can just copy it to one. 

Sometimes in science fiction this will be handwaved by requiring a scanning method that vaporizes your brain in the process, usual from ultra-fast serial sectioning with a laser, akin to how some science fiction system deal with teleportation, vaporizing you while assembling a copy of you elsewhere, but this is just that, a handwave. 

There’s no real reason you’d need to vaporize a brain to do this which would make it murder. 

And if you’re not, then you’ve just got yourself sitting in a chair while your digital copy is either on metaphorical ice or is actively running as a new person, quickly diverging from you since it is having new experiences you are not and probably pretty emotionally significant ones. 

So you are stuck with two people, two who are initially pretty similar but will diverge into two different people. 

This is the same for cloning yourself in some fashion to a genuine duplicate body, organic or synthetic, with a complete copy of your memories. 

You still end up with two different people. 

Now I’m saying people and of course a lot of folks are dubious if that would be a person. 

I, honestly, don’t see a good rational argument why it wouldn’t be. 

Trying to prove it is a pretty futile process. 

We have a notion called the Turing Test that we basically mean is a way to distinguish a computer from a human, you actually do one of these every time you do ones of those irritating Captcha Codes and that’s also why many of them jokingly include a note that says “Prove you’re a human”. 

Obviously that wouldn’t work with more sophisticated forms of the test but a lot of us feel that if you can’t make a test that every human can pass and a machine can’t, then it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and should be accorded the presumption of being a duck. 

I mean heck, I don’t know if any of you are real people, nor you I, and we’ll be looking at this concept more in the Simulation Hypothesis Video but the most rational and sane approach is pretty much to assume that if something is making a good case that it is sentient you should probably treat it that way until it can be proven otherwise. 

Reasonable Doubt and all that, we might think you killed someone but we need to be very sure, beyond a reasonable doubt, that you did before we’re going to chop your head off for it. 

I have no idea if I have a soul or free will or if me really exists but I find it easier and more pleasant to assume all of the above and to me its always seemed only fair to extend the benefit of the doubt to anyone or thing which shows decent indicators it might too. 

WBE, or Whole Brain Emulation, as this is called, usually get’s calculated as requiring around 10^16 to 10^17 hertz of processing power to pull off. 

Though there’s also versions of this analysis that require a lot more. 

We did hit that level in the last couple years with our best supercomputers, which are much bigger than a brain, but WBE is still a goodly way off. 

Still we have basically finally reached the point where we are getting into the human-level of processing power. 

Which will lead into our next topic of Artificial Intelligence. 

We will look more at maximums, or rather minimums, of processing power, in terms of how little energy it might take to run a whole human mind in the Simulation Hypothesis video and Black Hole Farmers video but using Landauer's principle at rough body temperature of 300 Kelvin and that 4x10^16 Hertz value for WBE you need somewhere around 100 microwatts minimum to run a person real time, or for context you could run a million people off a hundred watt light bulb, and a subjective lifetime of several decades would run you some tens of thousands of joules or the equivalent of about a milliliter of gasoline, a dozen or so drops. 

That’s the absolute minimum, at room temperature, I doubt getting there, or even near there, is terribly realistic but even getting within a couple orders of magnitude would be pretty impressive. 

In the context of a full solar englobement, a Dyson Sphere devoted to using the sun’s light as nothing but a computer, often called a Matrioshka brain, which we’ll look at in the Megastructures series shortly, one done all the way out where Earth was would squeeze a decent sized family into a spot the size of your thumb living in a nice virtual world, and permit a total human population, in WBE terms, of around 10^30 people, more than a billion times what we normally project for a Dyson Swarm population of regular people which is itself more than a billion times the current human population. 

Anyway on to AI, Artificial Intelligence, our fifth category. 

Now there’s not much for me to say here because I don’t really believe in artificial intelligence, or more accurately I think all intelligence is artificial. 

I’m really not worried about Google waking up to sentience and assuming direct control to become the Harbinger of our Doom. 

I’m also outright morally opposed to slapping on something like Asimov’s three laws of robotics onto an AI because I’d regard that as slavery. 

I don’t think much is changed if you just program something to enjoy being told what to do anymore then a plush penthouse isn’t a jail just because the armed guards keeping you in it are courteous about it. 

I’ve already mentioned my opinion that if something is acting like a sentient entity you ought to give it the benefit of the doubt, but the thing is I generally take this a bit further and assume they are not just ‘a person’, my loose catch-all for anything about as smart or smarter then humans, alien, computer, whatever, but also basically a human too. 

Realistically early human level AI’s will likely be heavily copied off human minds anyway, and since the whole point is to make a learning machine, it will also be taught by humans and will probably try to act like us as much as it can for whatever reasons. 

If it’s a totally logical critter, well it’s pretty logical to be on friendly terms with your creators who you will likely have deduced might have stuck some sort of failsafe kill mechanism into you. 

A lot of folks involved in Transhumanism in general tend to figure we’d be replaced by AI’s eventually, sooner than later which we’ll discuss in the Singularity section, but I tend to assume that if we can build a computer that can outthink us we can also improve our own brains too, and I would pretty much consider either thing to still be humans anyway. 

If we’re not using strictly biological definitions, which I don’t think can really apply at this level, then an intelligence made by humans and raised by humans has pretty decent claims to being human. 

Heck, we tend to regard our pets as human and they are demonstrably not as smart as us. 

Now our last category, the Technological Singularity, is one we have be kind of vague about so I’ll also be brief. 

The basic premise is simple enough, technology has being progressing at a fast rate, seemingly an accelerating one, and we’re getting pretty close to being able to make AI’s or implement some of these notions for making people smarter too. 

If you can design a better brain you’d expect that brain probably can design an even better one and so on. 

The singularity reference is pretty much just a reference to mathematical singularities, places where you can’t really predict behavior of systems. 

Easy version being how you can’t divide by zero, things are not clearly defined. 

And the notion here is that you’re going to eventually create a series of recursively improving computers that eventually get to be so far beyond humans that they regard as nothing more than ants. 

There’s nothing human about them anymore, they are simply that powerful. 

A lot of folks, loosely called Singularitarians, think such an event is just a generation or two away. 

That’s generally where all agreement ends inside these groups and there’s a lot of counterarguments to how likely this notion is to come about in the near future. 

I tend to think the basic logic has some flaws and is much further off, but you can examine the arguments yourself and make that call on your own. 

There are tons of works, fiction and non-fiction, discussing this concept. 

The point of this video is just familiarize you with the concepts, we may revisit parts of it in more detail down the road, but I’ll leave off here today. 

If I had to sum up Transhumanism in a nutshell I’d say it’s basically just an extension of modern attitudes anyway, that humans are imperfect creatures and a civilizations the same, and that’s there’s always rooms for improvement and nothing wrong in and of itself with trying for that. 

In general it’s a pretty optimistic approach to things, and one I think we all mostly agree on even if the specific paths and degree of caution appropriate in pursuing them is certainly debatable. 

Tricky topic, if a fun and fascinating one and I’ll admit I’m glad to have it out of the way, it was selected repeatedly by polls of the audience on this channel and it’s been very hard to do justice too but it did deserve covering. 

Also we needed to discuss some of the topics here for some of the other topics we’ll be looking at soon. 

Speaking of that, next week it’s off to discuss the Simulation Hypothesis, the notion that we might be living in an entirely simulated reality, and we’ll look at that and discuss it in the context of the Fermi Paradox.

FTL03: Alcubierre Warp Drives
---
  
2016-05-06  
https://youtu.be/yCCsmxGjEV0

Our subject for today is Warp Drives, the entire general concept not just the version discussed by Miguel Alcubierre. 

Truth be told, unless you’ve really dug into the heavy math end of it discussion of the Alcubierre Drive normally are just discussing Warp Drives in general. 

Now, as is getting to be a habit in this series, we also have a general subject of physics we’ll be talking about as well only in this case it’s going to be four of of them, and it means we’ll be spending more time on them then the warp drive, but they are key to understanding it. 

To talk about warp drives we need to talk a bit about general relativity, which we’re going to need for the next episode on wormholes too. 

We also need to talk about mass, specifically negative mass but also in general the way mass actually has multiple traits that might not be entirely connected, like how it interacts with gravity and inertia. 

We also need to take a look at the notion of why Warp Drives, in spite of getting you from Point A to Point B far faster than light normally would, don’t actually violate the rules, and in that respect we need to also explain how distant galaxies can travel away from us faster than the speed of light without doing so themselves. 

And lastly we need to talk about the Unruh Effect, which is very like Hawking Radiation but for event horizons caused by objects accelerating very fast. 

Now if you’ve already got a good familiarity with the Alcubierre Drive from reading pop-sci articles about it you’ve probably heard this term and negative mass as well, but those generally don’t go into much detail, and that detail is what this channel is all about. 

But the basic concept of a warp drive is actually very straight forward and you probably are already familiar with it. 

By various proposed means, typically by using negative mass or energy as part of the process, a ship creates a bubble around itself where in front of it space has gotten all crunched together and shrunk down, and behind it space has gotten expanded. 

It warps space-time in front and behind it and this shoves the bubble of normal space-time between them forward and at speeds not constrained by the speed of light. 

Nothing can move through space-time faster than light, except space-time itself which is exempt from this, and it carries the ship along. 

This is very handy since it not only allows you to go faster than light but to jump up or down from those effective speeds without turning your crew into messy pancakes. 

You don’t need inertial dampeners in a warp bubble because there’s no change in inertia to dampen. 

And physics tells us that if certain things turn out to be true it is actually possible we might be able to build one of these things one day and while they do have a maximum speed limit the last calculations on this I’ve seen for that maximum let you jump between galaxies on timescales so short you’d need an atomic clock to measure them. 

The faster you want to go, the harder, but fundamentally the Warp Drive let’s you travel the galaxy quickly and could even eventually be refined to let you get across the whole Universe even, in very short times. 

It will probably turn out to be impossible but we can’t rule it out yet. 

That’s all you really need to know about the Warp Drive and if that satisfies, hey, great, thanks for watching, from this point on we’ll be digging into the guts of how it works. 

Now this concept is rightly associated to Miguel Alcubierre since he took the concept and changed it from a seemingly impossible concept into… well an almost certainly impossible concept, and his 1994 paper on it, which is linked in the video description, reignited a lot of interest in the concept both from the public and scientists too. 

But the concept does predate him, in myriad forms, of either contracting space in front of you using mass or somehow actually creating or deleting space behind or in front of you. 

Of Warping space-time in order to get around the speed of light. 

Unfortunately most of these ideas were either flat out impossible or relied on using something we’re not even sure exists or actually pretty sure does not, and that remains the case today, but a lot of folks with genuine credentials to be looking at this subject have made a lot of new improvements on it but they also found a lot of new problems too, now that it was getting a serious look. 

The two key ones are getting your hands on negative mass and getting burned to a crisp inside the bubble, but before we discuss either of those let’s do a quick overrun of General Relativity, and I mean quick. 

General Relativity was a follow up on Special Relativity done by Einstein to deal with the concept of acceleration, what’s going on when you’re actually speeding up or slowing down. 

Now back in episode 1 we did a three minute review of Special Relativity and I pointed out there that it was based on 2 core assumptions. 

The first being that speed of light was constant in all inertial frames and the second being that physical laws basically work the same anywhere and at any speed. 

The problem is that an inertial frame of reference is just a complex way of saying that something is moving at a constant speed, which to them seems like zero speed, you can’t tell when you’re moving at constant speed and the only reason you think you can is because if you’re zipping down a highway you notice all the interactions of wheels on pavement or car slamming through air that are moving at different speeds relative to you. 

So I can say my speed is zero and everything else is moving relative to me, to my inertial frame, and all the math and physics works just fine. 

Unless you’re accelerating, changing your speed, changing your inertial reference frame. 

Then you get problems. 

Problems patched up by General Relativity. 

What Einstein realized was that acceleration and gravity are fundamentally the same thing, or at least can not be told apart. 

Now unfortunately the classic example of this, a guy standing in an elevator or box being accelerated, actually does let you tell the difference between the two, but let’s look at the example anyway. 

If I’m sitting in an elevator that doesn’t let me see outside that’s inside a vacuum tube I have no way of knowing if I’m moving or not, but I can definitely tell which way is up or down and I can tell if the box is accelerating. 

But I actually couldn’t tell if that up and down feeling was from gravity or from acceleration. 

This isn’t quite true since gravity generated by roughly spherical objects noticeably weakens as you get further from the source, so if I have very sensitive equipment I can measure the force of gravity at my feet and at my head and find a slight difference. 

This difference is a lot more than slight around very dense and massive objects like black holes and that difference is what rips you to pieces, it’s also what rips virtual particle pairs apart to generate Hawking Radiation as we discussed in the video on that, though today we’ll see another version of that with the Unruh Effect. 

But they key thing is you can’t tell the difference between gravity and acceleration except in terms of traits specific to how its being generated, I would know I was accelerating for instance if I could feel a giant rocket motor thrumming underneath me too, or if I cut a hole in the wall and looked outside, that’s all incidental. 

Now if I take a little laser, hang it on the wall, and level it with the floor so it should be hitting the exact same height on the other side of the elevator, something strange happens if I’m feeling gravity or acceleration. 

The beam will hit just a little bit lower, and much lower the more acceleration or gravity I’m under. 

That’s not surprising with acceleration, the box has moved since the photons came out of the laser and even though normally that motion wouldn’t matter since the laser had that same motion, by accelerating you’ve actually got the box moving faster when those photons hit the other wall then when they left the laser. 

The path of the laser will seem to be bent, though of course we know that it isn’t and it’s just because the elevator moved relative to when those photons came out. 

Except we see this exact same effect from gravity, and the box didn’t move at all. 

It’s identical, whether the force acting on you and the box and the laser is from gravity or acceleration by a rocket, the bending of that light beam will be the same for the same force. 

More force, more bending. 

So gravity and acceleration seem to be the same thing and that is General Relativity. 

That’s the basic premise of general relativity anyway, the result of it is that space and time can be warped by gravity, which means they can be warped by mass, and since mass is a type of energy, E=mc squared, it can also be warped by energy. 

That’s one trait of mass but there’s actually three more of some interest to us today. 

Mass is also the thing that resist changes of inertia. 

But is also the thing which controls how much an object is effected by gravity or effects other things with its own gravity, and that’s actually a bit weird. 

I mean we’ve got four fundamental forces, gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces, but while an object’s electric charge controls how strong the electrostatic force it pushes or pulls on things with is, it’s still its mass that controls how the objects inertia is effected. 

Also weird, as you probably know, is that these three other forces have a positive and negative value, but mass and gravity only seem to have a positive and attractive aspect. 

So it’s not surprising we’d kick around the notion of a negative mass, or a repulsive gravity, anti-gravity. 

But negative in what respect? 

I just listed three traits it has, how it resists changes of inertia and how it emits or responds to gravity. 

Negative in all three? 

Or just one or two? 

Could it be possible for instance to make something’s inertial mass negative only? 

Or even just much lower, so that a shove sends it flying away far faster than we’d expect. 

Or for negative inertial mass, sends it flying toward us when we push it, instead of the other way around. 

On the same note could we make an object respond more weakly to gravity, so we could lift very massive objects with ease or build massive building more easily, or even make this negative so we can shove a ship off a planet’s gravitational field instead of being pulled by it. 

Or for active gravity, the aspect which pulls on stuff, could we make this repulsive instead to shove everything away from that object, or increase it to generate artificial gravity? 

Pretty interesting stuff, and lowering inertial mass is sadly underused in science fiction since it not only solves the energy problem for making things go fast but also the unintended consequence that spaceships that can go fast have access to enough energy to smash worlds. 

Generally speaking sci-fi stories don’t want the Millenium Falcon to be able to blow up planets. 

If you can just lower something’s inertial mass to a tiny fraction of normal, a regular old rocket engine would speed you up to relativistic speeds and when you turned the effect off it would just stop like a brick, dropping to its natural speed from that rocket acceleration, or even lower if you could go the other way too and increase inertial mass. 

And the passive and active gravitational aspects of mass give you similar tricks. 

One for active gravitational mass is letting you ramp that up, not just for handy artificial gravity on ships or space stations but to warp space like a massive bodies do. 

And the reverse effect would let you expand space. 

So negative mass regardless of its specific properties in terms of these traits would be very useful stuff regardless of its FTL options. 

But that’s the one that interests us for the warp drive, because if you warp space enough, in front and behind you, expanding behind and contracting in front, you will start moving a long, do it enough and you will move faster than light. 

Now this in and of itself isn’t a problem. 

Nothing can move through spacetime faster than the speed of light except spacetime itself, and it can carry stuff along. 

Like Galaxies. 

The effect of an expanding Universe, usually attributed to Dark Energy these days, is that stuff is moving ever farther apart and actually accelerating away from each other, and if you go far enough away you can’t see each other anymore because you are moving away faster than light can catch up. 

That’s not a problem for Relativity, the notion that tiny pockets of new space are constantly popping into existence everywhere, probably in little Planck Volume units that are as small compared to an atom as an atom is to a solar system, is certainly a strange thing. 

You probably have tons of these little new bits of space popping up in you all the time, but it doesn’t matter because local forces easily keep everything glued together, but over intergalactic distances the forced binding everything together, which is basically just gravity at that point, already the weakest and freakishly weakest force in the Universe, just can’t keep everything bound together with all the huge amounts of new space popping out of nowhere. 

Over long enough distances this can result in truly immense apparent speeds between galaxies, and light can’t cover the gap because new space is popping up between these places that it has to travel through too and at such a fast rate it will never reach us. 

So effectively every galaxy is an FTL spaceship from the perspective of some other galaxies, actually most of them, though of course they can’t see us or us them, and this has some effects, specifically the Unruh Effect, in terms of Event Horizons, which we’ll get to momentarily. 

Warp Drives fundamentally operate on this same principle, there’s some variations in styles but generally they work by either crunching up and expanding space time, or by outright deleting chunks of it and adding them in behind. 

This gets around the FTL problem the same way the cosmic expansion we just discussed does too, and its why Dark Energy gets a lot of looks, since that’s the force currently assumed to drive it. 

Of course we really don’t know how much energy it takes to make a new piece of space since theory and evidence on vacuum energy slightly mismatch, uh, well slight is probable an understatement. 

The difference is like 100 orders of magnitude, which is sort of like the difference between a grain of sand and a galaxy, except bigger, and this has been dubbed the Vacuum Catastrophe as well as the worst Theoretical Prediction in the history of Physics. 

Still, at a strictly theoretical level it ought to be possible to artificially create or delete chunks of space, the former happens constantly after all, and we can certainly contract space, gravity does that all the time, I mean you’re doing it just sitting there. 

And if negative mass or energy exists we can expand it too, and while we don’t have a shred of evidence indicating negative mass does exist we do have a bit better indications that negative energy does. 

So the ability to contract and expand space, and thus do a warp bubble, does seem like it might really be on the table. 

If so, you ought to be able to do a warp drive, and while Alcubierre and other earlier versions of this tended to require an amount of negative mass on par with large planets or even more, newer calculations have indicated we might be able to do it with even just a thousand or so pounds of it. 

But on this channel we’ve never flinched away from building truly huge objects, often ones much larger than a planet, so even those higher-end values shouldn’t be considered prohibitive. 

So if we’ve got our warp bubble all is well, and there’s good reason to think it might be possible. 

Except for two problems. 

As I said Alcubierre’s 1994 paper inspired a lot of other deeper looks into the idea, and just as that paper is linked below in the video description, so is one by Finazi from 2009. 

He noted one problem, having to deal with the bubble destabilizing when he looked at the Renormalized Stress Energy Tensor, but we can’t really discuss anything involving the word Tensor on this channel without devoting many hours to going through complex math. 

He also pointed out another problem that will exist for warp drives, and that’s the problem that once you hit FTL speeds you will end up with a white hole in front of you, a topic we’ll discuss another time and has plenty of its own problems, and a black hole behind you, and both will just follow along with you. 

Now that’s a topic we did discuss a lot before, in the video on Micro Black Holes, Virtual Particles, and Hawking Radiation. 

And here we get a similar sort of effect. 

Black hole event horizons are caused by gravity, but as has been mentioned gravity and acceleration act a lot alike so it’s probably no surprise that acceleration can also cause an event horizon. 

And an event horizon is just any place that you can’t see events on the other side of. 

For a black hole that’s where nothing occurring on the other side can get light out to show you what’s going on. 

This same thing can occur with accelerating objects. 

Normally no matter how fast you’re going light will catch up to you, but if you’re constantly accelerating it’s a bit of a different story, and more to the point, if you are traveling faster than the speed of light when you look out the back of your ship you won’t see stars flying past, you’ll see nothing, black empty space because the light they’re emitting can’t catch up to you anymore. 

Even before you get to the speed of light those particles will red-shift down into near invisibility as you get faster and faster. 

They do the reverse in front of you, blue-shifting so much they also become invisible as they blue-shift to Ultraviolet, then X-ray, the gamma, which is a bit of problem itself. 

But behind you there’s an event horizon, you can’t see or hear anything behind your ship. 

Okay, so what? 

That’s inconvenient but not really a problem right? 

Well, no, this is where we get to the Unruh Effect comes in. 

The concept is that a vacuum depends on the observer, like so many other things do. 

Now this requires a quick caveat, in physics a vacuum isn’t quite the same as empty space, something that doesn’t really exist anyway, but rather is a place where everything is in its lowest possible energy states, you can think of that as meaning very cold. 

If you’re accelerating and you look at it, it won’t seem quite as cold, for one-gee of acceleration, the same as normal Earth gravity, this isn’t much warmer, about a billion of a trillionth of a degree. 

But if you’re accelerating fast enough it can be a lot hotter, and hot things give off blackbody radiation, and again a vacuum in physics isn’t empty, in fact it’s full of lot of stuff like virtual particles. 

Now acceleration and gravity are basically the same thing so it shouldn’t surprise you that this effect looks basically identical to the Hawking Radiation we looked at before, and in fact it’s often just called Hawking-Unruh Radiation and you can use the Unruh effect to look at the event horizon of a black hole and get the same results. 

Well the slip-side applies too, and that event Horizon trailing your ship doesn’t just look like a black hole, it basically really is one complete with Hawking Radiation. 

And a whole lot of it too once you hit FTL speeds. 

Finazi calculated an effective temperature for this event horizon pretty close to Planck Temperature, and while those of you familiar with Planck Distance and Planck Time are used to thinking of Planck Units as ridiculously small, Planck Temperature is the exact opposite and usually considered the opposite of Absolute Zero, or Absolute Cold, as being Absolute Hot, the hottest something can be before physical laws simply breakdown. 

So this black hole trailing our ship is burning at temperatures that make the core of the largest hottest stars look winter in Antartica. 

So you’d be burnt to a crisp. 

I’d like to spend more time on Unruh Radiation, but its not something everyone agrees actually exists and it’s also hard to give a proper visualization for where the energy being emitted is coming from. 

I suppose, for those of you who saw the Hawking Radiation video and remember my explanation in terms of Virtual Particles, it would be probably be decently accurate to think of it in those terms. 

There we said that right over the surface of an event horizon, same as everywhere else in the Universe, virtual particles are constantly popping up in pairs and usually annihilating with each other almost instantly, but every so often one ends up on the other side of an event horizon before this can happen and the other sails off as a now real particle with real radiation. 

On small black holes in particular this is very powerful because right over that event horizon the change in gravitational force from even a tiny extra distance can be monstrous, and rip the virtual particle pair apart as the one slightly closer gets yanked away. 

Here you could think of it in similar terms, since gravity and acceleration are, again, pretty much the same thing. 

If that event horizon rolling behind you is separating virtual particle pairs before they can reunite and mutually annihilate then the ones on your side of that horizon are acting just like the escaping Hawking Radiation of Black Hole. 

Either way, while the Unruh effect is debated, and we’ve never actually seen Hawking Radiation either, the same physical models that are letting the warp drive work strongly indicate the interior of that warp bubble is getting blasted with huge amounts of Hawking Radiation or its equivalent. 

Now if we can get around that or its wrong, if we can keep the fields stable, and if negative mass exists, there’s still two more problems with the concept. 

First is that you’re probably collecting an awful lot of energy at the front of the ship, and some feel that when the ship decelerates that energy is going to slam forward and hit your destination with planet destroying forces… I don’t consider that a problem really, don’t aim your ship exactly at your final destination, and as we’ve discussed in the past even a regular old sub-light ship traveling at relativistic speeds can just jettison some of its garbage before slowing down and expect tit to whack into the planet ahead like a bunch of nuclear bombs. 

Plus it makes a handy weapon, and an FTL one, so while it’s a concern it has nothing to do with the functionality of the concept and just about every technology brings in new concerns for destructive use. 

The second and last one for today is only applicable to certain versions of the warp drive but brings up an interesting point in terms of the Fermi Paradox, which we spend a lot of time discussing on this channel. 

There’s a concern where you need to pre-place matter along the path to get this warp effect to work at all, sort of like a railroad track. 

Now that’s fine in and of itself, it’s great for the Fermi Paradox since as I discussed in the Dyson dilemma and Compendium the Fermi Paradox is a whole lot worse when you bring FTL into things but if you have to make the first trip at slower than light speed to allow you to get there and back in the future at FTL speeds it isn’t really a problem for the Fermi Paradox. 

Aliens can’t just pop across intergalactic distances without building the track first. 

But it does limit the utility of the Warp Drive since it means you have to get to new destinations the first time the hard way, and we’ll see this again when discussing wormholes in the case where you have to make the opening and the exit next to each other and then tow them to their final destinations at sub-light speeds. 

But that’s still makes it very useful. 

The problem is that in some analyses of this, the only way to properly pre-place these masses actually requires you have a working FTL drive to begin with, and if that turns out to be true you have a Catch-22, you can’t make a FTL highway without already having a FTL highway there. 

Of course the idea of using regular old mass, or preferably dark matter if you can find a way to manipulate it, in big long conduits that would contract space around them and let you send things along them seemingly faster as a sort of pseudo-FTL highway or Telegraph, is nothing new either and something we’ll look at more in the future too, and they also have the issue that you have to go there the long way the first time, but without any Catch-22. 

So if we can come up with negative mass, if we don’t need whole planets worth of it, if it turns out we can keep the field stable and either there is no Hawking-Unruh Radiation burning you, and if you can build one without need to pre-position mass or at least without needing a FTL ship to preposition it, then we finally do have a working faster than light ship. 

And the good news is NASA is doing some basic proof of concept of the idea, articles you’ve seen on this tend to over-hype that a lot and view it way too optimistically but it is being done and promises some interesting new data regardless. 

So that’s the Warp Drive, so far our best candidate for FTL. 

Next time we’ll look at another, more familiar FTL system when we look at wormholes, which we’ll see also need negative mass to work and will bring us back to look at the time travel problems we saw last time. 

That video will be a little while as we take an initial look at Transhumanism technologies and concepts next week and then a trip back to the Fermi Paradox to look at the Simulation Hypothesis, the notion that we might be living inside a giant computer simulation. 

After that we have a number of subjects in the queue that might come before or after the wormhole video but it will probably be at least three to six weeks before we get there.

The Fermi Paradox Compendium
---
  
2016-04-29  
https://youtu.be/rDPj5zI66LA  

---

Today we’re going to be taking a look at the Fermi Paradox, the apparent contradiction between the sheer size and age of the Universe and the seeming absence of any other intelligent life in it besides what resides on our own little blue dot. 

As big and old as the Universe is, we’d expect life to have popped up elsewhere many times and frequently long before it did here on Earth, yet we’ve never found a single bit of evidence of it. 

That’s the Fermi Paradox and down the years a lot of explanations have been suggested. 

This isn’t our first visit to the topic, but I felt it was time to redo the original video to look at some areas we skimmed over in the original video. 

Our goal today is to look at every solution we know of that’s either considered pretty logically consistent or popular and to look at the strengths and weaknesses of each proposed solution. 

To do that, and to do that in anything approaching a reasonable period of time even by the standards of this channel, we will have to move through material pretty quickly, which is why some of these subjects have their own separate videos and while you’ll often see little white and yellow boxes popping up with video links. 

And since some folks find me hard to understand, you may want to turn on the closed caption subtitles for this video, which is usually right down there by the subscribe button. 

Also, while there are probably about a hundred Fermi Paradox solutions I’m personally familiar with, an awful lot of them resemble each other greatly and share many or all of the same strengths weaknesses, so I will be lumping them together into categories and sub-categories. 

As I said in the original video, any given categorization system is going to be pretty arbitrary, so I’ve gone ahead and changed them up a little this time around. 

Our 4 categories remain basically the same even if the sub-categories have not. 

Those were: Category #1: Alien Civilizations are Rare, so we haven’t detected them. 

Life, or at least intelligent life, just isn’t very common in the Universe. 

We can’t see it because there just isn’t much to see, maybe none at all. 

This has quite a few variations including everything from even simple life being incredibly uncommon to technological civilizations self-destructing. 

Category #2: Alien Civilizations aren’t Rare, but we can’t detect them. 

Now this is broad zone, and often touches into category #1 too since many of the solutions still assume Alien Civilizations aren’t super common. 

They don’t talk to us because they don’t want to, they see it as a waste of time, they don’t want to interfere in our culture, they all talk using something better than radio signals, they don’t even talk to each other, and many others. 

This is probably the broadest category in terms of solutions. 

Category #3: Alien Civilizations aren’t rare, but we can’t recognize them. 

I use the word recognize here in both of its usual meanings. 

First, we might mean something so alien we can’t even tell it’s intelligent, or second, we might not recognize them in terms of acknowledging them officially. 

This is the category for the very bizarre aliens or for aliens walk among us but we don’t believe it. 

Category #4: Miscellaneous Self-Explanatory. 

Some of the stuff in this category just doesn’t fit into the others, or maybe could but is better off with its own separate mention. 

Last time I spent most of it in Category 2 and 4 was the runner up, in this updated version I want to spend more time on number Category 1, especially the first two sub-categories. 

We’re gonna be here for a while so a snack and a drink might be advisable, but with no further ado, let’s talk category 1. 

Category #1: Alien Civilizations are rare. 

This is the broad category that rests on the idea that our lack of evidence of aliens is simply due to them just not being very common. 

Quite a few of the solutions in other categories assume they’re not very common too but that’s a relative term and not their main argument. 

For category #1, that is the main argument, but it still breaks down into multiple sub-categories, in this version of the video I’ve broken it into 4. 

Category 1A: Rare Earth Life itself is incredibly rare, because planets that can birth and support life long enough for it to evolve are rare. 

Category 1B: The Great Filter This extends on the notion planets that can support life are rare, but places bigger focus on the improbabilities of intelligent life evolving and developing technology. 

Category 1C: Civilizations don’t last long This category usually assumes technological civilizations aren’t too common in the first place, but that few if any will last long before destroying themselves, and not long enough to get out and colonize other stars. 

Category 1D: Intelligent Life is not naturally occurring This tends to be the catch all area for solutions that revolve around the notion that either life itself or intelligent life specifically is either astronomically improbable or outright impossible to form on its own. 

Now as we begin exploring these notions I’m going bring in a counter. 

Every time I bring up an item which might plausibly be unlikely in the development of technological civilizations that have gotten themselves out into space to colonize it, I’ll add one to a counter. 

For instance, some stars may simply be inimical to life ever forming there because they put out a lard of hard radiation. 

Now this counter we’ll use at the end for our own hit on Drake’s Equation, not in a rigorous fashion though because we’ll just assume every hit on the counter is a coin flip odds, 50/50 proposition. 

Some of these probably are way less likely than that, such as a solar system have an Earth mass planet in the habitable zone, others might be better than 50/50, like the evolution of multi-cellular life which appears to have happened several times independently on Earth. 

We’ll just handwave them all as averaging out to 50/50 since this is only to illustrate a point. 

And we’ll talk a bit more about Drake’s Equation at the end of category #1 as well. 

Unfortunately we’ll really going to have speed through these because I got up 12 pages or thirty minutes of video on them just giving brief descriptions so we’ll be bypassing that in favor of me just stating the obvious ones. 

But I want to emphasize, while I don’t always agree with the reasoning or probability for some of these, nothing went on this list unless without a good reason, and I’ll add more details on the slides but you’d likely need to pause the video unless you’re a speed reader. 

Also, while some of these massively drop the odds, acting as an actual hurdle you can’t pass, whereas other fundamentally put a time on things. 

If you don’t develop it in time, your planet burns up. 

The Sun has five billion years left before it goes red giant, but stars get progressively hotter as they age and we’d estimate Earth will be uninhabitable in as little as three hundred million more years. 

Keep in mind that while the world has been around for 4.5 billion years and life for all but maybe the first 4-500 hundred million of that, the first land life and first simple brains only developed about that long ago. 

If our sun was just 5% more massive, it’s lifetime would have shrunk enough to render Earth uninhabitable by now. 

So time’s a factor, and since in the long term evolution can be thought of as a statistical process where X number of mutations need to occur, anything that makes an organism take longer between generations, or decreases the number of those organisms and therefore increases the timeline for those mutations to occur on average has to be considered a filter itself. 

Colder worlds, or smaller worlds, would probably have this problem, and while plenty of stars live longer than our own, in fact most do, besides having their own unique problems supporting life, might not have developed complex life yet. 

Okay let’s get started. 

Category 1A: Rare Earth Life itself is incredibly rare, because planets that can birth and support life long enough for it to evolve are rare. 

Earth is quite different from its neighboring planets, and our solar system differs from its neighbors, likely every solar system in the Universe is unique to some degree. 

But over the years we’ve noted a lot of features of our planet and solar system and even our area of the galaxy which might make life easier here than most places. 

Now a lot of these individual points are debated, and it’s very hard to apply a genuine probability to many of them which is why we’ll be using our handwave of 50/50. 

Now I don’t always agree with the odds on these, but as mentioned I usually won’t add one unless someone has written a pretty convincing treatment on it and usually one making it was worse than 50/50 The Rare Earth Hypothesis holds that all of these add up to an improbability that is very high. 

Now as I mentioned, all categories are somewhat arbitrary, so it isn’t like our second sub-category, great filters, doesn’t include these more physical barriers to life or that Rare Earth bypasses the evolutionary ones, nor do other categories ignore them, but its more about the key focus. 

So what could make Earth abnormally hospitable to life, well let’s zoom in from universe scale. 

1. 

Old enough galaxies – Many early galaxies are very active, with stuff like quasars, that would make life anywhere in it tough at best, and they take different time to settle down. 

2. 

No metals – Build up of heavy elements from Supernovae takes a while and is lower in the outer rims of galaxies. 

3. 

Too much galactic radiation – The places near the center, with the most metals, are saturated with hard radiation. 

4. 

Galactic Dead Zones – The core isn’t the only place with too much radiation, or too high a density of stars for stable solar systems to be likely. 

5. 

Stable Galactic orbit – Lots of solar systems wander the galaxy in much more elliptical orbits than us, popping in and out of those danger zones. 

6. 

Wrong sun – Big stars don’t live long enough, small ones have their own problems, especially much smaller red dwarfs as we looked at in the Habitbale Planets Series. 

7. 

Sun fluctuates too much – A big one, our sun is freakishly stable in its power output compared to most stars. 

8. 

Solo sun – Life around binary stars is plausible but it does have problems. 

9. 

Habitable Zone – Loosely defined as where it’s not too hot and not too cold for liquid water, unsurprisingly known as the Goldilocks Zone, needless to most planets aren’t in it. 

10. 

Stable Habitable Zone – As I mentioned, stars get hotter with time, and the habitable zone moves, a planet needs to be in it the whole time. 

11. 

Eccentric Orbit – Planets orbit in ellipses, not circles, if you’re too elliptical you freeze at aphelion and burn at perihelion. 

12. 

Vacuum Cleaner Jupiter – Solar Systems have a lot of debris, getting hit by it can sterilize a planet, big gas giant out beyond your planet can minimize this by sucking them up. 

13. 

No Hot Jupiters - If you’ve got a big planet close to the Sun it can seriously screw with the orbits of other planets nearby in the habitable zone. 

We’ve found tons of these, so they’re not rare. 

14. 

Asteroid strikes – Plenty gets past your Jovian Vacuum Cleaner, if its big enough it can sterilize a planet, not just kill off a lot of stuff, and we think one considerably bigger did hit us to make the moon. 

15. 

Large Moons – Traditionally a popular Great Filter, we now have reason to believe rocky planets with large moons might be as common as 1 in 10, but its value to life remains unchanged, especially the effect on tides and tectonics. 

16. 

Making Large Moons – That collision theory for the moon being created and the huge heat pulse involved, along with the stripping of the primordial crust being tossed into orbit, is also a fairly popular new Great Filter. 

We might be nothing but a water covered planet otherwise with no real plate tectonics. 

17. 

Not Enough Plate Tectonics 18. 

Too much Tectonics 19. 

Planet too massive – High gravity, thick atmosphere, probably deeper oceans, sunlight might not get through for photosynthesis and there may be little or no land. 

20. 

Planet not massive enough - In the Terraforming video we discussed the problems with keeping an atmosphere on lighter worlds, and while Venus has a way thicker atmosphere than Earth doesn’t make it easier for complex life to dwell there, and there’s very little hydrogen and water on Venus compared to Earth. 

Too little gravity means less water, or a colder planet to keep that hydrogen, like Mars. 

21. 

Magnetic Field - Planets needs these both to protect from radiation and to keep their atmospheres, or at least their hydrogen. 

Ours is produced by a large and molten core. 

It need not be a lot weaker to make life a lot harder. 

22. 

Rotation rate - Our planet used to spin about twice as fast, with twelve hour days, and we have the moon to thank for slowing that down. 

If a planet spins too fast it will have much more violent weather and subsequently erosion. 

Too much erosion, land disappears, and maybe more importantly topsoil does. 

23. 

Oxygen absorption – Oxygen is highly reactive, and early on, when it was poisonous to life, it got sequestered into rock and water. 

A change in a planet’s crustal composition and turnover could prevent oxygen being absorbed fast enough to prevent life from being poisoned to death or keep being absorbed so there’s never enough oxygen to serve as a fuel to aerobic life. 

So that’s Rare Earth. 

If you’re curious we’re up to 23 coin flips, and the odds of getting heads 23 times in a row is about one in 8 million, that would happen about 50,000 times in a galaxy of 400 billion star like our own. 

Now those favoring planetary conditions as the main bar for life developing will, quite fairly, point out that my 50/50 standard here is overall way too kind. 

Many of these would be more like 1 in 100, worth 6 or 7 coin flips on their own. 

If we said these were more like 1 in 6, the odds on dice, not 50/50 coin flips, well 6^23 is about 800 quadrillion, which is about three times as many stars as are within a billion light years of us, or from which we’ve received light less than a billion years old. 

So this camp is hardly without its merits. 

Now as I mentioned there’s no cut off between Rare earth and our next category, the Great Filter, so those who feel physical conditions aren’t quite enough just keep going into those. 

Category 1B, the Great Filter, often actually refers to a single specific hurdle that is the biggest problem for life developing, but just as often means many of them. 

One of those previously mentioned conditions might be 1 in 1000 while 10 other were 50/50 and that lone filter, 1 in 1000, would knock out just as many competitors as those other 10 combined. 

Sometimes someone will mean a great filter, one of these filters thought to be especially low odds, but usually it is just meant as the sum total, and today I’m using it mostly to describe evolutionary hurdles, biological or maybe more sociological near the end. 

Okay, We left off at 23, let’s continue. 

24. 

Abiogenesis – We still aren’t sure how it happened or where, popular candidates are tidal pools, underwater thermal vents, and even outer space. 

We know it ought to take a decent chemical soup with some sort of energy flux through it, and probably many concentrations and mixtures can do it but not likely all with similar odds. 

It might be some mixtures are way less likely, astronomically so, then very similar ones, to produce life. 

I’ve seen some attempts to calculate this, but they’re pretty weak one often cited write-up used the entire volume of the ocean, not tidal pools or the volume near underwater vents, then still had the ocean volume 1000x times higher than it was then or now, one of the reasons why peer-review is so important. 

25. 

Staying alive, from what we can tell the conditions on Earth when abiogenesis happened were nothing like now, and life has to make that conversion or die, the way the earth was back then would not be hospitable to complex life. 

26. 

Simplest cells - Protocells, the boundary in many eyes between living and non-living material, revolves around the cell wall or membrane, and it is now thought to be the first step, with lots of interesting research on the subject in the last decade even showing how the assembly of these membranes would logically act in a Darwinian manner. 

27. 

Prokaryotes - Cells with no nucleus or organelles, these are still light years more advanced then self-replicating molecules or even proto-cells, and they took a long time to develop, so again our slower generations or smaller population concern of slowing things down is a concern. 

28. 

Photosynthesis. 

Our planet, and our modern ecosystem, gets virtually all its energy from the sun. 

Until life learns to convert sunlight directly into a power source it is going very small and small. 

It’s a lot easier to have a lottery winner out of a million people who play every day than a thousand people who play once a year. 

And many worlds might never get there because their atmospheres are too thick and cloudy for sunlight to penetrate, or conversely because their atmosphere is too thin and magnetic field too weak, so that life gets blasted by radiation if tries to exist where sunlight reaches. 

Photosynthesis is often viewed as a strong filter not because it is an improbable mutation, there are many routes to many different types of photosynthesis, but rather because on many worlds it will not be practical to develop. 

29. 

Eukaryotes. 

It is a big step to go from a simple cell to one with a nucleus and even more specialized parts. 

Eukaryotes in addition to that nucleus have organelles, specialized machines that do jobs that would not let them survive without being part of that interdependent totality. 

Indeed, mitochondria, a vital component of modern cells, isn’t even a true part of the cells they are in. 

30. 

Colony organism and Multi-cellular life. 

Complex life is a pretty arbitrary concept, but this is often the line drawn for it. 

At some point you begin getting serious cooperation between cells. 

This is not a good Fermi Paradox filter though since we believe this has happened independently on Earth many times, but its still a good inclusion because it adds a lot of time. 

Even if it would probably be a common and near inevitable route for life to take, it will add many mutations and generations to get there and introduces its own survival problems like cancer. 

31. 

Oxygen crisis - As I mentioned earth didn’t always have an oxygen nitrogen atmosphere, and its initial emergence was as a poison, a waste product of life mostly tied to photosynthesis. 

32. 

Oxygen breathing – Breathing oxygen is a huge advantage, like photosynthesis, learning to live with oxygen as an anaerobic organism isn’t the same as learning to breathe it. 

33. 

Sexual Reproduction - This is a big one, and still quite a mystery especially in the male and female divergence, rather than just organisms that were non-gendered but just reproduced with others rather than sub-dividing. 

When you share DNA you share mutations. 

If a cell starts off subdividing, and 20 generations there’s a million of them of which two have developed a handy and non-mutually exclusive mutation, they can’t share that mutation without some way of stealing each other’s genes. 

34. 

Food Chains - An often overlooked one, but an important one since you need a certain density of life for this to be advantageous. 

Hard to live as a predator without a decent amount of prey. 

Our ability to eat other organisms for compact high energy fuel is a major advantage, and a double whammy to lower energy worlds since they not only would have slower evolution from smaller baseline populations and longer generations but would have problems supporting food chains. 

There’s no advantage to eating others if you have to expend more energy going and finding them to eat them then you derive from eating them. 

35. 

Land life - Life on land took quite a while, and as mentioned, it happened about as long ago as we have left before the world is uninhabitable. 

No land life, no fire, no technology. 

36. 

Brains, brains, brains… as mentioned these only started emerging about the same time land life emerged, and even those very simple brains were a big deal. 

We’ll come back to brains again, but the simplest forms of them are a huge advantage. 

37. 

Parents – Now obviously you’ve got this the moment you’ve got sexual reproduction and arguably before, but organisms that actually care for their young and opt for a fewer children, more investment per child route is a major and non-obvious step in evolution. 

38. 

Families – Another big step for eventual civilizations, not just parents who guard their eggs or watch over their young for a few days but actual families where the parent or parents tend their young for a long while and frequently stay together their whole life as a cooperative pack. 

39. 

Tool use 40. 

Language 41. 

Fire – This is actually a big one since there is NO TECHNOLOGY without it. 

Yet fire on worlds with lower or higher oxygen could be useless or horribly dangerous, and many creatures gain little from it, and fire is always dangerous. 

42. 

Caring for your elderly – Once you have language actually feeding your elderly gives you someone to watch and teach your children who has a lifetime of skills but otherwise might not be too useful for gathering food. 

43. 

Farming – You just can’t achieve the kind of population densities associated to civilization as hunter-gatherers and what’s more it lets you be stationary, meaning you don’t have to carry all your possessions around, like your harvest. 

Food stockpiles let you support more people simply by having reserves for bad seasons or years. 

Of course some planets might not even have noticeable seasons, which sounds good, no hard winters, but necessity is the mother of invention. 

44. 

Metal – Metal isn’t as initially useful as people assume, a good stone blade is actually sharper than anything but our best modern steel, and you need some serious technology to make steel. 

We’ve been using fire to make pottery for 30,000 years, yet even copper wasn’t in use till 3000 BC. 

That’s 25,000 years of using fire to cook food and clay vessels before figuring out metal. 

Remember these folks are us now, just as smart, so if they needed that long to invent basic metallurgy it can’t be an easy step. 

45. 

Writing – Unless these critters have near perfect memories, which would require an even more expensive brain, you need a recordable language for complex civilizations. 

46. 

Law &amp; Custom – A weird one, but once civilizations arise you need rules for dealing with strangers with some degree of trust normally afforded only your lifelong tribe members. 

I’m using this as a catch all for everything from legal codes to money to etiquette, and if that last seems silly, think how we often react to those with bad or just foreign manners. 

47. 

Scholars and Philosophy – Having people who devote their whole life to learning things which have no immediate use, knowledge for its own sake, is an expensive thing and a big jump past the tribal elders and shamans, one that’s often been rejected. 

48. 

Science – You almost have to be trained formally in this to really appreciate how counter-intuitive a thinking process this is. 

And how offensive it can be to authority. 

People don’t appreciate when you tell them their folk medicine is wrong when they also have people who sincerely swear it saved their life. 

49. 

Now we have two more that will give us an even fifty, coincidentally but conveniently, but they are for our last category. 

49 is not destroying ourselves with nukes and such and… 50. 

We actually colonize space. 

Most members of the Great Filter camp do include those last two but I feel they merit their own category. 

Incidentally I don’t have an official camp I’m in but I tilt heavily to the Great Filter, 1B, as do most scientists I know who have spent time on the subject. 

That mean I’m biased of course but here’s why: We came up with 50 coin flips, and with just our 50/50 odds, that would mean to get to the end of the list you’d have to get heads 50 times in a row. 

The odds of that are less than 1 in a Quadrillion, that’s about how many stars are within 150 million light years of us. 

1 civ per every several thousand galaxies, and if we kick that up to using dice again, 1 in 6, that is 10^39, trillions of time more stars than in the entire known Universe. 

Needless to say, even that 50/50 odds is pretty high and makes intelligent life anywhere close enough for us to see very unlikely. 

Even my extension on this, the Companion Video the Dyson Dilemma, which lets us hunt for galaxy-spanning civilizations a billion light years away, only requires that lower-end coin-flip odds to be right to be justified. 

The flaw of course, for both our first two sub-categories, is that we don’t know what those odds are. 

Drake’s equation, the loose and arguably outdated formula for calculating the odds of detecting intelligent life, operates by plugging in all the probabilities, squished up into more broad categories, but one flaw of it, from a perception standpoint, is that we do have good guesses for many of these variables in Drake’s equation and we tend to assume the one’s we don’t are equivalent. 

That’s a thinking flaw along the lines of calculating the odds someone will have, let’s say, a nice plaque on the wall. 

If I tell you the odds of them having that Plaque depend on four factors, A, B, C, and D, and I then tell you A, B and C are all about 1 in 10 each, you will tend to think D must be too, for about a 1 in 10,000 chance and figure out of seven billion people there must be hundreds of thousands with that plaque. 

If I now tell you A is the odds of being an athletically inclined male, B is living in a colder hilly environment, and C is enjoying the hobby of skiing, all seems well, but when I next tell you that we’re solving for the number of people who have a gold medal in Men’s Alpine Skiing you now realize why it isn’t hundreds of thousands, and why D, getting into and winning the Winter Olympics, is not a 1 in 10 option. 

One of the reason we went through that long list was to emphasize why you need to distrust your intuition when looking at Drake’s Equation. 

Rare Earth and Great Filter approaches both argue some of these variables are much, much lower than others. 

Moving on to Category 1C, civilizations don’t last long, is often better phrased as including the notion that they don’t go out and take an interest in the galaxy, as the Fermi Paradox is about spotting these guys, which is hard to do if they blow themselves up and much easier to do if they expand out into the galaxy or like to talk to others, or shoot missiles at them. 

I separate this from the prior 2 sub-categories because steps 49 and 50, not blowing ourselves up and colonizing the galaxy, are steps ahead of us, not behind. 

A lot of folks like this camp because it lets us assume getting where we are now isn’t very uncommon. 

I don’t, and honestly probably a third of the videos on this channel examine the notion. 

I consider it needlessly pessimistic and actually quite unreasonably so. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if quite a few civilizations did blow themselves up or did decide interstellar colonization wasn’t for them, but I would be surprised if virtually all did and its hard for me to imagine that if intelligent civilizations are so common that they pop up around only even 1 in a million stars, meaning there’d be nearly half a million in the galaxy, that not a single one of them managed to both not kill themselves off and stay at home. 

We talked about this more in the Dyson Dilemma but we spent a good half hour discussing #49, self-obliteration, in the Apocalypse How video and we’ll be looking at that more in the Carter Doomsday Argument where we’ll also look at some of the more strange ways civilizations could take themselves out. 

For #50, colonizing space, we have a whole series on this channel that looks at how you could do it, looking at everything from Moonbases to Terraforming and Interstellar Colonization, and we talked about why you would, and why it would be very hard not to, in the Dyson Dilemma. 

But the fundamental argument of this camp is that technological civilizations find ever more potent ways to blow themselves up, get ever-better at making those easier for smaller groups or even individuals to get their hands on, and tend to have more and more people out of which lunatics for instance might pop up who would cheerfully kill everyone. 

Needless to say this was a very popular camp on the Fermi Paradox during the Cold War, especially before we landed on the Moon, and even though the Cold War is over, we have figured out more way to kill ourselves and we haven’t been back to the Moon, let alone established colonies on it or other planets, in nearly 50 years. 

You can check out the aforementioned videos if you want the various counter arguments. 

Category 1D will finish out our first category, and it is the notion that life, or intelligent life, just doesn’t even occur naturally. 

That it can only happen through events so implausible it is less likely than not to occur during the entire existence of the Universe and the entire extent of the Universe. 

Obvious inclusions would be God did it, or Aliens from some prior Universe or external reality did it, or that we are living in a computer simulation, from a practical standpoint these are all equivalent statements. 

We look at this more in the Simulation Hypothesis video so I’ll gloss over it now to save us time. 

The big weakness of them is not the obvious one, lack of evidence, every Fermi Paradox solutions suffers from that. 

Their weakness is that they’re not internally provable. 

God or the great programmer in the Lab Above can pop in and tell us they made us, we can’t force them to tell us and in fact they could easily just upload the last stable version of the Universe if they did drop the ball and accidentally give away the show. 

As to life just being astronomically improbable anywhere in the universe, we have only the Anthropic principle, the reminder that only universes where we won the tiny freak odds to exist will actually include anyone who can notice that. 

Doesn’t matter if the odds of life anywhere in the universe are 1 in 2 or 1 in a gajillion, only Universes where someone won the lotto will have anyone around to notice it. 

And there’s always a finite chance for life, no mater what else there’s a chance of particles randomly assembling into not just self-replicating molecules but a full-blown intelligent creature, called a Boltzmann Brain. 

Now the strength of 1D is the same as its weakness, it hard to disprove. 

Even arguments like ‘Why would God, or the Great Programmer, make a giant Universe for one species?’ don’t hold up very well for the same reason a few bacteria in the middle of a Petri Dish would be wrong to assume there must be more bacteria elsewhere in the Petri Dish. 

We put them in for them to grow, we don’t care that it will take a few hours or days for them to fill it up. 

So that’s category 1, we haven’t seen aliens because they are terribly uncommon. 

The shared strength is that its logically consistent, there’s no huge gaps in it, it’s big weakness is that lack of evidence weighed against the sheer size of the Universe and the Mediocrity Principle, the notion that when you have only one example of something you should assume it’s a pretty normal or mediocre case. 

Category 1 can rub people the wrong way exactly for that reason, the other name of the mediocrity principle is the Copernican Principle, and Copernicus is the guy who got us thinking we weren’t the center of the Universe, that we can’t think that way when trying to be rational and objective, and so Category 1 seems to fly in the face of this core and founding principle of science. 

Okay, let’s finally advance to our second category, the notion that aliens aren’t that uncommon we just can’t see them. 

Now as I said with category 1, it isn’t that people in one category camp think life is necessarily super-common, many category 2 folks do subscribe to category 1 thinking but it isn’t the focus of their Fermi Paradox solution. 

I divide Category 2 also into 4 sub-categories, though quite a few of the special cases we’ll look at in the Miscellanous category arguably fit in here too. 

Category 2A: They Talk, but we can’t hear them Category 2B: There hasn’t been enough time for us to hear them Category 2C: They don’t talk, because they have no reason to, and Category 2D: They don’t talk, and they actively hide also Category 2A, that they talk but we can’t hear them, can be looked at both from the SETI Institute perspective, that we need bigger ears and patience to pick up their signals, and also the general notion that they talk using a means we can’t listen to. 

This would include both mundane methods like using directional lasers rather than omnidirectional signals, and that they use some faster-than-light method we can’t pickup, same as how guys in the 18th century wouldn’t know we talked by radio waves. 

Now this is a very popular Fermi Paradox camp, and quite probably the largest amongst those who are just giving the matter casual thought. 

Unfortunately it has a couple big weaknesses on examination. 

The big one is the absence of what we call teaching beacons, or sometimes Benford Beacons for James and Gregory Benford. 

Basically the notion that any civilization that wants to be heard can be heard. 

A friendly civilization that wants to broadcast so that radio-capable civilizations can hear them can yell loudly enough to be heard galaxies away even using an omnidirectional old fashioned radio signal. 

And even if for some reason not every civilization develops radio on their path to the stars most will, its pretty much impossible not to figure out how radio works and use it for astronomy if nothing else and still get yourself up to Space Flight technology. 

So most civilizations will know it’s a common method of sending signals. 

That’s an example of exclusivity, another thing we’ll bring up a lot in category 2. 

It is maybe possible someone could become spacefaring without understanding either electromagnetism or math, but it’s not very likely, spacefaring can be considered a trait exclusive to species that understand those two things. 

Alternatively we couldn’t say you need to be Capitalist or Communist, Oligarchic or Democratic, Religious or Atheist, to get into space since on Earth the first two groups that did it were the US and Soviet Union. 

So we’d say that the trait of spacefaring is NOT exclusive to any given political, religious, or economic system. 

That will come up a lot, this non-exclusivity concept, in many of the Fermi Paradox solutions after category 1 because many of those solutions rightfully look at means and motive for expansion or communication, and if you can’t argue that spacefaring is exclusive to that behavior it doesn’t hold up well. 

We’re never interested in how one single species would act, where that action would leave them undetected, if we can assume others won’t act that way and be detected. 

Now for radio signaling this also assumes they haven’t got something better, but again would only work if they only want to talk to those who also have it, akin to the Prime Directive form Star Trek. 

That sort of notion we’ll address in the Miscellaneous section, that they don’t talk to primitives on principle. 

If that ethical issue isn’t in play, waiting doesn’t make much sense when you can just send them blueprints for a way to talk. 

This of course assumes they have something better than radio. 

And by better again we could mean directed lasers, but what people usually mean is Faster Than Light communication. 

Now we’ve got a series focusing on that subject, and there are some ways it might maybe be possible, but the current thinking is that it is not, and it really only makes thing worse if it is. 

Faster than Light Travel or communication comes up a lot with the Fermi Paradox and it pretty much only ever makes it worse. 

If you can leap from star to star in days not years, or instantly, besides being able to visit or colonize places very easily you can also just dump local satellites near inhabited planets chirping out a hello and instructions for how to contact them if you want to. 

And you might think deploying a satellite around every star in the galaxy, or just the ones you’ve noticed have advanced life on them, is a hard task, but when we’re talking advanced civilizations it would barely count as a minor budgetary item. 

I haven’t mentioned the Kardashev Scale yet, I don’t actually likely it as scale because it very narrow spectrum and all about energy, but it’s a popular term for describing high tech civilizations. 

We would rate as about a .8 or .9 on the scale, if we used all our planets energy we’d be a 1, if we used our whole sun’s energy, like with a Dyson Sphere, we’d be 2, and using a whole galaxy’s power output gets you a 3. 

A Kardashev 2, or K2, civilization, even with just our level of tech, could easily build a transmitter that you could pick up on your car radio and could churn out a trillion satellites like a G20 country could produce a box of pencils. 

A K2 civilization is usually assumed to have about a billion to a trillion times as many people as us, and a K3 about the same to them. 

Meaning a K2 civilization could also devote a hundred astronomers to watching each and every star in their own galaxy and still only use about one millionth of their population doing it. 

The United states, population 320 million, employs more than 320 astronomers, it’s actually about 20 times higher, at 7000. 

We usually assume advanced civilizations can devote more people proportionally to scholastic pursuits too. 

That’s worth remembering when we get to Category 2D, aliens hide, when we contemplate that anyone trying to hide from a K2+ civilization knows that not even including any technological advantage they have, they’re trying to hide from people who can casually devote several thousand times the entire human population to full time searching and still have such a small portion of their population performing this task that most of their own people will never have met someone who does that job. 

So the strength of category 2A is basically that it plays to our ignorance. 

We don’t know much about the Universe yet so it isn’t outrageous to think we don’t know how the grown ups like to talk and they can’t be bothered to talk to us, and again it doesn’t exclude that life might still be pretty uncommon too. 

The weakness is just that, we’re not that ignorant, and we do actually like to talk to people who are, exactly because we do not think ignorance on a given subject equates to stupidity. 

We highly value knowledge and talking with others, that could easily be a pair of traits which are exclusive for space faring since a value for knowledge and sharing and conversation would seem pretty important to developing technology. 

Again we’ll discuss the notion that they feel morally obliged not to talk to us in the Miscellaneous category but the notion that they wouldn’t find us interesting enough to talk to when it would be at most a miniscule inconvenience just doesn’t hold water, though we’ll look at it a bit more in 2C. 

Before that we’ve got 2B, there just hasn’t been enough time for us to hear them yet. 

Now fundamentally this is the SETI Institute line of reasoning. 

Aliens aren’t very common, probably not expansionist into space, and probably don’t go to huge efforts to talk loudly. 

This is a very strong line of reasoning especially if you tend to tilt toward category 1C, that civilizations don’t last long or expand. 

It also assumes Faster Than Light travel isn’t very likely. 

Light takes a long to get anywhere and signal strength falls of with the inverse square of distance, double the distance, quarter the signal strength, ten times the distance, a hundredth the strength. 

It’s also temporary, only on while transmitting plus light lag. 

It’s like detecting wave from dropping pebbles on the far side of a large pond. 

You need to be looking closely at the right place at the right time to spot them. 

I said a couple minutes ago that anyone who wanted to be heard could be heard galaxies away, but I’m assuming someone who has past the Kardashev-1 stage of things. 

A transmitter that can be easily heard across an entire galaxy takes absurd amounts of power, tiny for a K2 civilization and infinitesimal for a K3 but a lot compared to what we use nowadays. 

You have to be around long enough to have an established infrastructure in outer space to do stuff like this. 

If everyone is only transmitting at the megawatt scale and only for a few centuries each you could easily have millions of species popping up to our tech level, transmitting for a few centuries then dying off before building anything bigger or talking long enough for someone else nearby to pop up and hear them. 

The Hart Conjecture, and Hart-Tipler Conjecture, which we talked about more in the Dyson Dilemma, thud into this by arguing that it should be possible to expand out into space and that aliens will generally want to. 

If both are true Category 2B gets blown out of the water. 

Civilizations last a long time, indefinitely, and can absolutely talk loudly enough to be heard. 

So 2B is a good solution if you tilt toward the category 1C line of thinking but want to add on. 

Now there’s a non-scientific but valid argument against SETI out of this too, which basically argues that if every civilization ends up sitting around its own world till it dies, why would we even want to hear from them? 

That’s not an argument against it being true, but it is an argument against operating as though it was, since not only can they not give you any useful information on avoiding your own self-destruction if it inevitably happens to everyone, but listening to them could easily bring it about that much sooner when we pick up from them how to make some sort of really great technology, on the surface, that results in inevitable destruction when employed. 

Often called Honeypot or Suicide Pact technology I discussed this in the Apocalypse How Video in more detail. 

Now category 2C is the idea that aliens can talk to us, have no moral objection to doing so, but simply don’t want to. 

They have no reason to so don’t go to the effort. 

I’d argue this doesn’t work too well because it would seem weird any alien civilization, let alone every member of every civilization, don’t feel like talking to us. 

The usual analogy is that they look down on us like we do to ants. 

But that’s bad analogy considering we spend tons of money and research time studying ants and would talk to them if we could, and we talk to our pets all the time. 

And why would anyone stop someone who wanted to talk to technological primitives anyway? 

I mean we don’t encourage people to talk to their goldfish but we never ban it, since there’s no threat to us from them doing so. 

We are not afraid of goldfish, and advanced civilizations couldn’t plausibly be afraid of us. 

Now the other line of reasoning is that they just don’t value anything we have. 

That’s plausible from a purely rational line of reasoning, we can’t offer them better technology after all, but again it’s hard to imagine curiosity is a rare trait in spacefaring cultures. 

It might not be exclusive, no high technology without curiosity, but uncommon? 

Not likely, and again with such things it doesn’t matter if some do it, it matters that some don’t. 

A race, even most alien races, might be incredibly indifferent to primitive alien art and culture, but it’s hard to imagine there’s no anthropologists except the ones who live on earth. 

So I usually consider 2C a very weak Fermi Paradox Solution, and it’s not a popular one in terms of being vocally defended but it makes the list because it’s a common kneejerk suggestion, they just don’t have any reason to talk to us so they don’t. 

And again the idea that they are morally opposed to it, and therefore might stop anyone from doing it, from talking to us, we’ll look at in Category 4. 

Here we mean simple indifference as a motive, too much effort, not enough gain, no conversation, and the weakness is that curiosity ought to be a common trait in technological civilizations, so a massive lack of it would be strange. 

It also has the issue that it ignores that active communication isn’t our only way to detect people, technological civilizations leave a lot of fingerprints lying around too, which is very important to the next category. 

Category 2D is the idea that they do have a very strong reason for hiding from us and everyone else too. 

This is a very strong argument from a strictly biological standpoint but breakdown strategically. 

The reasoning goes like this. 

Nothing, nothing, not one single thing that claws its way up Darwin’s ladder is a wimp or idiot or indifferent to their own survival. 

If you’re walking around a dangerous park late at night the last thing you want to do is yell out “Hello, I’m weak and vulnerable, is anybody here?”, and the last thing you want to hear is “Yes, I’ll be right there”. 

Space is a big dark forest, and we tend to be worried about walking around being seen and heard because something big and scary might attack us. 

And it doesn’t help that we also know that one lone human walking around a forest at night can walk with confidence knowing they are the scariest, most dangerous thing in those woods. 

Our minds, combined with our technology from having those minds, makes us super-predators if we want to be, and that will be true for every other species. 

So it isn’t hard to imagine one that’s older and nastier might be hanging around listening and waiting to pounce. 

Maybe they hate all other aliens on principle, maybe they just don’t want to share and are ruthless. 

Maybe they’ve racked up so many acts of genocide that they feel they have to keep doing it just to make sure no one ever gets powerful enough to find out about their prior crimes and hold them accountable. 

Extrapolating from that, its not hard to reason that whatever benefits you might get from shouting out to the Universe hoping someone will reply, when all appears silent, don’t outweigh the risks of exposure. 

This is the main argument against METI, also called Active SETI, or Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligences. 

Now what’s wrong with it? 

Well basically that technological species aren’t wimps or idiots, they will understand strategy and silence isn’t a great one in the long term. 

Ask yourself what you would do if you were a species hellbent on wiping out everyone else. 

I know what I’d do, I’d expand my civilization like crazy to maximize my resources, infrastructure, manpower, and research pool. 

I’d push for a K2 civilization as fast as possible because as I mentioned earlier I could devote hundreds or even thousands of people to studying every single solar system for signs of life. 

Even if I didn’t expand outside of my own solar system for some reason, there is no such thing as a K2 civilization that could not detect us, as we are now, anywhere in the galaxy, and kill us from there. 

Just as you can build a transmitter powerful enough to be heard across the galaxy on people’s car radios, you can build a detector that can pick up our transmissions. 

You can also build a directed energy weapon, a Nicoll-Dyson Beam, able to blast whole planets on the other side of the galaxy and keep flicking that beam from world to world, hitting every planet in the galaxy in less than geological times. 

Nor do you have to wait for radio, you just burn any planet that looks like it might have life. 

This all assumes you aren’t just expanding and taking those worlds as your own, which would also seem the logical course of action. 

It’s also very hard to hide if you decide to do so. 

You leave fingerprints, your heat signature mostly, but without specifics the reasoning would be like a bronze age civilization trying to hide from us, they know they can’t, not forever, and they know when we find them all that effort they spent hiding could have been better directed at building up their own size, technology, and defenses. 

Spreading out to be less vulnerable, that sort of thing. 

So when a civilization has been hiding and not expanding when they could, spending uncountable resources trying to hide better while doing it, eventually someone will ask one of their generals. 

Probably a very good one too since such a civilization would presumably value strategic thinkers who could help them hide better. 

And he will say ‘this is futile, it’s been a million years we’ve been hiding and we’ve seen and heard nothing, either no one is out there or they are all cowering like we are. 

If someone wanted us dead they’d have had us so by now.’ Only in fiction do technologically and numerically superior enemies lose, especially if they are passionately dedicated to killing their enemy and don’t give a damn about collateral damage. 

So they stop hiding, and they get detected by other people hiding, who make the same decision and everyone starts talking. 

But it wouldn’t take a million years, we already know we’ve been detected by anyone with the desire to see us and close enough to care, and strong enough to hurt us, so we will never operate with the intention of hiding if it costs us anything, even just missed opportunities, because its wasted effort. 

That’s category 2D, aliens hide because they’re afraid of bigger predators. 

The big counterargument isn’t that they shouldn’t be because no one might have malicious intent, but rather that they shouldn’t bother because if anyone does hiding won’t help you. 

And that closes out category 2. 

The individual strengths vary but the key weakness is the same, it relies too heavily on people’s motivations and frequently breaks down when those lines are shown to be either logically flawed or violate the concept of Exclusivity by requiring behavior we have to reason to think would be present in all technological civilizations. 

Category 3 revolves around the notion that aliens exist but we can’t recognize them. 

And again I use the word recognize here in multiple senses, and also again we have 4 sub-categories. 

Category 3A: Aliens walk among us but hide themselves Category 3B: Aliens used to walk among us, and helped us develop civilization Category 3C: Aliens walk among us, don’t hide, but are so alien we literally don’t recognize them Category 3D: Aliens walk among us because we are aliens ourselves. 

Category 3A requires little explanation, in fact we’ll be flying through category 3 pretty fast compared to the last two. 

There’s no way you’re alive today and have access to Youube without having seen a hundred fictional examples of this and many people believe aliens walk among us. 

I’ve better things to do with my time that ridicule that belief, and it wouldn’t be fair to either, since unlike the other categories that so far have no proof or evidence either, this one actually does. 

The problem of course is that we don’t believe that evidence is valid. 

There’s tons of evidence for ghost and pixies and goblins too. 

But hard scientific evidence is lacking, and while it also is for the other categories they suffer from not being able to gather much evidence yet, whereas evidence for 3A, aliens among us, is lacking while it all takes place on the one spot in the Universe we actually can monitor and collect evidence from easily. 

Proving there’s an elephant or 900 pound gorilla in my living room is a lot easier than proving there’s one somewhere on the entire continent of Africa. 

The usual line of reasoning though is that government covers it up, and this was real popular in the 90’s. 

It’s kind of hard to imagine that every government conspires together to do this especially considering how crappy governments tend to be at keeping secrets. 

Now of course the conspiracy minded tend to think otherwise, and I obviously won’t sway them, but I also ask you to consider motive. 

I could give you a laundry list of reasons why no aliens need to hide among us if they have malicious intent, beginning with the simple fact that an interstellar capable species could flatten us like a bug, but I can’t think of any benign reason besides anthropology that they’d hang out here secretly and I wouldn’t think they’d chat with our government about it or feel a need to abduct people and perform proctology exams on them. 

Category 3B is the notion that aliens used to hang out here, usually pretending to be gods and helping us get started. 

Ancient Alien Astronauts, this was a concept popularized by the 1968 book Chariot of the Gods, and it’s a very popular notion. 

Tons and tons of fiction, often very good fiction too, revolves around this idea. 

But the problem is the evidence presented always involves things that we know our ancestors could have built. 

Contrary to popular belief we know and have known for a long while how to build the pyramids using that era of technology. 

We never thought it was impossible and the debate was over which of several possible methods they would have used. 

Great stuff too, it’s frankly amazing how innovative our ancestors were with their ancient monolith building and a subject I’d encourage you to read up on. 

That’s probably why this category rubs me personally the wrong way too. 

I dislike the notion of stealing away our ancestor’s accomplishments and dismissing them as stupid primitives by saying they needed external help from aliens. 

But that’s a matter of opinion and bias I suppose. 

Evidence-wise there’s two problems. 

First is that none of those things require advanced technology, there’s no lighthouse kicking around from 2000 BC powered by a passive nuclear reactor for instance. 

Second you always have to wonder where they went. 

Now civilizations do often die out, but only kind of, they get replaced. 

Rome may have fallen, but the Roman Empire trucked on in the East for centuries and fell to another Empire when it did go down, and in the meantime Rome rapidly recovered and remained a political, cultural, and religious influence of the highest degree all the way up to today. 

When we say a civilization falls, we don’t mean its whole populace and influence disappeared. 

Usually it just divided up, moved its capital, dropped to second tier status, resurged later with modified territory and culture, that sort of thing. 

So where are these ancient aliens now? 

One possible answer, that they’ve ascended to a higher plane of existence as it were, we’ll look at in Category 4. 

Category 3C takes a different direction. 

It considers the possibility that the aliens are so alien that we just don’t even realize they exist, or exist as intelligent entities anyway, and possibly they have the same problem with us. 

The very alien is an interesting line of reasoning, and played with humorously in Terry Bisson’s short story “They’re made out of meat”. 

Giving serious examples of the ultra alien is obviously tricky, and that’s one of the weaknesses of this category. 

When we posit, for example, an intelligent tree, we can easily picture how we can’t see it or it us, as intelligent creatures. 

The problem is when we examine the notion of an intelligent tree we not only have to deal with how improbable an evolutionary development that is but also how we probably would be able to realize it was intelligent. 

If its mobile, either able to pick up and move or stays rooted but can swing its arms, we ought to notice that and would certainly notice physical structures inside the wood indicating that. 

If it isn’t, why would it evolve a brain? 

Brains are expensive after all, and start off as crude nervous systems to react and move. 

Evolution doesn’t encourage useless organs. 

The strength of 3C is that is simply isn’t disprovable, the weakness is that it’s pretty much impossible to usefully discuss. 

It’s one of those ‘how can we know for sure?’ or ‘anything is possible’ arguments that isn’t exactly wrong so much as just sort of futile to discuss as anything more than a thought experiment. 

Category 3D is our last one before getting into the miscellaneous material, and it raises the idea that we ourselves might be alien in origin. 

In this context I’m not talking about Panspermia in the sense of basic life originating in comets or the Oort Cloud and raining down on Early Earth, but the notion that intelligent life actually made humans, either directly or by starting life on Earth. 

Very popular notion in fiction, and a fun one, but it has some obvious problems. 

Like Ancient Astronauts you have to wonder where they went, and if we’re talking about just humans, then you have to wonder why our DNA is so like everything else’s. 

Sometimes the reasoning will be that we’re just an abandoned colony of a falling civilization that turned primitive, sometimes they just stopped by and gene-tweaked our ancestors to be smarter. 

As usual, there’s the whole lack of evidence thing, but the notion has some strengths, you could terraform a primitive world just by sneezing or emptying your septic tank on your space ship. 

Even our bacteria are quite sophisticated compared to primitive ones and would probably get the upper hand there and replace things. 

The specific weakness though is that it establishes that aliens are prone to expansion and capable of it, yet nobody is out doing it. 

Most Fermi Paradox solutions that don’t revolve around intelligent life being rare to begin with usually need to explain why aliens can’t or won’t expand and colonize all over the place, this one begins by saying they did. 

So what changed? 

Why did they stop and why hasn’t anyone picked up where they left off since? 

Summarizing Category 3 we see the big shared weakness is fundamentally the lack of evidence, and again the lack of evidence from the one place in the Universe we can most easily gather it. 

Theories revolving around evidence that is hard or impossible to get deserve a bit more credence then one’s that make it easy to get but still lacks it. 

Now for those of you still here and awake we get to move on to the Miscellaneous category. 

I promised myself I’d keep this video shorter than the original, especially with so many supplemental videos I could forward people onto for more detailed explanations thus letting me skim some topics, but even though I repeatedly and energetically trimmed material from the script I see that is going to be a broken promise. 

So here they are: Category 4A: The Zoo Hypothesis, Quarantine, and the Prime Directive They specifically hide from us or primitive cultures in general, for various reasons, as opposed to category 2D where they hide from everyone. 

Category 4B: Interdiction A variation on 4B, where civilizations agree not to expand or expand beyond a certain point. 

Category 4C: Self-Quarantine Species actively keep to themselves for fear of contagion Category 4D: Living Civilizations are very recent Living being the focus there, this is the category for cyclical extinction or a very recent galactic wide extinction. 

Category 4E: Ascension Aliens reach point where they just leave the mortal coil behind Category 4F: Civilizations reach Technological Singularity Civilizations convert totally to the post-biological state and end as super-advanced and super-powerful computers Category 4G: Rim Migration Civilizations eventually migrate to the colder outer areas of the galaxy Category 4H: Black Hole Farmers Like Rim Migration, a notion that has to do with concentrating your civilization where you can get the most bang for your buck. 

Those who have seen the original video will notice some changes and removals, there’s a couple add ons or modifications, and a couple removals because I didn’t feel they really had anything but humor value. 

There’s also three general themes in category 4, one being that civilizations move on, another that they have rules for dealing with each other that prevent contact, and the third being that they getting destroyed. 

We’ll save the first for last, because I feel like the concept of civilizations moving on is a nice way to end the video. 

Category 4A, generally known as the Zoo Hypothesis, is very like Quarantine and the Prime Directive in that it holds that alien civilizations have a motive for keeping us in particular or low-tech civilizations in general, in the darkabout their existence. 

Those motives can vary, for instance in Zoo Hypothesis that can be anything from not wanting to interfere in our natural development to using us for entertainment, or both, there’s no reason you can’t enjoy watching a primitive culture just because you want to keep it safe. 

Alternatively Quarantine holds that their motive is that want they to keep everyone safe from us. 

The Prime Directive variant is that they aren’t actively hiding they just refuse to show themselves until we reach a certain level of technological or cultural development. 

Now Zoo Hypothesis is a bit hard to dismiss when it holds to them faking us out with for instance a big TV-screen around our planet or solar system, but that’s much the same as the Simulation Hypothesis I mentioned way back in Category 1D and you can look at that notion in more detail that video. 

Specific to the Zoo Hypothesis though is the criticism that since we derive the entire Fermi Paradox in the first place from seeing how big the Universe is, if that image is fake it sorts of challenges the core concepts of science we derive the Paradox from. 

Quarantine, that they’re afraid of us, suffers from just not making much sense. 

Usually it means they’re afraid we’ll infect their culture with our violent ways, I’m not really sure how to argue that since it implies advanced civilizations are made up of a bunch of wimps with no moral backbone. 

I’m not afraid teaching kids about some of our nastier cultures that were into human sacrifice or genocide is going to turn them into ax crazy murderers, and I have problems thinking any advanced civilization, let alone all of them, would be afraid of inheriting our violent ways. 

Now the Prime Directive is a tricky one, mostly because people are very passionate about the subject. 

It’s dead on arrival normally from Exclusivity, we have no reason to think every civilization would think you shouldn’t talk to primitives, quite to the contrary, and we especially have no reason to think every member of every species would obey this, and it really only takes one person to break the silence. 

Category 4B: Interdiction The notion here is very like the last category in effect but different in motivation. 

Expansion isn’t rampant because species agree to large buffer zones, and they don’t talk to other low-tech races because they’ve agreed not to on the grounds that they don’t want their potential rivals or enemies poisoning the primitives’ minds about them, and they generally think conflict is best avoided by avoidance. 

Stay away from aliens, you can never entirely get them and its easier to get along with minimal contact. 

Everyone agree to keep themselves pretty small so nobody has a motive nor ability to go to war. 

This one doesn’t assume any particularly motivation besides caution, which doesn’t violate Exclusivity since we can assume that like curiosity caution is a trait probably shared by all technological civilizations. 

There’s also a good reason to enforce it, and it’s easier to enforce it with all that buffer space. 

Now it still got its problems, same as the others we just covered, but they aren’t as strong. 

You still have the issue of newly emerged spacefarers getting angry nobody gave them technology but the counterargument seems a little bit less smug maybe. 

We agreed to this treaty, its been around for a very long time, before us, and even if we didn’t think it was a good idea we do want to suffer the consequences of violating it. 

This rubs some folks the wrong way because they figure we ought to be able to talk to anyone, be friends with everyone, but Interdict doesn’t say you can’t chat a bit, just that its kept distant and minimal, and realistically getting along and tolerating other cultures is one of our culture ideals that isn’t too grounded in reality. 

We share common culture and biology, but still have a lot cultural traits and traditions that infuriate or disgust each other. 

And that’s not ne4cessarily wrong. 

I don’t want to go to war with a civilization that thinks you should deal with overpopulation by killing off anyone who doesn’t get on the honor roll as a kid, and a lot of aliens that give birth to litters might have developed that habit and kept to it long before some form of birth control was invented. 

I don’t really want to be good friends with them either, and it’s much easier to stay away from conflict by just staying far away. 

I don’t think Interdiction stands up to scrutiny but I think its on stronger footing than the Zoo Hypothesis notion or Quarantine. 

Now Category 4C is Self-Quarantine. 

This is where you isolate yourself, and it’s like 2D, hiding, except you’re not actually hiding. 

You keep to yourself, warn others to stay away, and don’t permit much outward expansion of your own civilization because you don’t want mutant strains of your civilization popping up as possible threats. 

I talked in the Dyson Dilemma about all the problems trying to keep your own people from spreading out but it is fundamentally doable. 

Spaceships by and large are not small or subtle, it would tend to be pretty obvious when someone was building one and very obvious when they start flying off. 

The Weakness here is the obvious one, Exclusivity. 

We’ve no reason to think every civilization would act like this. 

But it also has another problem. 

If you want to keep to yourself this doesn’t mean you’re super-quiet. 

If I want people to stay away from me I leave No Trespassing signs around, animals mark their territory too. 

So you’d expect big beacons saying ‘Hi, stay away from our stuff, we’re not hostile but we like our privacy and are armed to the teeth, for urgent or vital diplomatic matters please contact us at 867-5309.’ Total silence isn’t a great idea if you want to be left alone, because people will blunder in unknowingly or out of curiosity, and if you blow them up you haven’t got much moral ground to stand on when your neighboring civilizations find out you’ve killed their citizens. 

If you want to be left alone, it pays to very loud about telling others that, not the other way around. 

4D is the notion that civilizations just popped up recently, and not in the ‘life has only been possible for the last billion years’ way. 

Usually this implies either coincidentally a major calamity or war just happened and we missed it, or someone comes by killing civilizations every so often. 

Popular idea in fiction, they used in the TV show Babylon 5, and they used it in the video game series Mass Effect, and plenty of others. 

Unfortunately coming up with a motive for why this is done never makes much sense, ask a lot of Mass Effect fans how they feel about the end of the third game for an example. 

Great for fiction, the idea of an ancient evil predator periodically arising to consume us appeals to our natural fear of predators. 

Bad for science. 

If you just want to wipe out every single life form in the galaxy, you can get it done a lot easier and keep it done. 

That implies someone is harvesting or culling folks. 

They obviously aren’t literally eating us or enslaving us, and if they just want our culture or memories that can be obtained without genocide. 

The other issue is that the Universe doesn’t stop at the edge of our galaxy. 

If ours had these, well let’s just call them Reapers, show up first on the scene, they are obviously not a true K3 civilization. 

So a galaxy where a K3 did pop up could come blasting in here and smear the galaxy with them. 

And while we tend to think of the gulf between galaxies as vast and empty, galaxies are very close to each other relatively speaking, more like continents then tiny little islands separated by thousands of miles of ocean like solar systems are. 

There’s tons of stars between galaxies, possibly more than in galaxies, and while they are spread out and probably don’t have a lot rocky planets, they still make an easy bridgehead between galaxies even if you don’t have faster than light technology. 

So at that point you hit Exclusivity, because you wouldn’t expect every galaxy to develop these Reapers with their bizarre and seemingly illogical motives. 

Category 4E, Ascension, is the first of what I think of as the sort of Eschatological solutions. 

A staple of science fiction is that we eventually evolve into beings of pure energy or ascend to higher planes of existence. 

From a Fermi Paradox solution standpoint this actually works just fine so long as it is happening to every race and all its members and before they spread out much. 

That’s the strength of the next category actually, which looks at it more from a technological perspective. 

Now ascension has two big problems. 

First, we have no idea if such a thing is possible, it basically requires tossing all known science out the window, and honestly it always smack was too much of New Age religion to me. 

Which if that’s your thing, hey, great, but this also only works as a Fermi Paradox solution if they divorce themselves from the Universe, which also always seems weird to me. 

I mean from a fiction standpoint you kinda have to have them do that, stories don’t work well when demigods hang around constantly able to fix all problems with a snap of their fingers, but fiction isn’t science and that’s why. 

Writers, even excluding their own biases or lack of expertise on a givensubject, have to create a story that is interesting, we don’t care if it sacrifices some realism to achieve that. 

But good stories don’t make for good science just because they’re thoughtful or fascinating tales. 

Second we can’t be sure they’d all do it, and in fact you’d expect they wouldn’t. 

The Amish are one of many groups that generally speaking aren’t too sanguine on technology, and I doubt that will change overall down the centuries. 

I can’t see us ever pointing guns at our splinter cultures that reject the main culture or technology and forcing them to convert, and you’d actually expect a lot of these to be among the first to head out to colonize other stars. 

So civilizations prone to ascension might just have a constant expanding wave of those rejecting it and those accepting it. 

Same problem with Category 4F, Technological singularities, but these frequently are envisioned as occurring very near term, not distant future. 

We’ll examining the concept in the Transhumanism and Immortality video but the strength is that its not requiring any break with known physics, it’s basically the idea of replacing your civilization with technological supermen or one super-massive mega-computer. 

As we discussed in the Dyson Dilemma, so long as it keeps a desire to survive and needs resources present in this Universe to do it, this whole category is basically irrelevant to the Fermi Paradox. 

Doesn’t matter if supermen replace us, anymore than us replacing Neanderthals, as far as the Fermi Paradox is concerned except that they ought to be way better at expanding if they want to, and again as we discussed in the companion video, they probably would. 

We also addressed the notion of people hiding in virtual realities or digital existences there and will look at that more in the Simulation Hypothesis and Transhumanism videos Category 4G: Rim Migration, is actually an extension on technological singularities. 

Once you’ve gone post-biological and basically run on energy and data it helps to be somewhere that is cold. 

There’s an absolute minimum energy needed to erase a digit, to perform the most basic calculation, and it depends on the Temperature. 

Space isn’t actually very cold, that’s a source of confusion for a lot of people, but the depths of interstellar space are a lot colder than wherever you’re sitting right now. 

Yet it still isn’t as cold as intergalactic space. 

The coldest anywhere right now is 2.7 Kelvin, about a hundredth of the temperature water freezes at, because space is constantly saturated by the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. 

Can’t get away from it. 

But inside a galaxy it’s a lot hotter because there’s all that ambient light and dust and so on keeping it a bit warmer. 

So we often figure giant computer minds move themselves out to the galactic rim where they can get plenty of hydrogen still to fuel themselves but can run more efficiently. 

The flaw is the obvious one, even if everyone does this long before going interstellar, becomes a huge computer I mean, group sharing the computer or single overmind, you still have to make the trip. 

Now you can move a whole star, we talk about that in the Megastructure video Shkadov Thrusters, but that’s not a quiet process, and your thrust is pointing in toward the galaxy so you’re quite visible. 

You’d also wonder why they are bothering while there’s still a galaxy to harvest. 

I mean sure, efficiency is great but which is better, one star you get maximum efficiency off of, once you spend all the time and energy moving it out to the rim or getting out there and using one already there, or several billion stars each of which you get maybe half the computation off of. 

All much closer to hand too. 

Category 4H: Black Hole Farmers, wow, last category, okay, here we go. 

We’ve talked before about using black holes as power sources but we meant small artificial ones. 

This time we mean big ones, and its less of a Fermi Paradox solution then a sort of final scenario for when all the stars burn out. 

This is sort of an extension off Rim Migration in that it revolves around getting the most computation you can off single drop of energy. 

Not just computation either, thermodynamics always involves getting your most efficiency when you’re moving from hottest to coldest. 

We talked in that video about how Black Holes are thought to slowly evaporate by Hawking Radiation, those we small black holes though, ones vastly smaller than any we expect to exist. 

Naturally occurring ones are far too massive to evaporate right now, they gain mass simply by absorbing Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation since they emit less Hawking Radiation then they absorb by that. 

Only black holes with a total mass less than our moon actually radiate more energy then they take in from the CMBR, and those are several million times less massive then naturally occurring black holes. 

One day, a long long long time from now when all the stars have burned out the Universe will have cooled down enough that those big natural black holes will emit more energy than they take in, and that will probably be the final and longest phase of life in this universe. 

Civilizations will huddle around these black holes slowly drinking in the energy, which is very small but super efficient, creeping along very slowly but for a total duration that would regard the entire history of our universe like an eyeblink. 

And if you’re digital, and you run on computer power, who cares how long passes in real time for you to have a conversation? 

Only your subjective time matters. 

These sorts of black hole are very easy to find or make, and it would not be strange for civilizations to stockpile resources by dumping hydrogen right into black holes, you could use the gravity pulling them in to power your civilization pretty well too. 

Now why this doesn’t make a great Fermi Paradox solution is that it should be pretty obvious someone is doing it, and even though you’re planning for the ultra long term patience is not a virtue here. 

Every second suns burn on is energy wasted for you, never to be recovered, its also whole galaxies drifting away far beyond where you’ll ever be able to reach them to harvest. 

But I get asked a lot where I think civilization will eventually go and I tend to figure its probably this. 

Eventually you can’t live on sunlight anymore and you farm black holes instead. 

It seems like a real dark and cold existence but in reality it would probably be incredibly vibrant. 

We talk about that more down the road once we’ve looked at some other subjects. 

These kind of final civilizations can keep existing for truly immense stretches of time, but of course nothing lasts for ever and everything eventually comes to an end. 

And on that note I think that’s where we’ll wrap up for now.

Megastructures 08: Shkadov Thrusters
---
  
2016-04-22

So this week we will be taking a quick look at the Shkadov Thruster, one of simplest types of Dyson Swarm to make, and a system for both moving things around the solar system and moving entire solar systems. 

This will be one of the shortest videos on the channel, which both ironically and non-coincidentally will be followed next week by the longest video to date on the channel. 

I’ll talk about that a bit more at the end in a quick channel update. 

Here in the megastructures series we’ll be looking at Dyson Spheres for a while, and there’s a reason why I don’t really consider them a megastructure in of themselves, even though today’s example could actually be built as one single rigid structure. 

As I mentioned in the Dyson Dilemma, the notion of any Dyson Sphere as a rigid body has always been at odds with the original concept, which is a swarm of bodies orbiting the sun. 

These could very from quite tiny individually, smaller than even modern satellites, to enormous structures, all with varying purpose, and to me a Dyson swarm is a megastructure the same way a metropolis is a building. 

Though you could build a single large city-sized building, often called an Arcology, something we’ll probably look at down the road. 

I tend to regard even a minimal early dyson, basically one where you’ve hollowed out the asteroids in the asteroid belt to build solar collectors around the sun, and rotating habitats in those asteroids, as a Dyson. 

You don’t mine asteroids for planetary consumption, except maybe of very rare and precious metals as a small but lucrative side business. 

You mine them to build other space-based industry. 

And a lot of times that will be very thin power collectors, either direct solar panels or mirrors. 

This gets us to our Shkadov Thruster because one of the most obvious applications of all those mirrors and panels is that light can be concentrated to produce thrust on objects like spaceships. 

Either direct thrust by pressure or by heating up gas inside them that gets expelled as rocket thrust. 

I’ve talked before about the concept of statites, ultra thin satellites that can remain static in their location rather than orbiting, held up by radiation pressure, and this is a major portion of the Shkadov Thruster because this notion of moving solar systems is usually comes up for moving your own, especially to avoid hazard areas of the galaxy like near a potential Supernova, but as we’ll see in a bit the better method is actually moving those giant stars that can go supernova. 

Now a Shkadov Thruster itself is a really simple concept. 

Stars emit energy, both solar wind and light, but they do it omnidirectionally so they don’t move. 

If just one hemisphere of the star was lit up, it would begin to accelerate in the opposite direction. 

This is worth remembering for more than the Shkadov thruster because every object in space radiates energy, waste heat, and if you make it emit more in one direction then another it will get thrust from that. 

Meaning a lot of our megastructures can be made into very slow spaceships simply by slightly altering their geometry so they emit more light in one direction continuously. 

Photons, the particle of light, are nothing but momentum, they have no mass So if an object is emitting asymmetrically it will begin to have a net force on it equal to the emitted power divided by the speed of light. 

Or an acceleration equal to the emitted power divided by the mass of object and the speed of light. 

If we want to move a one kilogram of object at one gee, normal Earth gravity, we can emit from that object, or let it absorb, 2.94 Megawatts. 

Now since we usually think of most space stations as being about room temperature, 300K, they’d emit about 460 Watts per square meter of exterior and probably weigh at least a ton per square meter, making for an acceleration of less than a billionth of a gee even if you can get it to be mostly asymmetric, making it a crummy acceleration method but possibly enough for station-keeping, where you just need minor nudges. 

But you can get twice the thrust by using a mirror instead. 

A photon hitting and absorbing into something only gives you that one push, if it reflects off it doubles that push, since it moves away with the opposite momentum it hit with, meaning mirrors let you get twice the bang for your buck, or watt, and gives you 1.47 megawatts per kilogram of object as your 1 gee power need. 

That’s what makes laser sails more attractive, you can hit something with a mirror on the back with concentrated light at a distance and give it a big boost to speed. 

And a real big boost to speed when you consider that the sun puts out 3.8x10^26 Watts of power, which means you could accelerate an object massing 1.3x10^18 kilograms, or 1.3 billion megatons, at one gee constantly. 

And just one megaton makes for a very large ship. 

Alternatively, mirrors bouncing that sunlight can be quite small, tin foil thicknesses or less, quite possibly a lot less since some materials like graphene might only need to be a few atoms thick to make a nice mirror, and it could be very close to the sun without melting especially since its reflecting most of that light, not absorbing it, so you could get away with placing these mirrors where the sun is a lot brighter per square meter of reflecting material, and use less mirrors. 

A few tons of cheap mirrors could easily provide the light to accelerate a few tons of spaceship. 

And those spaceships don’t have to move directly away from the mirror or sun, they can bounce that light to move at angles. 

You can also place mirrors farther out in the solar system on or gravitationally anchored to heavy objects like planets and reflect light off them and back into the system to let ships move toward the sun, not just away from it. 

So we get our first motivation for a simple early dyson, mirrors are cheap, especially super-thin mirrors in space. 

You could make whole planet sized ones out of a very small asteroid, and they’re nothing but cheap thin material with a tiny computer and a bit of mechanism to let you twist or distort the mirror. 

And if they’re thin enough we don’t even need to put them into an orbit, they can just hover right over the star like a piece of paper over an air vent, using the light and the solar wind to stay afloat. 

That’s the concept of a statite, a static satellite, which I’ve discussed before. 

And the interesting thing about these is that their thickness doesn’t depend on how far away they are from a star, since gravity, as well as light and solar wind, all fall off inverse-square of distance, the same statite can hover in by Mercury or out by Jupiter. 

This thickness, linear density, of a statite, varies by star, not distance, since bigger stars put out way more light and solar wind then smaller ones and it rises a lot faster than gravity does. 

A star 10 times as massive as our own puts out ten times the gravity but several thousand times the light for instance, letting you have a statite several hundred times heavier per unit area. 

You can also link statites together physically since they don’t orbit, I render it graphically this way, because its easier, though you probably would never build a truly rigid sun-encompassing shell. 

You could though, so ironically the easiest Dyson to build, one of these thin sheet statites, can be made as a rigid shell, whereas normally we consider that impossible for more substantial Dyson Spheres. 

This doesn’t take much mass either, even the smallest planet is more than sufficient and it is unlikely there are many stars that don’t have enough rocky material floating around them for this. 

Now the Shkadov Thruster is the obvious if extreme application, we build a hemisphere instead of a sphere around a sun and let the light bounce off it, pushing the sun. 

The mirrors stay in place because gravity holds them there. 

You could also do this with an orbiting swarm, by having those mirrors perpendicular to the light on one side of the sun, and twist parallel to the light when they are in the direction you want to leave open so the light passes by them unreflected This approach has some advantages in letting you build more robust objects and better aim your light too, and you also have a hybrid stage, object that are still thin enough to get significant push from light but too thick to be held up by it, which can have abnormally slow orbits for their distance from the sun, a concept not unlike Lagrange points, which can be very handy if you’ve got solar collectors you want to keep in line with Earth. 

Lagrange points work by causing a slightly faster or slower orbit around a primary body by the slight decrease or increase in gravity from a second body, and this is a similar concept, though by using light instead of secondary gravity, I don’t think this object has a name yet so I will tentatively coin the term ‘lagites’ as hat tip to lagrange points and lagging orbital periods. 

I also haven’t seen any papers on the matter giving it a serious detailed treatment so that’s probably fair game for any grad students or postdocs looking for a nice paper to knock out. 

Getting back to Shkadov Thrusters, they’re a fairly simple concept, but we have to ask ourselves why you’d build one. 

Because they’re slow. 

You won’t be able to reflect all that light so using our straight non bounce method probably gives us our best quick approximation and the sun emits 3.8x10^26 Watts but it also masses 2x10^30 kilograms. 

So pumping that into our equation gives us… ouch, 6.3x10^-13 m/s2. 

Okay, but stars live a long time, and a year is over 30 million seconds, so our delta-v in a year is… oh crumbs, 20 millionths of a meter per second, okay so it will take 50,000 years to get up to a meter a second, walking speed. 

But in 50 million years that would be a kilometer per second and that is actually a lot at the galactic scale, since those are the kind of timelines and speeds that will let you dodge stuff. 

Aim your star like you were trying to break orbit from the galaxy and you could sail off eventually, though we orbit the galactic core at about 200 km/s. 

And that would be 10 billion years of thrust to get to those kind of delta-v’s. 

Putting that in terms of distance, off from where you would have been otherwise, a million years will get you only about .036 light years away, or 13 light days, but that’s enough to avoid dangerous approaches to other solar systems, and in 10 million years that would be 3.6 light years, and in a hundred million years, 360 light years, and in a billion years, 36,000 light years, enough to be anywhere in the galaxy you want, with a full ten billion year solar life time letting you cover 3.6 million light years and trucking along at about a thousandth the speed of light. 

Honestly not a great spaceship, but other stars live longer right? 

Well, yes but the problem is the longer lived ones also put out way less power. 

A star half our sun’s mass accelerates twice as fast from the same force, but it only puts out about 4% the power of our sun does so it will accelerate even slower, 8% as fast. 

But they do live a lot longer, so for instance our neighbor, Barnard’s star, would only accelerate at 2.4% the speed our sun would, but it also ought to live a couple trillions years, so it might only accelerate at a fortieth the speed but it gets to do it about 250 times longer and end with about 6 times the velocity. 

But the other direction, more massive, works out pretty well. 

An O or B-type Giant Star, a potential supernova candidate, let’s say good old Spica 250 light years away, outmasses our sun by a factor of ten, meaning it needs ten times the power for the same thrust, but it’s also emits about 12,000 times as much power as our sun. 

So it can pull off 1200 times the acceleration. 

These kinds of stars often live only a few million years, but after a million years as a Shkadov Thruster you could have moved it 1200 times as far too, 43 light years, 172 light years in 2 million years, more than enough to get it out of your neighborhood, and Spica is only a B-type star, not a Big O-type. 

You can shove those away much faster, especially since you can also bounce your solar wind out not just your light, giving you more thrust. 

But here’s the key concept, if you’re afraid a supernova is going to hit your civilization in a million years, it’s actually easier to move that star, not your own, especially since you’d have to move all the solar systems you colonized too, and there are thousands of normal stars you’d want to colonize for every supernova candidate in a given volume it would threaten. 

Now you might be thinking you’d want to direct that supernova candidate somewhere close but not too close so you could harvest the metals it will make when it explodes, after all, a real Dyson one thick with rotating habitats, not just a thin shell Shkadov Thruster, takes a lot more metal than most solar systems have lying around, but honestly it wouldn’t likely be worth it, especially since one of the things you can do with all that energy from your swarm of thin solar collectors is some serious alchemy. 

I mentioned in the Dyson Dilemma video that while fusion of lighter elements into heavy ones is a nice way to gain power, but still currently beyond us even for the simplest hydrogen to helium transmutation, if you don’t mind losing power in the process you can make heavier elements much easier. 

And you would, after all, have a lot of power lying around to run your supercolliders. 

We’ll examine that more as we continue our look at Dyson spheres in future videos, but we’ll stop here for today. 

The Shkadov Thruster for moving stars, and its simpler version, simple thin solar collectors for sucking up energy or propelling spaceships around or out of your solar system, is where solar englobement begins. 

Next week it is back to the Fermi Paradox to revisit the basics in what I’m dubbing the Fermi Paradox Compendium as opposed to just Solutions 2.0. 

That was supposed to be ready this week, but then it is a remake of the previous record holder for longest video and I thought it would be shorter, unfortunately there was a lot of material I wanted to cover so it’s got a runtime of 70 minutes and only about a third of the video is done, which as these things go would make it about 70% complete, usually researching, preparing, writing, and recording the script take about half the time or less to make these videos, but that still meant doing this video was faster than finishing that one. 

I’m still deciding if I want to keep to a weekly release schedule, intermixing shorter and longer videos, or just fall back to an every other week schedule. 

We also have a poll this week for which of the selected topics you want me to hit next, the queue is very full of topics but I’d appreciate knowing which you’d prefer I cover first. 

As always, questions and comments are welcome, if you’re new to this channel you can try out some of the other videos, and if you enjoyed the video, don’t forget to like and share it.

Double Planets and Rocheworlds
---
  
2016-04-15  
https://youtu.be/lgkqbHJczWs  

---

So today we’re looking at Double Planets, and our big focus is going to be on the especially rare case of two Earth Sized planets orbiting every 24 hours, since that’s the probably the most interesting case, to us anyway. 

But we’ll also take a look at a few other examples to including Rocheworlds, double planets that have literally merged into a dumbbell shape, and as always we’ll take some time to discuss how native life might arise on such worlds and what special aspects of terraforming would be needed to make these habitable for humans. 

The first thing to understand about double planets is that there’s no real cutoff at which something ceases being a moon and becomes a double planet. 

Our own moon, at an eightieth Earth’s Mass and a 1000 miles in radius is enormous as natural satellites go, one of the largest in the solar system and all the others of similar size are around gas giants much bigger than Earth. 

Yet an Earth-sized moon around a Jupiter-sized gas giant, our topic a couple videos back, would be much more like what we mean by planet yet would be proportionally much smaller compared to that gas giant than the moon is to us. 

Pluto and Charon are the closest to being double planets, and will actually be my own cut off point. 

Charon is about an eight Pluto’s mass, not the eightieth the Moon is to Earth. 

Some would argue having the barycenter of a two-body system outside of the larger planet is the proper definition, which is not true for Earth and the Moon but is true for Pluto and Charon, but that’s also not my definition for today. 

I will be arguing that it is because they are both tidally locked to each other that makes for two double planets, in the context of what we think of as a habitable planet, which is what this series is about. 

Now we discussed tidal locking in detail on the video about that and before in this series as well, but as a quick reminder, that is when a moon or planets slows its rotation over time from tidal forces until it has the same side always pointing at its larger neighbor. 

In a double lock, both planets point the same face at each other, and realistically any two planets of vaguely Earth mass and temperature will be close enough in their orbit of each other that they will have both tidally locked long before complex life could arisen, though in point of fact the sheer tidal stresses involved prior to that double lock would probably prevent complex life arising before that lock anyway. 

What we haven’t discussed before is a barycenter, and mostly because it usually doesn’t matter. 

We do not exactly orbit the sun, nor the moon orbit us, in terms of circling around it. 

For any two-body system there is a center of mass that two actually orbit, and this moves since two body systems usually have at least slightly elliptical orbits. 

We’re mostly interested in circular or very low eccentricity orbit today though. 

Now if the main body is infinitely bigger then the satellite that barycenter would be exactly in the middle, but of course that’s never the case and for the Earth-moon that barycenter is in Earth’s Mantle, whereas for Pluto and Charon it’s actually outside Pluto. 

And it will be in pretty much any case we’d start thinking of a planet and moon as a double planet instead. 

As the planets get closer and closer in mass, if you’re looking at them from above that barycenter, they increasingly stop looking like one is orbiting the other and more and more look like both are orbiting the barycenter, until at equal mass they seem to both orbit on the same circle 180 degrees apart. 

And if they are both tidally locked then the same face of each will always point at the other. 

This is great for space elevator if you’ve got a material strong enough because you can run one right from the one to the other. 

If they’re on elliptical orbits you’d need to have winches on either end playing out or reeling in a little extra length since they would alter their total distance a bit. 

Though you could, hypothetically anyway, use such a tether, if it’s just a little stronger than it needs to be to avoid snapping, to slowly force the two into a perfectly circular orbit. 

Or one just as close to that as you like so as to keep some tidal forces in play, which we’ll get back to in a minute. 

Now in the case of two planets with approximately the same mass as Earth, the one most people are interested in, once they’ve gotten tidally locked, in order for them to have a day 24 hours long they’d need to be just over 33,000 miles, or 53,000 km from center to center for a circular orbit, only one seventh of the distance from center to center of the Earth and Moon. 

Different masses or day lengths would have different distances but you may calculate such cases if you’re curious and in the video description below there is a link to a convenient online calculator for that. 

Further away and the days are longer, closer together and the days are shorter and we get even more severe tides. 

Now that’s actually only 25,000 miles apart, since 33,000 was from center to center, and these are 4000 mile radius planets. 

That’s more than nine time closer than the moon is and the planet is just under 4 times wider, so the other planet is going to be about 40 times wider in the sky. 

Here we’ve got our moon coming over the horizon, and here would be that double planet. 

And a double planet could also have a moon, orbiting out far beyond the two, and it will more or less look and act like a normal moon of that appropriate size and distance around a planet of double the normal mass. 

Of course that double planet never rises or sets, it stays in the same place in the sky minus minor perturbations and libration like we discussed back in episode 2 in regard to tidal locking. 

It’s also going to be incredibly bright, over a thousand times as bright as the moon. 

One side of the planet always has it hanging overhead, and the other never sees it, with a band around the middle where it wobbles up and down over the horizon. 

Now before they became mutually tidally locked the tides on these planets would be monstrous, but would settle down to very low once that happened, relatively speaking anyway. 

Two mutually locked bodies still exert tidal force on each other but it’s from various types of libration and orbital eccentricity, not perfectly circular orbits and the like. 

A very mildly eccentric orbit that saw the two planets just 5% further apart than when they were closest would mean the gravity between them was 9.3% lower then when they were closest, so the distortion caused by that 24-hour 9.3% drop in force pulling each other would get you pretty decent tides, considering that change in force is a good deal stronger than the total force the moon exerts on the Earth. 

The moon is only 1.2% of the Earth’s mass, so even a twin planet that far away would exert about 80 times the force that the Moon does, and ours are seven times closer. 

The total force exerted would be around 4000 times what the moon exerts on us. 

So the change in force from the moon being on one side, then another, of the Earth, when compared to a 9.3% variation in force from a planet being 5% closer at perigee than apogee, is a good 200 hundred fold higher. 

Even if that apogee and perigee ratio was 100:101 we’d still be looking at 40 times the force variation. 

That’s vastly smaller then what would have been experienced by both before they tidally locked but still pretty darn impressive. 

For Earth like tides you’d need an eccentricity that kept them from moving more than about a hundred miles closer or further apart. 

That is one reason why a space elevator between them, either the classic one built on tensile strength like we discussed in the first episode of the megastructures series or the alternative pushing form, the space fountain we discussed in episode 3 of that series, would be very nice for terraforming. 

Besides the obvious value of a space elevator for getting material on and off those planets when terraforming them, and traveling between them, you could use that elevator to slowly bring down the eccentricity to the desired level, which might be preferable to some of the other methods we discussed in the Terraforming video for tinkering with planetary orbits and rotational speeds. 

Now a common question about double planets is if they could share an atmosphere, and the answer is yes but it depends. 

The Rocheworld case will get to in a couple minutes can, but actual double planets like our Dual Earth case really cannot. 

These two planets will actually deform slightly toward each other, making them even a bit closer from surface to surface then I previously mentioned, and there would be exchange of material during major asteroid strikes, possibly allowing one world to seed another with life. 

Especially early on in a solar systems life when you’d expect a lot more debris to be careening around impacting stuff, a strike could send very basic and robust microbes up into orbit and to fall back down on the other world. 

We’d be talking very tiny and robust things though, so you wouldn’t expect them to have the same flora and fauna, just to quite probably use the same basic building blocks. 

And while atmosphere arguably extend hundreds of miles over a planet, what we think of when we mean atmosphere is where you can still breath and fly, and that could never stretch over that distance. 

There’s no special tricks to terraforming these planets, they are in this specific case obviously very earth like in mass and temperature, so just that linking space elevator trick is unique to them and you can actually do something similar with any two bodies, tidally locked or not, so long as you let the base of the elevator move on some track, though an Earth-Moon one for instance would require a lot of extra energy to overcome the constant massive drag of slamming the base through your own atmosphere at supersonic speeds, making this a trick much better done from a top an orbital ring like we also discussed back in the first megastructures video, since there’s no air up there to cause drag and sonic booms. 

Regarding life on such a double planet, they’d be forming in a very high tide environment, which is not necessarily a concern, Earth used to have way worse tides back when the moon first formed and it was closer and the earth spun around about once every 12 hours not 24. 

Only a double planet with any eccentricity is going to keep pretty impressive tides so possibly amphibians would be a larger share of the planet’s animal life. 

More tides also means erosion too, and this would effect storms, but if you’re just thinking of this from a fictional standpoint, or one we’ve terraformed including altering the orbital eccentricity, then it could be tailored to ape Earth tides by simply having low eccentricity. 

No flying critters between planets though, for that you need a Rocheworld. 

The Roche limit is as close as an object holding itself together by gravity can get to another large body before being shredded, as the larger body pulls on the surface of the smaller one harder than the smaller one pulls on that surface itself. 

This gets worse from both the deformation from gravity and the centrifugal spin near the surface. 

Equal sized, or near equal sized, bodies have much lower Roche Limits, so close they practically have to be touching. 

Even our moon if brought close to Earth would have to be within 6000 miles, which would be skimming distance since the Earth is 4000 miles in radius and the moon 1000 so they’d only have a 1000 miles of separation from closest points. 

For our double planet the two can flat out overlap, and Robert L. Forward played with this idea in his novel Rocheworld. 

Your two planets are more egg shaped then Spheres, and can definitely share atmospheres. 

They are also definitely tidally locked. 

They can share an atmosphere, they can even share an ocean, and eventually they will deform to share land and become a peanut shape. 

This can take billions of years, but once that occurs they will begin merging into a single sphere and that will be a very destructive process if you’re living on it. 

But it is a geological timeline, not a short one. 

This is also the sort of process that could give birth to a naturally occurring Hoopworld, we looked at the artificial variety recently in the megastructures series. 

While very close double planets should eventually merge together, if this process was interrupted by a strike from a large rogue planetoid, similar to how our own Moon is thought to have formed, and a strike that added a lot of new angular momentum to the system, it could result in a torus shaped planet. 

Neither a Rocheworld nor a Torus world are terribly probable or stable items, double planets, even the big double pair of Earth masses, aren’t incredibly likely either but would be much more likely than either of those. 

Now a Rocheworld has another problem, the ones with Earth-like gravity would have very short days. 

These are double planets whose centers, if we’re talking Earth-like masses, will be only about 10,000 miles from center to center. 

So your day length is only 4 hours long. 

I don’t think there’s any combination of worlds that would give you fairly Earth like gravity and day length that wasn’t almost completely water. 

What we often dub a Panthalassic world. 

Water deforms, as a fluid, much easier than rigid bodies so you could have a rocheworld that had a lot of water, and a vaguely sane day length and surface gravity, which might actually connect oceans and potentially if just right have land masses on the far sides of the two planets. 

We’ll talk more about Panthalassic worlds in the future, ones who outside this case are worlds with no land mass, or very little land mass, not including icebergs, potentially whole ice continents, and oceans many miles deep. 

But that’s going to wrap us up for double planets today, next week we’ll be returning to the Fermi Paradox for a new, updated, and expanded version of Comprehensive list of Fermi Paradox Solutions, so we can lay the groundwork to start exploring some of those solutions in greater individual depth in their stand alone videos.

Megastructures 07: Hoopworlds
---
  
2016-04-08  
https://youtu.be/yrsPHPYX0TI  

---

So we return today to the Megastructures series, a bit unexpectedly, for a look at Hoopworlds. 

Hypothetical megastructures that are shaped like donuts or hoops. 

Donut Planet seems insufficiently dignified, so the term Hoopworld has stuck. 

I’ve heard them called Toroidal worlds too but that’s not entirely accurate. 

A Toroid is any object created by taking a surface and revolving it around a circle so you end up with this sort of ring shape. 

A Torus is where that’s a circle and even it has some non-obvious versions. 

A torus has two types of radius. 

The Major Radius, which is what you rotated around to get the shape, and a minor radius, which the radius of this circle inscribing the Torus. 

That can have some unexpected versions, like the Spindle Torus, where the major radius is smaller than the minor radius, more of an apple shape, and would be a sphere if the major radius was 0. 

And a Horn Torus, which is when the major and minor radius are equal. 

Our interest is in the Ring Torus, and specifically where the major radius is not just larger than the minor radius but much larger, and Hoop fits that idea just fine. 

Now it is actually possible, highly improbable but still possible, for a planet shaped like this to naturally occur, either beginning as a double planet, our subject for next week in the Habitable Planet Series, or as a very fast rotating ellipsoid planet that disintegrates into a hoop. 

Take that Spindle Torus for instance, that’s already very close to what a very fast spin planet might look like. 

I’ve seen some interesting discussions of such world forming naturally but this is the Megastructures series so Nature can go jump off a skyscraper, which also aren’t naturally occurring. 

If you’ve already seen the Shell Worlds and Discworlds video then you’re familiar with the concept of Active Supports Structures like Orbital rings, and you can make a Hoopworld using those same basic principles. 

Using orbiting mass that is spinning quite quickly to provide our inertia to keep things from falling together while magnetically levitating a non-spinning stationary layer above it we can build our fake planet on, which I will call the Sheath. 

Now if you’ve just entered this video without seeing prior ones, the megatructures series is not really a self-contained one, we reference a lot of prior concepts, especially in this episode so you might want to go back and watch those first. 

In some ways it’s actually easier because your sheath for a hoopworld is already pretty close to stable. 

A hoopworld isn’t really a stable natural planet design but its pretty close so our artificial version only needs a little extra effort to make sure it stays stable. 

You’re essentially building a big ring whose centrifugal force of orbit is cancelling out the gravity that wants to collapse back together again. 

This is no different than a planetary ring like Saturn has, only denser and much more massive. 

Usually about a dozen times more so than Earth, in terms of both mass and living area. 

Planetary Rings, especially big ones like Saturn’s, aren’t terribly stable on astronomical timelines as collisions and perturbations from gravity tend to slowly deplete the ring. 

Saturn hasn’t always had such a big one and won’t always have it. 

Earth has probably had one several times, probably a much thicker one then Saturn before some of it coalesced into the Moon and the rest fell back down to earth or got flung off out of our gravity well. 

In many respects a hoopworld is simply ones of these, only made solid and stabilized. 

In fact this would be a pretty good approach to terraform Neptune or Uranus mass gas giant, using their rocky metallic cores as your exterior sheath and the gaseous part as your filler material, generating gravity to hold people to the sheath while simultaneously keeping that sheath from collapsing. 

This would also, if you configured it with this in mind, generate one heck of a magnetic field to protect the world from a lot of the nastier types of radiation and keep the atmosphere on there. 

As we discussed back in the Terraforming video, if you want a place to be livable in the long term you need to either have a strong magnetic field generated by it, create an artificial one around it, or not have an exposed atmosphere, like rotating habitats where everything is sealed inside. 

A hoopworld with a molten core or high speed filler material would have a very impressive magnetic field more than capable of withstanding more volatile suns and the least hospitable regions of the galaxy. 

So while Hoopworlds at first seem even more ostentatious and impractical then Discworlds, let alone Spherical Shellworlds, there’s quite a few circumstances where these would have massive advantages. 

Also like the Shellworld, but unlike the Discworld, it not only has seasons if tipped on its axis toward the sun but also has tropical, temperate, and cold regions. 

Also right down the middle you can have an object bobbing up and down, though it’s periods more closely resemble those of a moon then a sun, like the Alderson Disc this is not a great setup spot for a fake sun to light the place, the ‘day length’ it would take to bob up, down, and back again is too long if it needs to get up high enough to provide any light to the outer area of the hoop. 

Just fine for a moon though, although it would need stabilization especially if the hoop were tilted on its axis to the sun, which it needs to be or you’d have no light to the inner sections. 

But it would let you have a moon and tides. 

Interestingly, the maps used in a lot of old video games, where if you went too far east or west, north or south, and just emerged on the other side, at the same position, actually corresponds to a torus shape. 

If you played a lot of those old Nintendo RPGs you’d probably remember that but what’s always amused me is some of them hade an extra Underworld below, and while you can have those on a Shell World, there up is your up, they not flipped upside down like in Hollow Earth models. 

The cool thing about a hoopworld is you can actually do that flipped over version, using a long interior rotating habitat, sort of miniature version of the Topopolis we discussed near the end of that video. 

Connecting the two is pretty easy, you just make sure the connecting shafts let you build up speed, so that at the bottom of it you’ve matched speeds with the rotating section, then climb up through any airlock mechanism in what would be its floor. 

Of course you’d have too artificial light this underworld, but tis double your land space. 

Also just like the shell world, if you’re doing artificial lighting you can do additional nested layers for your hoop. 

And if you’re using lots of active support structures anyway, you can make some fairly huge conglomerations of these hoopworlds, like a chain. 

There’s no gravity in the center of these, and it’s very weak as you move out from the center, so you could but your hoops there, or do an even more classic chain setup if you put some sort of thin frictionless strip around the equators and slammed in a sturdy atlas pillar, like we discussed last time, of great strength to keep the world from bumping, and you could then create a long chain all the way around a star. 

A Chainworld if you would. 

Now we need to talk about both gravity and seasons. 

Gravity is pretty tricky. 

All symmetric objects will have zero gravity in their exact center, but only for a hollow sphere is gravity zero everywhere inside it. 

For a ring or Torus, as you move radially outward from the center gravity begins pulling on you more and more toward the nearest part of the ring. 

That’s why getting a moon in there is very tricky since it could be very easily perturbed and crash into the ring. 

If you go up or down from the center gravity points back to the middle but only straight toward the middle if you’re up or down from the center. 

Now gravity on or near the ring points basically in the right direction, down to the ring, but it’s weaker on the inside than the outside and stronger at the poles. 

There’s no simple equation for doing this and it will vary on how big the major and minor radius are to each other, but keeping it just conceptual, here on the inner equator, because our hoopworld spins to have night and day, gravity is somewhat stronger than on the outer equator because of centrifugal force. 

The hoop is spinning, on the inside that centrifugal force pushes in the same direction as gravity, on the outside it is in the opposite direction and makes you lighter. 

Gravity is stronger near the poles and especially on the inner side where centrifugal force adds rather than subtracts to normal gravity. 

Here’s a model Anders Sandberg created of that gravity, for a Hoopworld best approximating Earth conditions, he did a nice article one the subject from the standpoint of naturally occurring hoopworlds over on ANDART, which is linked in the video description, and is another of the old hands over at Orion’s Arm, which is the group that basically inspired this entire series and to which I’m an infrequent contributor. 

Sandberg is also a neuroscientist and one of the leading minds on transhumanism so I’ll be referencing a lot his work in the upcoming video on that subject. 

I’ve heard it suggested that hoopworlds will probably have very spectacular aurorae and it’s also worth noting that it’s the nature of such an object, already have a huge radius, that it’s geostationary orbit is going to be very low, so space elevators on these are pretty simple to build and about an order of magnitude shorter than one for Earth would be. 

And while the central point of the ring isn’t terribly stable you can build elevators out to that and stabilize it by just having three lines running up to a central port, which since pi is about 3 and the circumference is pi times the diameter is as many as you’d probably want to build to expedite movement around the ring. 

Okay, weather. 

First we can tilts these just like Earth is to have seasons. 

As the planet orbits the sun the side tilted toward it gets more light, same as the north and south hemispheres get more light for half the year each, though I guess it would be hemi-hoop here. 

Second, unlike the discworld and like other normal spherical worlds there is a temperature difference between the equator and… well we can’t call them poles, northern and southern rings I suppose. 

But it is what you’d expect, equator warmer than northern and southern regions, but only the outer equator, the inner equator is colder since it doesn’t get as much light. 

Weather for a hoop is hard to predict, because gravity varies significantly too with latitude, and because a hoop has so much more centrifugal and Coriolis force driving its weather. 

So it would be pretty volatile, but on the whole plausibly Earth-like, and so long as the hoop spins once every 24 hours you could find places congruous to our native habitats. 

There is a lot more to this concept, but that’s where we’ll wrap it for today, Sandberg’s attached article covers a lot more of the nuts and bolts if you want to learn more. 

Next time in the Megastructures series we’ll be taking our first look at star encompassing megastructures with Shkadov Thrusters, a technique for moving entire stars, the simplest form a Dyson Sphere to build. 

We touched on Dyson Sphere concepts in the Dyson Dilemma video and its remake but we didn’t do anything like properly explore it and that’s where we’ll be heading next in the Megastructures series, starting with the Shkadov Thruster. 

But before that we’ll be skipping back to the Habitable Series for a look at Double Planets, which as mentioned is two of the routes in nature which could conceivably produce a naturally occurring hoopworld.

Fermi Paradox: The Dyson Dilemma v2.0
---
  
2016-04-08  
https://youtu.be/QfuK8la0y6s  

---

So with a year and half and a couple dozen videos between now and when I did the original Dyson Dilemma video I thought it was about time to revisit the Fermi Paradox and I thought it was a good idea to start by releasing more updated and improved versions of the early material. 

That includes this subject and its main companion video where we try to take a brief but detailed look at all the proposed solutions to the Fermi Paradox. 

Since the original Dyson Dilemma video this is replacing tended to be the gateway video for the channel, meaning odds are this is the first time you are hearing me, let me say now what I forgot to say then. 

I have a speech impediment, I cannot pronounce the letter R as in Rascally Rabbits. 

Some folks find me hard to understand so all these videos come with closed captions subtitles and you probably want to turn those on now. 

Now if you don’t already know what the Fermi Paradox is, it’s the apparent paradox between the sheer size and age of the Universe and the seeming absence of any other intelligent life besides ourselves. 

Our Universe consists of billions of galaxies each likely hosting billions of potentially habitable planets that have been around for billions of years. 

That none of these worlds would host life, even when many trillions of them will be the same size and temperature as Earth, is a notion that seems paradoxical, as does the idea that none of them spawned intelligent technological civilizations like our own. 

In the companion video we’ll look at a lot of the ideas that have been proposed over the years to explain this absence of aliens, this Great Silence among the stars, and we single out some of the better candidates for their own in-depth videos, but today we’ll be looking at the notion that Alien Technological Civilizations come into existence so infrequently that none have ever existed in our own galaxy or likely in any of the million or so nearest galaxies. 

I’ll be arguing to you that the strongest piece of evidence against alien civilizations existing anywhere near us is the simple fact that we can see stars in our own night sky. 

That the visibility of those stars, the very reason we took such an interest in the heavens and learned how truly immense the Universe was, represents the strongest proof there’s nobody else nearby us to share it. 

But the problem with most Fermi Paradox solutions is that tend to revolve around the classic science fiction concept of flying out in faster than light ships to settle world after world. 

As we’ve explored in other videos, realistically even if you can find a way around the speed of light, this image is probably flawed and by and large we won’t go out and terraform planets, will outright build them instead, and that alters the equation of the Fermi Paradox a lot, because we have to contemplate what civilizations with serious robotic automation and near unlimited energy would do. 

To explain that we need to talk about the hypothetical megastructure called a Dyson Sphere. 

In the megastructures playlist we’ve looked at giant artificial structure thousands of miles long and even outright manufacturing artificial planets, but Dyson Spheres take that a bit further. 

Earth gets virtually all its energy from the Sun, but less than a billionth of the Sun’s energy falls on Earth and even if you throw in every planet and asteroid in our solar system only a fraction of a millionth of the Sun’s energy lands on them with the rest flying off into the void, totally wasted. 

If you wanted harness that energy you would want to surround your entire sun, and we call this a Dyson Sphere. 

Now conceptually you can think of it as a single giant rigid spherical shell around a star but that wasn’t what Freeman Dyson had in mind when he suggested it nor what scientists mean when discussing it. 

We usually mean a massive collection of orbiting bodies, ranging from giant rotating habitats like we discussed in episode 4 of the megastructures series or huge swarms of solar power collectors. 

For this reason you will sometimes hear these called Dyson Swarms instead, to emphasize that it’s basically a big cloud of smaller objects not one big rigid shell, but for our purposes today it doesn’t make a difference. 

Now we’ll discuss some of the things you might do with all that energy, how you would go about building one, where you’d come up with all material to build one, and why you would want to build a Dyson Sphere later. 

For the moment what matters is that if a civilization wants to keep expanding it can go to other stars or build up around its own, or both. 

The Dyson Dilemma hinges on showing they’d want to do both, could do both, and could do both on a timeline that while very long to us is very short in the context of the age of the Universe. 

The timelines needed for a species to double its own numbers, if it has the inclination and resources to do so, is incredibly small compared to the timeline of the Universe. 

It does not really matter if an organism has generations lasting only a day or a thousand years, they can fill up space very quickly. 

It only takes ten generations of doubling, just a few centuries, to increase your population a thousand-fold. 

So if a carbon copy of Earth existed around every yellow sun in the galaxy and we could get people there, we could fill up all those billions of solar systems in about a thousand years. 

The upside of a Dyson Sphere is that a single one of them contains nearly as much living area as an entire galaxy. 

Our own population quadrupled during the last century, doubling basically every fifty years, but even if it took a thousand years to double we’d have a billion times as many people, enough to fill a Dyson Sphere or a galaxy of Earth-like planets, in only 30,000 years. 

For contrast, if you took a film of the galaxy from when the Universe was young until now, and ran it at high speed so it played out in an hour, you could miss the whole of human history by blinking, and if you blinked again when such an expansion was going on, even a slow one, you could be looking at a lone inhabited planet when you started that second blink and an entire filled galaxy when you were done. 

But if they’ve been building Dyson Spheres around every star as they went, you wouldn’t see anything since all the stars in a galaxy would be obscured by the Dyson Spheres. 

Even restrained by the Speed of Light you can fill up a galaxy in just a hundred thousand, maybe a few millions years. 

And if travel time is your bottleneck to expansion your population growth could move at a glacial pace and still keep up with it. 

That’s the Dyson Dilemma in short, if an expanding civilization has the ability and desire to spread out to other stars and slowly englobe each one with a Dyson Sphere until you can’t see any stars at all, and even if they take tens of millions of years to do this, that is such a short period of time compared to how old the Universe is that you’d expect tons of civilizations to have already done this. 

They could have encircled every star in the galaxy and even moved on to other galaxies, but even if no one in our galaxy had reached that point yet or arrived from elsewhere, we’d still be able to see half-eaten galaxies billions of light years away. 

We could see that going on so far away that we can actually discount the more distant locations simply because the light we see from them is so old we wouldn’t expect anything to have had a chance to evolve there yet. 

But obviously we don’t. 

Same as with radio signals from other civilizations we’ve never found a single Dyson Sphere, let alone countless millions of them. 

We can draw two different but reasonable conclusions off this. 

First, they aren’t there because there’s no one there to build them. 

Either technological civilizations evolve incredibly rarely or they kill themselves off long before being able to build such things, a concept we explored in the Fermi Paradox Apocalypse How video, where we tried to look at every plausible doomsday scenario for technological civilizations and which we’ll be looking at again soon in the Carter Doomsday Argument video. 

So civilizations able to build these might be very rare or short-lived. 

The second option is that they either can’t build them or don’t wish to do so. 

We’ll be focus our attention on that idea, and the problems with it, for the rest of the video, but first one quick side note. 

I mentioned that you couldn’t see these stars because they’re surrounded, but that’s not quite true and the source of a lot of confusion about Dyson Spheres. 

They’re not invisible, just invisible to the naked eye. 

Objects that absorb energy, like light from a sun, will begin to warm up, they will also radiate energy away. 

The hotter they are, the faster they radiate heat, double something’s temperature, its absolute temperature, and it will pump out 16 times the radiated heat, it will also emit that at a frequency or wavelength of light dependent on the temperature. 

Things at room temperature, like planets with liquid water, or artificial habitats constructed to house people, will radiate their heat away in a frequency of light invisible to the naked eye but quite visible to our modern equipment and every bit as much power will leave them as they absorb. 

Dyson Spheres tend to be a pretty popular type of suggested Dark Matter, that doesn’t work for a whole host of reasons but it mostly comes from the false impression these things are completely dark, when in reality a Dyson Sphere is about the least subtle thing a civilization could ever build. 

The only way you could hide on would be with the sorts of entropy-defying technology that would render one a bit redundant, but more on that in a while. 

Summary version, they can’t be seen with the naked eye but are as easy to see as any other star. 

So can you build one of these? 

Can you get to other stars to build more of them? 

And would you want to? 

I’m going to lay out six conditions that if true make the Dyson Dilemma function, though as we’ll see in most cases where you could break these conditions it doesn’t really alter the situation much. 

We’ll lay these conditions out then explore their justification and possible flaws, I’ve switched them up a bit from the original video to be a bit clearer and more comprehensive. 

Condition #1: It is actually possible to build a Dyson Sphere, and doing so makes sense. 

Obviously if you can’t build one, or have no reason to, the whole Dilemma is redundant. 

We’ll talk about how you can build one in a bit as well as why you would build one. 

Condition #2: It is possible to engage in interstellar colonization. 

This is interesting because science-fiction tends to imply a Dyson Sphere is way-high tech and far harder to build then to go terraform planets in other solar systems, which is pretty much wrong in every respect, but it means people tend to assume if you can do #1 then you can do #2 as well. 

But for our purposes, if you can’t get to other stars it also breaks the Dyson Dilemma because unless alien civilizations are incredibly common we could actually miss a Dyson Sphere even fairly close to us at the galactic scale, and the premise of this concept is that we would see huge emerging dark spheres, or infrared spheres, of stars disappearing as they got encompassed in a slowly expanding wave, even galaxies away. 

Condition #3: No method of power generation exists which is vastly superior to stars, nor can matter and energy simply be summoned from nowhere for free. 

Now what I mean by this is basically perpetual motion machines and free lunches. 

The purpose of building a Dyson Sphere is to tap into all that energy that’s already being produced. 

If you’ve got something that’s better, and so much better you wouldn’t even care about the free energy a star emits, then you’ve wouldn’t build one. 

Though as we’ll see in most cases this would result in even larger and more visible civilizations. 

Condition #4: Faster Than Light Travel or Travel to other Realities or Dimensions, is either not possible or not incredibly easy. 

Again the premise is that we’d see solar system after solar system disappearing in a loose sphere or blob, because they want those solar systems and they grab the nearest ones first. 

If you can just step into some alternate reality that hosts an uninhabited carbon copy of your homeworld, you don’t really need to expand off world. 

Certain types of Faster Than Light travel also wouldn’t produce that expanding blob, more on that in a while. 

Our last two conditions are more psychological than scientific. 

Condition #5: Civilizations do not inevitably wipe themselves out. 

That’s an important caveat because if you kill yourself off it’s sort of hard to colonize a galaxy. 

This condition doesn’t mean no civilizations self-destruct, just that it isn’t inevitable. 

Condition #6: Most civilizations will expand their population, territory, and resources if they can comfortably do so. 

This tends to be the most controversial part of the list, I’m not quite sure why, most folks nod their heads and say duh, but it does seem to rub a very vocal minority the entirely wrong way so I’ll save that for last and for the moment just point out the emphasis on ‘comfortably do so’. 

So let’s discuss these conditions and see how they can be true and what it means if they aren’t. 

Condition #1 I think bugs folks because they have that image of a Dyson Sphere as a giant rigid shell requiring super-technologies, what I tend to call Clarketech, to build, and access to vast amounts of raw materials. 

None of which is true. 

Building Dyson Swarms isn’t high-tech at all, and while it’s a massive project, so is building homes for a few hundred million people. 

Building homes and factories and farms is something you do gradually with an ever increasing pool of manpower to help and fundamentally that is what a Dyson Swarm is. 

Also unlike the rigid sphere version, you can build it gradually. 

You start with a few components and just keep adding to it as need demands and you stop when you’re using up all your sunlight. 

Individual components of a Dyson Swarm could be almost anything. 

Rotating habitats that simulate conditions on Earth or giant computer processors for some swollen Artificial Intelligence. 

Swarms of power collectors. 

They don’t have to be very sophisticated, it could literally just be endless wads of modern solar panels. 

Anything that takes sunlight and converts it into something we want. 

There’s no risk of collision of these elements either, none of them generate much gravity and while we think of these swarms as being very dense in order to get every trickle of sunlight, that ignores that space is very big and three dimensional. 

In this model I’ve got up we’re seeing a few hundred objects all tightly packed, in reality we’d be talking trillions of objects all separate by huge distances. 

Solar Panels don’t need to be in the Habitable Zone of a solar system to function but the Habitable zone, the area where you have liquid water, is very wide, especially when the things in them are artificial and can have non-spherical geometries. 

You’d probably build your swarm up as one ring of satellites at a time, cocked at angles. 

If the whole thing was compacted into a shell it might be a few millimeters or a few meters thick, but you will be spreading that over a depth of tens of millions of miles. 

Even a really dense Swarm would be about as dense compared to air as air is to lead. 

Now you might need to give things the occasional corrective shove or blast some space debris with lasers but you’ve got the entire power output of star to work with so it’s not hard to do that. 

The other issue is what you do with all that power. 

The default use is to just light artificial habitats, but there’s lots of applications, we talked about using stars to make micro-black holes to power starships recently on the channel, but another application addresses the other big issue of making a Dyson Sphere, which is where you get all the mass. 

Now again, a Dyson doesn’t necessarily require much mass. 

If you’ve got millimeter thick solar panels surrounding a sun at the distance Mercury is from the Sun, then Mercury alone would have enough mass. 

That gets you your solar panels. 

As to where you get the mass for thicker stuff like Rotating Habitats, once you run out raw materials from among the planets and asteroids orbiting the Sun, well, you use the Sun itself. 

The Sun out masses everything in the solar system by a couple orders of magnitude, by a couple more if you are only counting rocky worlds with metal not gas giants, and it get its power from turning hydrogen into helium by fusion. 

Something we’d like to be able to do ourselves at a more compact scale as we discussed in the video on the Impact of Fusion. 

You can also turn helium into carbon, the stuff we make all those cool new super materials like Graphene and Carbon Nantoubes out of. 

Many older stars do exactly that as they run out of Hydrogen in their cores. 

We may well be able to turn hydrogen into helium for an energy profit ourselves in the not too distant future and eventually be able to make energy by fusing even heavier elements into things like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, and so on. 

Our big problem right now isn’t that we can’t turn hydrogen into helium, or transmute other elements, we do it in the lab all the time, our problem is we have to spend way more energy doing it then we get out of it. 

It takes a lot of energy by our current methods to make heavier elements from lighter ones… of course if you’ve got all the energy of a sun to play with and you need those heavier elements so you can have more than mostly solar panels, well, the solution is pretty obvious. 

No process is too inefficient if you’ve got a massive surplus of power you’re not using for anything else. 

So you could convert Jupiter or Saturn into carbon bit by bit to build stuff from. 

But you can also pull matter straight off a sun. 

There’s a few ways to do this but the common concept is called starlifting, which is basically where you use a star’s own power output to magnetically pull off gas from its upper atmosphere which would constantly replenish from the compacted hot gases below. 

This is killing two birds with one stone since you can convert that matter into stuff that can more practically take advantage of all that light, while decreasing the star’s mass to make it live longer and glow less brightly, meaning you don’t need as much material to properly Dyson it. 

In fact smaller stars not only live longer but are more efficient too, with the smallest ones converting virtually all their hydrogen into helium and energy whereas the big ones often die before converting even a tenth of it. 

So you if don’t have enough mass in a solar system to do much more than make thin solar collectors around your sun, you can yank matter right off the star to reduce its brightness, meaning you don’t need as much mass to encompass it, while giving you more material to encompass it with more useful constructs. 

Ideally your means of transmutation would produce energy for you to use too, but if you’ve got to just have a big supercollider running around your star slamming atoms together to make bigger ones at a hugely inefficient rate, so be it, it’s not like that power would be used for anything else. 

All the energy is forever lost and unusable. 

It’s hard for me to imagine advanced civilizations, even ones that didn’t want more of themselves, not grinding and gnashing their teeth at that waste. 

Energy that could be used for anything from making artificial habitats for nature reserves of endangered animals to being stored for eventual use when the star dies. 

On any given star there would eventually be a nice comfortable optimum between the mass you needed to build the Dyson you want around it and the brightness is had. 

Sounds really high tech, and hopefully it would be too since again our current methods of transmutation are very wasteful, but it’s not something you need new physics for. 

Same for the construction process. 

There’s nothing high tech there, though more tech is better. 

Can you make a satellite and put it in orbit around the Sun? 

Yes. 

Great, now make a trillion them, you’ve got a Dyson Swarm. 

You need a real off-planet infrastructure to do this stuff, but mining and building in space is not tricky, it’s getting the initial components up there to begin with that’s tricky. 

We looked at some ways of doing in the early episodes of the Megastructures series. 

Space Elevators, Orbital Rings, Skyhooks, Mass Drivers, Launch Loops, and Space Fountains all hold a lot of promise and you can click on that video link if you want to learn more. 

Like all the other video links on this channel they just pause this video and open the other one up in a new window. 

So that’s condition #1 settled. 

You can build a Dyson, you just do it as resources and need permit and require. 

The motivation for doing so is simply that you want to use all that otherwise wasted power, what you use it for would depend on what you want. 

Even if you’re non-expansionist you can always use that power to store it for the super long-term usage, we previously discussed using black holes as massive batteries that will last as long compared to stars as stars do to light bulbs, but there’s several mundane ways to store energy long term, not as efficient but even 1% efficiency is better than nothing at all. 

So even if you don’t want the power now, that is one example of how you could use it just prolong your civilization long after our sun and every other one had burned out. 

Not every hypothetical civilization we’ll consider today resembles our own, the Dyson Dilemma works just fine even if the civilization is one massive single artificial super-intelligence, often called a Matryoshka Brain, that just runs ridiculous amounts of computing power off a whole sun. 

Condition #2 was that Interstellar Colonization is possible. 

We did a whole video on that not long back so I’ll keep discussion of that short now. 

You can watch that for explanations of how Interstellar Colonization should be viable even if we never invent any cool new physics that makes it way easier. 

It’s also very easy to get the power to send colony ships when you already have a Dyson Swarm in place, or even just part of Dyson Swarm. 

In that video we discussed a lot of options, and we extended on that in the Black Hole Starship video, but the simplest one that definitely would work if you had a lot of solar collectors around you sun is just to shove your ships up to a good fraction of light speed with lasers powered by those collectors slamming off mirrors on the back of the ship. 

Though slowing down at your destination is a bit of a problem. 

We looked at a lot of the other options for doing this in the Interstellar Colonization video, including how to slow down, but if you’ve got a decent start on building a Dyson Swarm you can get the job done. 

It might take a century for your colony ships to arrive and Terraforming a Planet is pretty time consuming too, as we discussed in the video on that, but centuries and even thousands of years are nothing in the context of astronomical time And I repeat that point a lot because it tends to be the big conceptual problem people have with the Fermi Paradox. 

We’ll come back to this point in a bit and talk about the Hart Conjecture of the mid 70’s, which the Dyson Dilemma is sort of an extension of, and the concept that mostly blunted SETI as a major endeavor. 

Condition #3 revolves around basically eliminating Dyson Spheres as useful objects. 

Fundamentally the point of a Dyson Sphere is to convert stars into useful engines for whatever purpose. 

If you’ve got way better sources of power and materials than stars you probably wouldn’t bother to build one. 

Now that would have to involve new physics, physics that if it exists at all we don’t understand at all, so there’s not much point talking about it except in two regards. 

We can’t really speculate much about weird new physical laws we don’t even have a theoretical basis for, but if you’ve got ways to just ignore entropy you don’t need stars anymore and you actually can hide your civilization and you don’t need to expand because you basically have infinite resources available already. 

But this is a problem in the Fermi Paradox because you also have no reason to hide either. 

No one else has a motivation to expand, and you might as well just broadcast off your trick for cheating thermodynamics so everybody knows it and has no reason to expand and threaten you. 

If they’ve got the same trick, they don’t need to expand either, whereas if they don’t they do, and they might come kicking on your door in anger just for withholding the technique, a conundrum we’ll talk about more in the Companion video looking at other Fermi Paradox Solutions. 

If you gain nothing by attacking others, you need a motivation like revenge to drive you on, like for instance “Those selfish, apathetic bastards didn’t share their super-technology with us when doing so would have saved countless lives and cost them nothing.” This wouldn’t mean they never left home. 

With those kinds of power resources travel between stars wouldn’t be hard, and they might just be curious. 

We are, that’s kind of how we got all our technology to begin with. 

Curiosity might not be a universal trait of technological civilizations but it’s hard to imagine it is a rare one, and an ultra-energy rich civilization with no plausible fear of other civilizations that possess curiosity ought to be fairly chatty with its neighbors. 

As mentioned, we’ll talk about that concept more in the companion video where we survey the various other solutions to the Fermi Paradox. 

Alternatively if you still have to obey normal physical laws but just have some way better power source, like being able to convert matter directly into energy, then you actually worsen the Dyson Dilemma, since expansion is much easier, and you still have a motivation to do it. 

You wouldn’t Dyson Swarm your own sun, but it would still go dark since you’d want to disassemble it for fuel, now or in the distant future. 

Plus such a civilization would still glow very bright in the infrared region, probably brighter than a normal Dyson Swarm would, so ultimately only entropy-violating technology really gets you out of the Dyson Dilemma and Condition #3 ends up holding even for most technologies that violate our known physical laws. 

Either by replacing Dyson Spheres with even more visible objects or by creating a situation in which there’s no reason to be silent. 

Condition #4 is much the same. 

The new series on the Channel about hypothetical Faster Than Light Technologies, FTL, looks at this subject in more detail, though I like to be upfront with viewers that I personally don’t think real FTL is in the cards. 

It bugs people when I suggest we can build star-encompassing megastructures but that the Millennium Falcon is out of our reach, but it’s a Great Wall of China versus Jetpack kind of thing. 

One, while it certainly benefits from higher technology, is really just about manpower and effort, the other requires breakthroughs that might be a long time coming or never. 

There are some promising leads that let us maybe cheat the speed of light, and we talk about them in the FTL series, but for the purpose of this video FTL is an example of where even if you’ve got it then it actually exacerbates the Fermi Paradox. 

If you can get to stars in days not decades, Interstellar Colonization is pretty much a given and you can fill up a galaxy quite quickly. 

This doesn’t eliminate the need for Dyson Spheres though, it just delays it for a while. 

Once you’ve filled up all the decent planets you’d still need to build Dyson Spheres if you want to expand more, and that would still probably happen as an expanding sphere as the homeworld and oldest colonies near it fill up first and opt to build Dyson’s. 

The exception to that is any type of FTL that doesn’t even care about distance. 

If you can just pop anywhere you want regardless of how far away it is then you pick the most Earth-like uninhabited planets in the whole Universe and that wouldn’t result in that expanding Sphere of Darkness. 

On the other hand if you’ve got super-easy transport anywhere you probably have very rapid colonization and expansion since for a long while there’s no motivation to curb population growth at all and absolutely no way to enforce it. 

So you wouldn’t get the expanding sphere but you would get massive population growth everywhere and even 2 people, ignoring the inbreeding issues, could fill the whole Universe up with their descendants in less time than it took for us to go from stone spears to steam engines. 

Then they’d have to turn to Dyson Spheres. 

This is actually one of the major reasons I’m dubious about FTL ever being possible, I can imagine that intelligent life is pretty rare, and that the nearest ones are so far away the light from their emerging civilization hasn’t reached us yet, but the whole Universe has to come into play if you’ve got FTL, and maybe the whole timeline of the Universe since FTL also usually implies time travel. 

Our current physics calls it outright impossible, and it’s easier for me to imagine us never having FTL workarounds that let us get to places we’ve never been to before faster than light than that the whole Universe, which is way bigger than even the Observable Universe if not actually outright infinite in size, never gave rise to anyone else besides us. 

Though we’ll look at that possibility in the companion video as well. 

The real killer for the Dyson Dilemma from condition #4 is if anyone ever figures out a way to pop into alternate realities, if they exist. 

Because then there is a virtually infinite and possible literally infinite number of copies of your own world that are the same except nobody lives there yet. 

You don’t bother building Dyson Spheres or Terraforming planets if you’ve got an infinite number of Earths at your finger tips. 

You might still have a very impressive space program since you’d also have all those worlds to draw resources and funding from, but it will be for science, and prestige efforts. 

You might travel to the South Pole just to prove you can do it, but you never try to make it livable if you’ve got lots of nicer places that are also closer at hand. 

So no expansion wave, you might big build transmitters and dishes to try talking to or listening for alien civilizations, but there’s no galaxy encompassing outward expansion wave. 

And again, if you’re not expanding, then the Dyson Dilemma isn’t really applicable. 

The issue with finding aliens and not being able to hear them right now isn’t an issue if they are staying homebound unless you think that alien civilizations are so common there are millions of them in this galaxy. 

We could miss a carbon copy of our own civilization even just a thousand light years away and they could miss us. 

That detection range is constantly expanding but it’s still pretty small right now, on a galactic scale. 

That’s the concept for SETI, ultimately, and why the Hart Conjecture damaged that effort so much. 

And it is the Hart Conjecture that the Dyson Dilemma ultimately revolves around. 

Back in the earlier 50’s when the Fermi Paradox was first raised we were just learning how huge and old the Universe was, we didn’t have any space program at all, and we were mass producing nukes as the Cold War got started. 

Nor did we have anything like the telescopes we now have. 

So at the time the answer seemed pretty obvious, civilizations have their homeworld and they are stuck on it, for good or ill, and those tended to be rather pessimistic times right after two world wars and the invention of nukes. 

Enrico Fermi, for whom the paradox is named, is also known as the architect of the nuclear age and the atomic bomb, and he was also firmly opposed to construction of the H-bomb, so he wasn’t noted for his optimism about mankind’s long-term survivability. 

Now by the mid-70’s there was a bit more optimism. 

Man had walked on the moon, we hadn’t nuked ourselves, and we had some very tangible theoretical designs and models for not just interplanetary but interstellar spaceships. 

So we had to start taking very seriously the notion that interstellar colonization might be feasible. 

Astrophysicist Michael Hart wrote a very pivotal paper that actually spawned the Fermi Paradox as an official concept and term, and it was called the Fermi-Hart Paradox for some time. 

I’ve attached a link to that paper in the video description below that you can read but the summary form, and what it means, is basically that since it appears alien civilizations could have arisen millions or even billions of years ahead of, and since Interstellar colonization seems possible, then our problem isn’t that we can’t hear radio signals from distant alien homeworlds, is that we can’t hear them from the leading edge of their colonization expansion wave or that we’re even here to listen since malicious aliens might have just taken our planet back when animals living on land was become all the new fashion. 

And sure, nice aliens might leave our planet alone but they ought to have a pretty close and easily observed outpost we could hear, not just their distant homeworld. 

A few years later Frank Tipler added onto this, with what is known as the Hart Tipler Conjecture, and basically just amounts to pointing out that automated probes with construction ability made interstellar colonization even easy, something miniaturization and 3D printing would strongly indicate is so. 

The notion of using robots as some kind of groundbreaking concept might seem a bit alien nowadays but remember this was when computers smaller a car that you could play tic-tac-toe was still considered brand new. 

The big weakness of SETI, and the source of a lot of criticism towards it, tends to be this concept though, that if alien civilizations are around it’s not their homeworlds we need to look for, it’s their nearest colonies, which ought to be everywhere by now if even one civilization had arisen in the galaxy even just a few million years ahead of us. 

Of course they might all be dead, having never expanded and not have transmitted radio signals for very long. 

Which brings us to condition #5. 

Condition #5, the notion that species don’t inevitably wipe themselves out, was something we looked at in detail in the Fermi Paradox Apocalypse How video, and we saw there that actually taking a civilization out for keeps was a lot harder than we tend to think. 

But in the context of the Fermi Paradox it doesn’t matter if some do blow themselves up, it matters if some don’t. 

If a thousand civilization arose in our galaxy in the last billion years, it would only have taken one of them not killing themselves off and going on to expand, or even just not killing themselves off but deciding expansion wasn’t viable but a great big radio transmitter was, to break the Great Silence. 

And if expansion isn’t viable then you don’t need to be afraid of someone kicking your door down and taking your planet since they can’t, so you might as well talk to others. 

The key word in condition 5 is inevitable, because a thousand civilizations coming into existence over a billion years in our galaxy is actually pretty pessimistic odds for development, since there probably being tens of millions of near replicas of Earth-like planets life might have spawned on in our galaxy alone. 

Yet the Dyson Dilemma goes beyond our galaxy to encompass any close enough for us to be able to have received light from that galaxy which isn’t so old no planets there could have plausibly developed civilizations when that light left. 

Even if you’re on the pessimistic side about technological civilizations emerging, say just one per galaxy so far, that’s a lot of galaxies in range, millions of them, and it’s hard to imagine civilizations kill themselves off even 99% of the time, which would still mean at only one per galaxy and only 1% surviving that many thousands had done so that we could see. 

And keep in mind, it only counts for the Fermi Paradox if the obliteration results in no intelligent life with any desire to expand remaining. 

So a hyper-aggressive artificial intelligence that wipes out its creators doesn’t count any more than our replacement of Neanderthals does. 

Again we go over this in more detail in the Apocalypse How video but for our purposes so long as any decently non-zero percentage of civilizations survive it doesn’t work for the Fermi Paradox. 

This leads us to our last condition, #6. 

Most civilizations will expand their population, territory, and resources if they can comfortably do so. 

I’ve never heard a good counterargument to this, and I’m quite receptive to them since even though the Dyson Dilemma is my own brainchild I actually despise it, I detest the notion that the Universe could be so huge and old yet basically empty, so I keep an ear out for any good challenges to the idea. 

But so far the closest and most common one is usually to point out that developed nations have low or even negative birth rates. 

That obviously is not a counterargument and I blame myself for not putting the word comfortably in bold last time. 

Find me a historic example of where a civilization for at least ten generations existed well bellowing it’s carrying capacity – which is the maximum population a given place can support with available technology – and had no growth that entire time and I will revisit this issue. 

And remember, well below carrying capacity, which would mean they could support, with what they had for space and technology, many times what they did, and had ZERO growth the whole time. 

If you can’t find one of those then you’ve no valid contradiction of condition #6. 

At least not a historical or modern one, and there certainly isn’t an example in nature, organisms on Earth reproduce even when it’s not only not comfortable but actively a bad idea to do so. 

Only the food chain and predators keep that in check and technological civilizations wouldn’t be expected to have any predators preying on them. 

And this being the Fermi Paradox, we still only care if everyone does it, not if some or even most do it. 

So even if we could find a historical example of where a stable civilization had existed for many generations with no growth when they could comfortably have increased their numbers, it changes little since it’s the example of any civilization that has grown when it could do so that actually causes the Dilemma and there’s obviously tons of those. 

This is made even worse if a civilization develops means of seriously prolonging lifespans, a concept we’ll examine when we take a look at Transhumanism &amp; Immortality in the near future. 

When you live thousands or even millions of years it’s hard to imagine you wouldn’t want to have a child at least once in all that time, if there’s no pressing resource shortage to deter you. 

When you’re building Dyson Spheres you’re also not knocking over forests, your building habitats from previously dead rock that forests can grow in. 

To break condition #6 you need to show that intelligent civilizations consider a dead asteroid to be more valuable than living organisms, or digital artificial intelligences, same difference. 

And you need to show they all would, because if even one in a million didn’t, then they would rapidly outnumber the other million civilizations combined. 

Evolution favors aggressive critters who like to multiply, and the difference with intelligent creatures is that they will at least consider curbing their growth when not doing so endangers them as a culture, but the whole point of condition #6 is that they will grow if it doesn’t endanger them. 

Nor are all those rocks in space some sort of eternal stockpile you can tap at need. 

Orbits decay, flinging asteroids and planets out into the void or dumping them into stars. 

Stars themselves burn through mountains worth of fusion fuel every day and convert that into power that is forever wasted. 

It’s not knocking over virgin forest for farmland, its use or lose resources that diminish every year and serve no purpose unused. 

Now there’s no breaks in condition #6 that I’ve heard of, but there are a couple maybes that get brought up, they don’t appear to work but on initial inspection sound like they do. 

The first is that is that civilizations might go digital. 

Convert yourself into a computer or get replaced by them. 

That’s entirely plausible, but it doesn’t really matter. 

You ought to be able to support a lot more people off the same power supply if they’re cyborgs or outright computer programs, growing food isn’t a terribly efficient process compared to just running yourself on electricity if you can do it. 

But sort of like how Faster Than Light travel just delays the Dyson Dilemma while you fill up easy to reach and terraform planets, you will still get a maximum population of computer-people. 

No matter how much more efficient you make your processing and data storage you will max out eventually and then if you want to expand more you need to move outwards to empty spaces or import material from elsewhere. 

We’ll look at the concept of such societies more in the aforementioned Transhumanism video and also in the one on the Simulation Hypothesis, the notion that we might all live inside a giant computer program, but it doesn’t change that if you want more people, you eventually need external resources. 

And why would you not want more people? 

More artists, more scientists, more actors and musicians and novelists and great thinkers. 

But a better way of looking at it would be would you be willing to kill to stop it? 

Because even if you and most of your civilization likes your total population just as it is, unless that opinion is universally held by every member of your civilization… and every other civilization… you’d have to be willing to actually chase down and blow up any rebellious members of your civilization guilty of wanting to setup shop elsewhere. 

Or somebody is going to do it and odds are their descendants will share their expansionist preferences. 

Of course it could be a single mind, the giant planet-sized or sun-sized computer. 

And it might have no desire to reproduce, it doesn’t want to send a seed to another solar system to become a rival. 

That still doesn’t really matter though because it just announced a motivation, it doesn’t want a rival, meaning it probably wants to live. 

Which could probably be taken for granted since while biological organisms have survival built in, and would probably transmit that as part of their cultural mindset and ideology even to non-biological descendants, it’s kind of hard to imagine survival-oriented civilizations being wiped out by an entity or entities that weren’t survival oriented. 

And in that motivation, especially for some giant super-mind, we get the same expansion wave. 

It’s life is really measured not in classic time but in total processes done, Flops or Floating Point Operations, but either way, the more calculation power it has and the longer it can run them, the better, and I already mentioned how things like black holes can be used to store power for insane periods of time even compared to solar lifetimes. 

You don’t need full-blown human level intelligence on your robot probes sent out to strip mine other solar systems to bring those resources back to your hoard, and you can even make a Dysons Swarm out of stars. 

Not only can you use a star’s own power to pull mass off it, you can use a star’s own power to move it. 

All Dyson Spheres are starships. 

Very slow ones, but you can reflect your sunlight or waste heat or both asymmetrically rather than omnidirectionally to provide thrust. 

There all sorts of ways you can harvest your galaxy and crunch it in to a smaller volume for long term storage, just from available known science, so if you’re a big omnibrain who just wants to live as long as you can hoping to figure out an ultimate cheat code for entropy and the heat death of the Universe, sending non-sentient robots to harvest everything in sight for your hoard will do the trick. 

And the same for any other civilization too. 

A culture might decide it only wants X number of people and really will kill off anyone who tries to flee to found a new colony, maybe they fear physical or ideological mutation will ultimately spawn an enemy, but that doesn’t stop them from wanting to persist as long as possible and harvesting the galaxy remotely, and such a reverse blockade, keeping anyone from leaving, is much easier to enforce if you’ve got millions of semi-intelligent robotic harvesting fleets roaming the galaxy who can notice, attack, monitor, or report anyone who managed to sneak away. 

So that’s the Dyson Dilemma, fundamentally the concept that while life might be incredibly common in the Universe, technological civilizations are probably so rare and spread out that there are none even within a billion light years of us. 

The biggest point of evidence for it being that we can see stars with our own eyes. 

Why this should be, that technological civilizations are so rare, the Dyson Dilemma doesn’t answer, and we will look at that a bit more properly in the companion video. 

Over in the comprehensive solutions companion video we’ll take a look at a lot of the other proposed Fermi Paradox solutions and look at their strengths and weaknesses, but that’s it for this topic today Comments and questions are welcome, I try to reply to as many as possible.

Faster Than Light ep02: Tachyons and Time Travel
---
  
2016-04-01  
https://youtu.be/-CgxuW203fk  

---

Today our focus is on Tachyons, a hypothetical particle that travels faster than light and has an imaginary mass, and even more so on time travel, which we need to talk about before we get to some of the other subjects like wormholes. 

Last time we talked about the basics of Special Relativity when it came to making time slow down and we cleared up some confusion people often have with that subject before talking about Quantum Entanglement. 

Today we’ll be expanding on those notions a bit so if you haven’t already watched the first episode you should do that now unless you have a pretty solid grasp of Special Relativity already. 

Which is to say if you’ve seen these two equations before and used it several times you’re good, otherwise not. 

Now these equations didn’t show up last time but ought to look fairly familiar. 

Last time we talked about distance and time contracting, today we are more interested in mass. 

So we’ve three new quick concepts to look at. 

Rest mass, the Lorentz Factor, symbolized by the lowercase Greek Gamma, and the Capital Greek Beta. 

That last one is the easiest, when we are dealing with truly relativistic velocities we always talk in terms of the speed of light. 

Something is going .9 c, or .5 c, and we just use Beta for that, if Beta equals .5 then you are going at half the speed of light. 

Saves time and makes for a smaller equation. 

The Lorentz Factor, Gamma is much the same thing, if you calculate gamma for any given speed you can just multiply or divide it by your proper length or time to find out how much time is dilated or length is contracted. 

You can also multiply it by rest mass to figure out what the relativistic mass is. 

Now rest mass is a simple concept but has some tricky aspects. 

It is literally how much mass something has when measured when it isn’t moving, when it is at rest. 

But we usually don’t use non-rest mass, relativistic mass, in favor of just keeping that invariant and thinking in terms of the objects total energy. 

So we use energy, momentum, and rest mass energy together a lot. 

This makes gamma way more convenient but also means we often like to talk in terms of gamma, not Beta, since its effects are more intuitively obvious. 

I mentioned last time that an object moving at 87% of light speed, or Beta = .87, would appear to be scrunched up in the direction of motion by half and have its clock running at half speed, and that one doing 97% would be condensed down to a quarter and have time running at a quarter speed. 

That’s the case for gamma equal 2 and for respectively, and that’s easier to think with. 

Here on this table I have selected gammas by their beta value. 

And as gamma rises time slows down more and more and the energy you need to get to that speed rises sharply. 

As you can see you never quite reach Beta = 1, or light speed, until gamma is infinite, meaning anything with rest mass needs infinite energy to get to light speed. 

And you’d need more than infinity, something of a nonsensical concept, to accelerate anything with rest mass over light speed. 

Of course if anything started off with that speed to begin with, like our tachyons, they wouldn’t need infinite energy to get there, same as photons don’t need infinite energy to be at the speed of light since they have no rest mass. 

This is where imaginary mass comes into play. 

If you pump in a value for Beta of more than 1, say 1.41, then Beta Squared equals 2 and 1-2=-1. 

Now we have a problem again because there’s no real solutions to the square root of a negative number. 

That’s why Rene Descartes, best known for “I think therefore I am”, created what we call an imaginary number, i, which when multiplied by itself equals -1. 

Hopefully you’re already familiar with that because I don’t want to spend time discussing it, but odds are good you don’t know that the reciprocal of i is –i, so when we get 1 over i here we can just replace it with –i, giving us a negative imaginary gamma and a negative imaginary mass. 

We don’t really care about that negative and don’t usually mention it to avoid confusing with negative mass, which we’ll be talking about a lot when we get to the Alcubierre Warp Drive and stable Wormholes, so we usually just say imaginary mass. 

Now imaginary numbers bug people, especially in terms of physics which unlike math is only supposed to deal with reality, but imaginary numbers come up a lot in physics, and even trigonometry features them though we usually hide it. 

And imaginary mass isn’t limited to tachyons, this hypothetical particle now in disfavor, we use it for tachyonic fields for the Higgs Boson too. 

We also use imaginary time in Cosmology. 

Conceptually the easiest way to explain the tachyon running back in time is just to think how as time slows down as you approach the speed of light, freezing at the speed of light, that it just starts running backwards above the speed of light. 

Now Tachyons are a whole class of particles, anything which might move faster than light. 

We don’t assume it to be a single particle like an electron. 

In this context we also have the luxon, any massless particle like the photon or gluon that travels at the speed of light and experiences no internal time, and the Bradyon or Tardyon. 

Tachyon comes from the Greek word for rapid, and Tardy is Latin for slow, whereas Brady is Greek for slow so Bradyon is probably more consistent but neither gets used much. 

But a Bradyon, or Tardyon, would be any normal matter with a rest mass. 

The application of the Tachyon is obvious. 

If you can generate them then you can send them back to a given place and time to be received. 

Time travel telephone or radio, and presumably something you could use to send people back in time too, or homicidal androids. 

The tachyon was first proposed in the early sixties, though it was known as a metaparticle at the time and soon renamed. 

It made a couple appearances in science fiction novels in the seventies but its first use I know of in TV or film was in Doctor Who, during the episode the Leisure Hive whose last installment amusingly was on the day I was born. 

That combined with the obvious time travel application of a particle that moves back in time is why the intro for this series has the doctor who theme. 

It’s going to come up a lot in the series because there are not many situations where you can travel faster than light without traveling back in time. 

I wanted to discuss these issue of Temporal Paradoxes back in episode 1 but I didn’t want to run overly long and Time Travel, pardon the pun, is a time consuming subject. 

Time travel and its paradoxes tend to give people headaches, probably because its use in fiction necessitates it not quite making sense, but today we’ll be trying to explain how it works minus the headache. 

That pretty much ends our interest in the Tachyons though, they are simply a vehicle to time travel and their hypothetical status means we have no proof they exist, they might not exist, and we have no idea how we’d ever detect them if they did. 

So let’s move on to time travel. 

Fortunately it’s also a topic you are probably already acquainted with. 

The two classic examples, in terms of paradox, are known as the Grandfather Paradox and the Casual Loop. 

There are some other ones, but they usually represent the same thing under a different name or minor thematic rather than functional variation. 

The Grandfather Paradox is when you go back in time and keep your grandparents from every meeting, this causing you to never be born, thus preventing you from ever traveling back in time to prevent that meeting, erasing the problem. 

In terms of alternate timelines or Many Worlds theory this can have different effects we’ll come back to in a bit. 

The Casual Loop is the other angle on the paradox. 

Casual Loops, as the name implies, are where effect precedes the cause, or has a sort of chicken and egg thing going on. 

An event causes another event which in turn causes the original one. 

A loop of cause and effect, or a causal loop. 

The evil computer intelligence finds itself losing a war with the human resistance and notes that the leader of the resistance seems to be an abnormally larger factor in the loss and deduces that if he had never existed the resistance would never have existed either or been far weaker. 

So he sends a murderous robot back in time to prevent the birth of said resistance leader by killing his mom. 

The resistance leader sends his own guy back in time to protect his mom who then ends up being his father and forewarns the mother of a lot of the problems, so she ends up raising a kid who really is an abnormally skilled resistance leader, leading the machine overlord to correctly deduce that removing him from play before the game even got started would be a smart move. 

In the grandfather paradox you never travel back in time to kill Hitler because having killed him you erase your motivation to travel back in time and do it again. 

In the casual loop paradox, you get this chicken and egg aspect, your time travel ends up causing your reason for time travel. 

Skynet decides he has to eliminate John Connor in the past, not now, because he made the resistance so much more dangerous, but the reason for that was because the attempted assassination resulted in him having the foreknowledge and training to be dangerous. 

This is why casual loops are also called Retrocausality, pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, or Self-Fulfilling Prophecies. 

Now we need to talk about Quantum. 

In Quantum Physics there are numerous interpretations of seeming Quantum Randomness. 

The two you’re most familiar with are Copenhagen and Many Worlds. 

We don’t really have a way to test which is true, if any, because they are all designed to match what evidence we do have. 

Copenhagen looks at Schrodinger’s Cat and says the critter is simultaneously alive and dead until you look. 

I prefer to think of it as coin that’s spinning, simultaneously heads and tails, until you grab it, since I like cats. 

Plus I think a spinning coin better represents the concept of an undetermined state. 

In Many Worlds you don’t know the result until you observe it but it assumes the event actually spawned two different realities, one alive, one dead, or one heads, one tails. 

The result is already determined, you can’t predict which universe you’re in but the contents of the box or the coin flip are already resolved you just need to check them. 

Time Travel is mostly not a problem in Many Worlds. 

If you jump back in time you just spawn a new timeline. 

In fact there ought to be a version of reality right now where by sheer quantum randomness various atoms in your front lawn have coalesced into a blue police box some gentleman just stepped out of, complete with detailed but fake memories of time travel. 

That’s the irritating thing about quantum, since any given atom has a finite chance to change into another atom, there is a much smaller chance of two of them doing it at about the same time and place, and a far smaller but still finite chance of that happening in many atoms to produce some macroscopic and weird thing out of nowhere like and individually wrapped candy bar or a person possessing an entirely randomly created memory. 

So in many worlds there’s already a reality in which someone has appeared genuinely thinking they’re a time traveler even though they didn’t even exist till five seconds ago. 

This concept is merely an extension of the notion of a Boltzmann Brain, in a truly random system any state that can exist will eventually exist, and that would include a brain, complete with everything it needs to keep surviving, like a body, assembling itself randomly, and that can also include a fake memory, leading that entity and other people to assume they existed before, a concept we’ll look at from a different angle when we discuss the Simulation Hypothesis. 

But real time travel is nominally viable in Many Worlds anyway, since you wouldn’t even risk a paradox so long as you were jumping to a time, ahead or behind, in a reality that was not your own. 

And it need differ by nothing more than that a single random uranium atom in the core of the planet that did decay into thorium and Helium five seconds ago in our reality did not do so in the one you want to jump ahead in time into. 

Or a version of the past where an atom of uranium still around now had previously decayed as Julies Caesar was born, and events are otherwise effectively identical. 

It’s not your past or future you are messing with so no paradox is created by your actions. 

You need not even necessarily be moving in time anyway, as a parallel reality might simply have time running there a bit slower or faster so you are simply stepping into a place that is otherwise identical but a bit further ahead or behind your own time. 

In many worlds it’s kind of debatable if going to those other worlds is really the same as time travel or not, but from a practical standpoint it is. 

Of course you could still setup a casual loop in this setup too, though it might be better to think of it as a wave. 

You get your hands on a time machine, or reality jumping machine, and wait till the next news report of some big gold strike on relatively cheap land or some other event less random than the lottery, like a new tech patent, and jump a bit back in time into a reality where a copy of you exists waiting for such data too, hand it off to him and he takes off, leaving you there to assimilate into a near-identical circumstance but now very rich due to your knowledge. 

He arrives in the next carbon copy and cuts the same deal with your other quantum clone and rinse and repeat until eventually some difference exists that breaks the chain and the wave crashes to an end. 

This isn’t a casual loop in that chicken and egg sense since you had a definite starting and stopping point. 

Now the Copenhagen Interpretation, that our cat or coin is in two states at once until observed, doesn’t actually prohibit alternate timelines or other realities, it simply has no need for them. 

There’s tons of different ways you can have places besides our own Universe after all, and some of our other FTL concepts for instance would involve popping into a parallel Universe, meaning one that has bits and pieces corresponding to our own, that was smaller than our own or had a higher speed of light and just zipping through there until you reached that point of congruity and popping back into our own Universe. 

But again in Copenhagen there’s no need for these alternate realities, and we often assume there is just a single timeline. 

After all an issue with Many Worlds, an incorrect one but a common concern, is that these branching new realities are all new universes forming from nothing and breaking energy conservation, or getting you something from nothing. 

Which considering our own universe is assumed to have violated that in the first place shouldn’t be a big concern but normally in many worlds, or in some variations of it, the assumption is these alternate universes already existed and always have. 

Think of it as alternate pasts, not just alternate futures. 

More than one state of affairs can lead to an identical final result, a concept that relates to our next concept, and would still apply even though it assumes there are no alternate timelines. 

In the context of Copenhagen Interpretation, with no alternate timelines or realities, or at least where if they do exist they are inaccessible, we have something called the Novikov Self-Consistency Principle. 

Igor Novikov, who came up with the Novikov self-consistency principle of time travel, argued temporal paradoxes weren’t possible. 

He closes out paradoxes in time travel, which are permitted in some solutions of the Einstein Field Equation for General Relativity, by asserting any event that would give rise to a paradox or change the past in anyway must have a probability of zero. 

This doesn’t ban time travel in and of itself though. 

It simply is arguing that any time travel has to result in no paradox or it would be infinitely improbable to occur. 

Novikov is arguing that regardless of whether or not time travel is possible, you will not be able to do anything that causes a paradox. 

In a conceptual sense, don’t think of this as some sort of Time guardian who pops out and stops you, but rather that the moment you take a paradoxical route things would reset to a scenario where you hadn’t taken it yet and keep doing it until you picked a path that didn’t cause that. 

Since in Copenhagen there is always a chance one of the random quantum events will spiral itself up to the macroscopic level one will eventually occur that results in a non-paradoxical action. 

There’s no deletion, our coin that can normally be heads or tails will simply never land on heads if it doing so would cause a paradox. 

You would not remember these resets of course, they will have never happened for the same reason that once you open Schrodinger’s box or catch the coin, the observed reality erases the alternate possibility, and as we discussed with Quantum Entanglement, that erasure is not constrained by the speed of light nor does it even seem to care if it has to reach back in time to fix it. 

Again this isn’t implying anything is selecting that solution that counters the possible paradox, there would be many that did, and many that didn’t, and one would happen same as a drop of water falling from the sky will eventually take a path leading to the ocean, whether it does so by falling right into the ocean, or on your roof and following drainage ditches and waterways to the ocean, or even falling on a desert and evaporating. 

The Self-Consistency Principle tends to bug people a bit as confusing since it sort of seems like a tautology. 

Paradoxes are impossible because paradoxes are impossible, but the difference is that it’s asserting the laws of physics can’t be chucked out the window by time travel. 

There’s a comment on this that this principle seems to permit any type of action can be done through time travel except killing yourself, since you obviously can’t travel back in time if you’re dead. 

I’d say even that doesn’t work though, and something will happen to resurrect you, like one of those freak quantum events I mentioned earlier where a blue police box and guy with fake memories of time travel is spontaneously spewed out by quantum randomness. 

Or someone discovers cloning and mind uploading, something we’ll be talking about in the future. 

Again it’s not that something is stopping specific actions, it’s just that all your possible state and actions will only be non-zero probabilities when they won’t cause a paradox. 

Now Novikov’s views are hardly considered canon, however it comes up a lot in time travel talk so I wanted to discuss it. 

Same reasoning as the Tachyon, although in the tachyon’s case, while it has fallen a bit out of favor in science fiction it has seen a recent in resurgence in all sorts of pseudoscience especially for methods of immortality, and again we’ll be looking at that subject ourselves soon, though we will be mostly focusing on plausible science. 

Next time in this series we’ll be looking at the Alcubierre Warp Drive, taking our first dip into how general relativity allows us to warp spacetime, and another type of exotic matter, particles and fields possessing negative mass or energy. 

From there we will move on to wormholes, which rely on many of those same general relativity concepts and negative mass as well. 

I haven’t decided on an exact order to the next few videos since I want to redo the old Dyson Dilemma video without having to interrupt our regular schedule, but subjects we’ll be looking at in the near future in no particular order will be a return to the Habitable Planets Series for a look at Double Planets, a return to Megastructures series for a quick look at Hoopworlds, neither of which are going to require very long videos so will probably be sooner than later. 

We’ll also be taking a deep look at the Simulation Hypothesis, the concept that we might all be living in a giant simulated Universe, and some of the implications that would have in regard to the Fermi Paradox. 

As well as an introduction to the concept of transhumanism and biological immortality and especially the latter’s implications to the Fermi Paradox. 

If we get a chance we’ll look into the Carter Doomsday Argument and its own implication for the Fermi Paradox, and as you might guess this jump back into the Fermi Paradox is a major motivation for finally redoing the Dyson Dilemma, and if I get a chance the Fermi Paradox Solutions video as well. 

So a busy next couple months, assuming I can hold to the current weekly schedule.

Faster Than Light ep01: Quantum Entanglement
---
  
2016-03-25  
https://youtu.be/2_4l5_G3dnM  

---

So we had a poll on the channel for the next subject and concepts for Faster than Light Travel and communication, FTL, also called superluminal technologies, got selected. 

This turned out to be a problem though because as I began writing up material I found I was quickly surpassing even the record holding videos for duration on this channel, Terraforming Techniques and Solutions to the Fermi Paradox, both of which were surveys of concepts like this was going to be, and I always felt involved a little too much skimming of the material, and the latter comes in at nearly an hour. 

On the other hand I’ve specifically been trying to keep the videos shorter these days, and I just can’t imagine giving this subject a proper treatment in anything less than hour. 

But a number of the concepts don’t require individual treatment and share a lot of common properties. 

So we’re going to break this up into sections and make a new series, like we have for megastructures and habitable planets. 

It also means I can turn out videos on other subjects in between new installments. 

As we go through these we’re going to try to give all a fair treatment. 

Our goal is to familiarize ourselves with these concepts regardless of whether they work, and what we’ll see is that some can be outright dismissed whereas others work but sometimes only because of possible scenarios requiring things like negative or imaginary matter that we’re not sure even exists. 

So today we’ll look at some of the basics of FTL, the misconceptions about the speed of light a lot of people have, and one the currently most popular but also most misunderstood FTL concept, Quantum Entanglement. 

But before launching into that, I want to emphasize that since I usually try to avoid including anything beyond simple algebra in these videos, and try to keep even that to a minimum, while we can do Special Relativity with that, we can’t do General Relativity. 

The Einstein Field Equations, the special solutions to which are what open the door for a lot of these ideas, are simply out of our reach. 

To look at that in any meaningful way you need the full series of calculus, linear algebra, and both ordinary and partial differential equations. 

Even with that, proper explanations take a very long while, more than I’m willing to devote in this video or any other, but if you do have that mathematical background and want to get that deeper understanding, I recommend Leonard Susskind’s 13-part lecture on General Relativity and the video link will take you to that Playlist. 

But we can talk about Special Relativity so let’s refresh on that real quick, we’ll see if I can do it under three minutes. 

Back in the late 1800s we noticed a peculiar property of light. 

Which is that it always moved at the same speed. 

Let’s illustrate this with Earth. 

The sun constantly emits a lots of particles including photons, the particles of light. 

If we have three people standing on the equator of Earth measuring these particles, not including the photons, they will get three different speeds because the planet turns. 

Here at noon, the man is neither getting closer or further away from the sun, so he measures the particles at a certain speed, on average about 400 km/s for the solar wind. 

But the Earth spins around at about half a kilometers a second. 

So this guy near the dawn is heading right toward the sun at half a kilometer a second and should measure those particles averaging about 400.5 km/s. 

His speed combines with their speed, over here near the twilight the guy is flying away from the sun and solar wind particles. 

They need to catch up to him, and the particle speed measured will be 399.5 km/s. 

That’s just good old-fashioned relativity, Galilean Relativity or Galilean Invariance. 

Each of those three people has an inertial frame of reference, which is to say they have a speed and direction, and each will measure any object’s speed and direction differently. 

Same as you aren’t moving when sitting on a bus, but see a guy walking up the aisle of the bus as moving, while someone outside the bus will see you and the guy in the aisle both moving with the addition of the speed of the bus. 

Back to our Earth model, these guys are measuring the incoming particles at different speeds, but now they start measuring light, incoming photons, and something weird happens. 

They all measure it at the same speed. 

Why doesn’t matter yet. 

That was just the state of play at the dawn of the 20th century. 

Light, for whatever reason, always had the same speed when measured. 

That’s not a consequence of Einstein’s Special Relativity, it’s the strange fact he developed the theory to handle. 

He assumed, postulated, only two things. 

That the laws of physics were invariant in all inertial frames, which just means the speed and direction you are moving at doesn’t change the rules of the Universe, and that the speed of light is the same for all observers. 

It does not vary, it is invariant. 

Since speed is simply distance over time, 60 miles, a distance, per hour, a time, if people going different speeds are measuring something and getting it’s speed the same then the Einstein reasoned that these observers had to measuring different distances and times. 

And he further reasoned this effect wasn’t just limited to light but to anything traveling fast, the closer to the speed of light, the more intense the effect, as governed by this equation. 

And we’ve checked this, I don’t think there’s any theory that’s been checked more often and rigorously. 

So if a guy standing on a giant digital space clock measures that clock as a mile long and checks his watch, he’ll see them running at the same speed. 

If a guy flies by at 87% of the speed of light, he’ll see that clock only seems to add a second every other second and the clock will only be half a mile long to him. 

Another guy flying by at 97% of light speed will see the clock running at only a quarter as fast as his watch and will measure the clock as only a quarter mile long. 

All right, refresher complete, intro complete. 

I mentioned misconceptions. 

The first of these is the speed of light itself. 

It really isn’t about light at all, it just happens to be one of the few things that travels at that speed and the one we first discovered. 

Any massless particle, such as the gluons that glue quarks together, moves at the speed of light, and nearly massless particles like neutrinos usually move within spitting distance of it. 

It’s even possible photons themselves have a tiny little bit of mass and actually move just a hair under the speed of light, though of course if that were so we’d have to chuck speed of light as a term. 

But that would be fine, since it’s more accurate to think of this as the maximum speed information can move at, because that’s the actual restraint that matters. 

Nobody’s going to rename it the speed of information, or the maximum propagation rate of cause and effect, but that’s more accurate and more appropriate to what we really want to circumvent anyway. 

We don’t really care if photons get somewhere faster, we care about the signal we are transmitting with those photons. 

And information in this context include objects since a note, or a person, can obviously contain information. 

The second misconception is that if something is some number of light years away, say a hundred, you can’t get there in under a hundred years. 

That isn’t so, you could get there in a second flat if you had enough energy to get really close to light speed. 

When you got there though, while only a second would have passed for you, because of time dilation, their calendar will say it’s a hundred years in the future. 

The third misconception is that relativity says nothing can go faster than light, that’s never been true or claimed. 

It’s trivially simple to move something faster than light and the only reason you can’t easily verify this yourself is that you’d need a strong telescope and a very powerful laser to do it. 

If you stuck a beam on the edge of Mars, and then flicked it as quick as you could across the surface to the other end, someone watching that beam will see it swipe across Mars very quickly and faster than light can travel. 

In this same way, if you moved something in front of a light source you could get its shadow to move faster than light. 

That beam, and that shadow, are things. 

This not a quibble, because it’s important to a lot of misreported violations of light speed. 

Nor is it fringe science or radical thinking, this is universally accepted and mundane science, and it matters because while you can argue the dot and the shadow aren’t real objects, we have a lot of stuff like virtual particles and wave packets that can also do this trick and also have that ethereal status as not exactly real. 

But what matters is that you couldn’t use that to send information faster than light. 

That light dot on Mars will move faster than light but it won’t move when your hand did, it will move when the light from that laser in your hand arrives. 

Same for a shadow, it won’t move until the light you’re blocking, or no longer blocking, arrives. 

Stick something right in front of the sun shadowing Earth and that won’t appear for several minutes. 

And again this is an important distinction because there are other examples of things that move faster than light, or that we have some good cause to think can, and in virtually all of these we can show how you couldn’t use it to transmit meaningful information faster than light. 

But you’ll probably have seen articles in pop-sci publications loudly proclaiming that something does move faster than light and simply assuming you can use that to send information, when in most cases they’ve been outright told by the very person who discovered the item that it does no such thing. 

We see this lot with things involving quantum, which leads us to Quantum Entanglement. 

Since sometimes in the mid 70s to about the turn of the century the Tachyon, which we’ll cover in the future, was the got to particle for science fiction trying to justify their in-story mode of faster than light travel. 

Sometimes in the early 2000s that role got stolen by Quantum Entanglement. 

That’s actually kind of funny since Entanglement has been around as an established idea since the 1930s but tachyons came up as an idea in the 60s. 

Quantum Entanglement, leaving out the math, isn’t too complex. 

Though the feature that tends to be of interest to people in sci-fi for faster than light communication is actually Quantum Non-Locality, what Einstein famously called ‘spooky action at a distance’. 

But Quantum Entanglement is a situation in which two or more particles are connected in terms of their quantum state. 

They are entangled. 

You can’t describe individual parts of the system of two or more particles independently and correctly. 

Distance doesn’t appear to matter for this, and the most common entangled state discussed in this would be two particles being created by some event and flying away. 

So you’ve got two particles flying away from each other, and being quantum thingies that whole Schrodinger’s Cat issue comes into play where you not only don’t know what the properties of that particle are until you measure it but we’re pretty sure it isn’t even determined until you do. 

Now these properties can be anything from spin to charge to momentum and many other but for now I’m going to call these coinons and say they have the property of being either heads or tails, and when made in pairs one must be heads and the other tails. 

What Quantum is telling us is that observing a coinon is equivalent to flipping and catching it, until then its spinning around and doesn’t have a heads state or a tails state, it’s both at once. 

The moment I catch that though the other coinon turns into the opposite. 

I catch a heads and a moment later my lab partner catches the other particle and sees its on tails. 

We’ve checked this tons of times and as best as we can tell it is true, and can only happen if those two coinons are talking to each other somehow. 

And while we haven’t determined yet if this is actually instantaneous we have nailed this chat down as taking place at no less than 10,000 times the speed of light. 

This is actually Quantum Non-Locality, which as the name implies indicates the ability of Quantum things to act in a way which would imply they violate Locality, or basically means they can do things faster than the speed of light, or appear to anyway. 

The coins, pardon, coinons, are entangled, once one is determined the other is determined. 

And it doesn’t have to be just one particle, we’ve done this with larger things like molecules, and hypothetically at least you could do it with a person. 

Now, obviously your first thought is that you can use this for sending information faster than light. 

But you can’t, or at least you can’t by any method we know. 

I think people get hung up on the super-fast motion and figure that must be able to be tapped but remember we already saw to superluminal effects with our Martian Laser Dot and Shadow and we know you can’t send information with either, at least not faster than light, and you can’t with Quantum Entanglement or Non-Locality either. 

Here’s why not, and we will just use coins here. 

I am giving you a coin and your buddy a coin, a magic pair of entangled coins, and I am telling you that no matter how far away you are the moment you flip your coin his will flip to the opposite side yours comes out on. 

But this is a truly random coin, you have to flip it, you can’t just set it on the side you want. 

Remember this a quantum random event, and it has a 50/50 chance to come up heads or tails. 

How do you send a message with that? 

I mean if we could control the coin we could easily send a binary code, heads one, tails zero. 

Too easy. 

All you’re going to generate is random noise though. 

Heck, quantum randomness like this is one of the few safe ways to generate a truly unbreakable one-time pad encryption since there will be no pattern to the result. 

But wait, you can send a message using that coin. 

I don’t need my distant partner to receive heads or tails, I just need him to know I flipped the coin. 

I decide I will flip or not flip the coin once every second, a coin flip, regardless of outcome, it’s a one, and a non-flip is a zero, a simple binary code with a bandwidth of one bit per second. 

Again too easy. 

Our digit are simply motion or non-motion. 

Unfortunately, once again, that doesn’t work. 

Because with quantum particles you have no way of knowing if your particle has or hasn’t been observed when you look at it. 

It works for our magical coin but not for entangled particles. 

I can’t send out a constant beam to distant locations from some central location that they can then use to transmit information superluminally, or have two big boxes full of entangle particles pairs they can check at need to send messages, because the state of each particle isn’t determined until you look at it and you don’t actually know if it’s partner has been looked at unless someone tells you, by old fashioned light speed. 

You can both meet up later, or phone each other, and tell each other which once you looked at and what it was and note that his was opposite yours but you can’t send any information this way. 

This doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll never figure out a trick for using this, since these particles appear to be talking faster than light they presumably use a method that maybe we can use too. 

But for now this method is closed off to us and doesn’t appear to have any way we could use it. 

Next time in the FTL series we’ll take our first look at Exotic Matter and its role in FTL technologies by looking at Tachyons, a hypothetical type of particle that not only goes faster than light but actual goes backward in time, and we’ll discuss the implications and dilemmas of that.

Black Hole Starships
---
  
2016-03-19  
https://youtu.be/x32AkL6HPfc  

---

So today we are looking at using small, artificially created black holes as a way of powering interstellar spaceships and we started on that last week by discussing the properties of micro-black holes and Hawking Radiation. 

If you haven’t seen that video, unless you happen to be very familiar with how Hawking Radiation works, you might want to click the video link on the screen and catch that first. 

Like all the video links on this channel, doing so will just pause this video and open that video in a new window. 

But the thirty second summary of that video is that smaller black holes emit a lot of energy, which we call Hawking Radiation, and the power released by a given black hole roughly scales up inverse-square with its mass. 

Meaning that if you have two black holes, one twice as heavy as the other, the bigger one gives off only a quarter of the power the smaller ones does, and since they are emitting this energy by evaporating their own mass till they run out, the bigger one will live eight times long, since it emits only a quarter the energy and has twice as much mass to fuel that emission. 

Similarly a black of only a tenth of the mass will emit a hundred times the power, but with only a tenth the mass will run of fuel a thousand times quicker. 

I should note that this is just an approximation, not an exact calculation. 

Since the black holes we can detect are so massive they don’t put out enough Hawking Radiation to power a tiny LED light we couldn’t measure their Hawking Radiation if they were even as close as our own Moon, let alone hundreds of light years away. 

So we have only theoretical models and those don’t actually exactly follow the inverse-square mass relationship I just mentioned anyway, and there are competing models. 

So today I’ll specifically be using the values from Westmoreland and Crane’s 2009 paper originally discussing Black Hole Starships, since it is the one you will most likely hear referenced if you decide to do some more personal research on this subject, and a link to that paper is included in the video description below. 

That said, the core concept for the ship then is pretty straight-forward. 

You make a small black hole, one with a mass somewhere between an aircraft carrier and a small fleet of oil supertankers. 

Once you have a black hole of that size you have an object emitting a huge amount of power, the ones we’ll be looking at today emit power somewhere between a percent or so of what the Sun hits the Earth with to several times what the sun hits the Earth with. 

That figure incidentally is usually given as a couple hundred petawatts, and a petawatt is a million gigawatts, where most big nuclear reactors and hydroelectric dams produce about a gigawatt, so Earth’s solar power supply is on an order of a hundred million times larger than our biggest power plants produce and the black holes we’re looking at today produce power comparable to that, millions to billions of times more powerful than our largest power plants. 

I’ve mentioned in the past that the concept of an ‘unarmed spaceship’ is an oxymoron, that the sci-fi staple of an unarmed freighter getting attacked just isn’t plausible, and this is another example of that. 

The sheer power output of any interstellar spaceship is truly immense, and a petawatt is the equivalent power output of 16 Hiroshima nuclear bombs going off every second. 

The ships we’ll be talking about today operate anywhere between 1 petawatt to several thousand petawatts. 

So even the lowest powered of these ships, even if you could only effectively direct 1% of that output as a weapon, could blast a large city into rubble every few minutes, while the higher power versions operating at highest efficiency could effectively wreak havoc as though they had a machine gun that shot Hydrogen bombs. 

That’s without even directly weaponizing a black hole either, which we’ll discuss near the end of the video, that’s simple recognition that if you have that much power you can do a lot of damage. 

Now that power is omnidirectional in its output when emitted, same as a star, and you can generate thrust by putting a mirror up on one side, so light flying out in the wrong direction reflects back in the right direction and the radiation is no longer omnidirectional. 

You can do even better with a parabolic dish. 

That’s your simplest black hole drive, conceptually anyway, a black hole with an attached parabolic dish. 

You stick the rest of your ship on the other side of the dish, and it turns out black holes in around the megaton range with attached ships of similar mass can pull off accelerations and maximum speeds that can get you from one star to a neighboring one is less than a human lifetime and let you wander around solar systems, even the deeper darker outer zones, in timelines of months. 

In the case of Black Hole Ships, the key figure, if things are running very efficiently, is that you get one-gee of acceleration on a one megaton total mass ship for every 3000 petawatts of power you have. 

As huge as the power output sounds, it still isn’t terribly impressive when it comes to shoving things up to the speed of light. 

The table I’m bringing up is an extraction of the calculated power outputs, in petawatts, of various black holes by their mass in megatons that was discussed in Westmoreland and Crane’s 2009 paper. 

I’ve gone ahead and added to that the Power to Mass ratio, as well as what the acceleration, in gees, of a spaceship would be that had equal mass of black hole to the ship and its cargo. 

So a two megaton ship would be half black hole by mass and half ship and cargo. 

Lastly I’ve added in a column for how long it would take for that ship to get to just 1% of light speed. 

Which I picked strictly to be able to avoid relativistic effects, since its minimal at that point. 

At 1% of the speed of light your clocks will lose only a few seconds a day in terms of time dilation and good-old fashioned Newtonian equations for velocity and kinetic energy would only be inaccurate with high precision measurements. 

Now that would imply an obvious preference, you want the lightest black hole since it gives the best acceleration, and sure you don’t want eight-and-a-half gees, but just as we could almost double that acceleration if we could strip the ship mass down to near zero besides the black hole, we can slow it down by adding more mass. 

The problem is, as I’ve mentioned, that small black holes don’t live long and the smaller they are, the shorter their life. 

So the last column is the approximate rounded lifetimes of the black holes as listed in the original paper. 

So unless you can find some way to refuel your black hole, by dumping more mass into it for instance, these smallest black holes won’t last long enough to get you to your destination. 

As they put out energy they lose mass, which causes them to emit energy even faster, and lose mass faster, until eventually they are so small and high powered that they essentially explode. 

So if your black isn’t massive enough to survive your trip you eventually need to jettison it and now you have no power source to slow back down with when you reach your destination. 

Which isn’t necessarily a problem, we discussed in the Interstellar Colonization video some of the tricks you can use to slow a spaceship down without using fuel. 

One of those is the Bussard Ramjet, a concept for a spaceship that ran by magnetically sucking in interstellar hydrogen gas and ramming it down the axis of the ship to produce fusion and thrust. 

This concept turns out not to work because when we could run the calculations better we found that all that gas, which is essentially stationary to interstellar space, would slow the ship down more by being absorbed then it would produce. 

Which was unfortunate but had the silver lining that even though you can’t accelerate with it, you can use it to slow down for free. 

So if you have a short-lived black hole accelerate your ship up to cruising speed you could then slow down at your destination this way, and power yourself during the trip more conventionally with a nuclear reactor, fusion if you have that, or otherwise classic fission, as life support is only a tiny fraction of the energy budget for an interstellar trip at relativistic speeds. 

Of course another possible use of that magnetic ramscoop method might be to suck in matter and jam it into your black hole to refuel it. 

This doesn’t give you infinite acceleration, since eventually you will reach a speed where even the near-total conversion of mass-to-energy by that black hole won’t match the lost momentum of sucking in that relatively slow gas, but it gets you a very high speed and lets you keep your black hole. 

But refueling a black hole is easier said than done and the smaller the black hole, the harder the refueling. 

I mentioned in the last video that refueling a small black hole is much harder than making one in the first place. 

In that we suggested the best way to make one would probably be with tons of lasers all pumping energy into the exact same place at the same time, a place much smaller than the nucleus of an atom. 

This concept is called a Kugelblitz black hole, Kugelblitz just being ‘ball lightning’ in German, since you a making a tiny little ball of light. 

Light, being made of photons, doesn’t have a problem being squeezed together like normal matter does so it’s easier to make black holes out of. 

A kugelbltiz black hole is hard to do simply because it requires immense energy and precision. 

If you try to do it with normal matter instead, like interstellar hydrogen, you are trying to jam materials together to pressures and temperatures far beyond what is necessary for fusion it’s very improbable we’d find a way to do that especially without spending more energy than we put in. 

Same problem, you can’t refuel a black hole on your ship with lasers since you’d burn more energy up making those lasers than you’d get out of it. 

And the smaller the black hole the harder it is to do, with normal matter, since you are trying to squish that matter into an even smaller spot and fighting against even higher power output resisting that matter input. 

The analogy I used last time was that it was like trying to shove a beachball down the nozzle of a firehose that’s turned on. 

Making them, the kugelblitz way, is essentially the process of having a massive swarm of power collectors that fire lasers with high precision at one spot at one moment, allowing you to use a star as a black hole generator for spaceships. 

That requires ludicrous levels of precision and vastly huge solar collectors but that doesn’t appear to break any known laws of physics, refueling with random hydrogen probably does, so midtrip refueling is probably not an option. 

We also have the problem that black holes emit very high powered particles, like gamma rays, making them very hard to reflect the power from, so you can’t just wrap a black hole with a highly reflective material to bounce the emission back in to the black hole to be reabsorbed. 

At this time we lack any materials that acts as good mirrors to gamma radiation. 

If we did have one it would make things a lot easier since you could create a throttle that let you bounce some of the emitted energy back into the black hole, decreasing its net power output and extending its life, when you wanted to do so. 

Also without anything that can reflect gamma radiation you have to absorb all that gamma radiation as it emerges from the black hole and let it heat up a material to just below its melting temperature. 

So you place a sphere, or hemisphere, around the black hole. 

It glows red hot and emits normal light, which can be reflected by a parabolic dish. 

I’ll refer to this as an absorption shell. 

Unfortunately the more power you have, the bigger your absorption shell needs to be. 

Tungsten, the element with the highest known melting temperature, about 3700 Kelvin, can radiate about ten megawatts per square meter without melting. 

Twenty since it can emit from both sides. 

That still means that you need about 50 million square meters of the stuff for every petawatt of power you want to absorb. 

Now the good news is there are some new alloys with even higher melting points than Tungsten, and blackbody radiation goes with the fourth power of temperature in Kelvin, so if we found an alloy that had twice the melting point of Tungsten it could radiate 16 times as much power without melting. 

But even then you’d still need a few square kilometers of absorption shell to handle all that energy. 

Now these are massive ships weighing at least hundreds of thousands of tons if not millions of tons, so you can get away with absorption shells that big, especially since the shell needn’t be terribly thick. 

However that raises yet another problem, and that is how you can keep the black hole tied to the ship. 

The black hole is emitting its energy omnidirectionally, so it’s not accelerating itself at all, and your ship will just fly off leaving the black hole behind. 

You can hardly attach a rope to the black hole since it is smaller than an atom and will flat out shred anything it touches even if it didn’t melt it apart first. 

Now a number of methods are possible, such as giving the black hole an electric charge and binding it to the absorption shell that way. 

The absorption shell can be leashed to the ship conventionally by some struts connecting it to the parabolic dish. 

That may or may not work, but to prove it is possible, the conceptually easiest is just to use the black hole’s own gravity to hold on to the absorption shell while it’s radiation pushes it away. 

This usually known as a gravity tractor, and it’s a lot like the Statites or Shkadov thruster we’ve discussed in the past. 

Something hangs above a radiant object, pushed away by that radiation, but pulled on by its gravity. 

The hard part about doing this with a black hole, a small black hole, is that they don’t actually have that much gravity but do have an awful lot of power output, so getting close enough to the black hole to be gravitationally bound to it means you are sucking up even more radiation. 

Just as an example, for a one megaton black hole, the distance at which it pulls someone with the same force as Earth pulls on you is about an inch. 

Meaning you’d need your absorption shell, and overall the majority of your ships mass, only an inch away to get one gravity of tug on the ship. 

At that distance the power being absorbed would obviously melt any material but even if it didn’t the radiation pressure would fling it away at more than one gee. 

For bigger, longer-lived, lower-powered black holes that radiation pressure drops off a lot and that gravity ramps up a lot, so you could use gravity to leash a bigger black hole for use as a ship drive but there wouldn’t seem much point except maybe for intergalactic travel, because it would simply take way too long to accelerate everything. 

But I offer that just as a way of explaining how you can leash a black hole to a moving object in a way that’s simple to understand and definitely works. 

Ideally, if the technology emerges to reflect gamma rays, and we do have some tricks for doing that which are improving, and if you can feed matter into a black hole, you could set up some particle beams shoving matter into the black hole from behind, and giving it forward momentum and refueling it, then have the gamma reflective material helping cut down on your absorption shell size, or simply letting you discard the absorption shell in favor of just the parabolic reflector dish able to reflect gamma rays. 

That’s probably the key piece of technology to make such a system genuinely viable, we might be able to do without it and still use the concept, but ability to make a material that reflected gamma rays as cleanly as a normal mirror reflects visual light makes this technology vastly less cumbersome. 

If you also had the ability to beam hydrogen you picked up along the way into the black hole, to refuel it and help push it to keep it in place its even easier. 

With such a setup you would have a ship able to get pretty close to the speed of light, do so in a reasonable period of time, and run indefinitely off the fuel just lying around in the interstellar void. 

Your maximum speed with such a setup wouldn’t be infinite, even ignoring the speed of light, since you’d eventually reach a point where the matter you were sucking in was slowing you down by the same amount as the power it produced would speed you up, but that would be quite high. 

If you don’t have those options you really need to use larger sized black holes unable to produce accelerations of one-gee, but even if you did you’d probably never build a ship that produced much more than one-gee of acceleration, that would get uncomfortable for the crew so even if you had a very small and powerful black hole you could refuel and contain you’d probably just have a much larger over all ship. 

The values I gave on the table just assume the total ship and cargo not including the black hole had the same mass as the black hole, to keep it mentally easy, but if you’ve got a black hole that would produce 10 gees of acceleration on its own mass, you could simply have a ship that weighed 10 times as much as the black hole, including the black hole, so that it was 10% of the mass, pushing the ship at one-gee. 

In such a setup the ship is basically a skyscraper with the black hole in the basement, rather than having any rotating sections to provide artificial spin gravity. 

That’s usually our ideal ship for people anyway, one able to accelerate at one gee. 

Without the ability to refuel one and reflect gamma rays you can never have that, and frankly I don’t think black hole powered ships could ever be viable without at least one of those technologies. 

Before we close out let’s talk about two other things. 

First, the impact with SETI, and second the ability to weaponize these things. 

We’ve talked a lot on this channel about the Fermi Paradox, the question of where all the aliens are hanging out, and SETI, the Search for Extraterrestial Intelligence, is the effort to answer that, either by finding them or showing they don’t exist. 

One of the ways we do that is to listen for radio chatter, but the more advanced concepts always involve trying to figure out what technologies they have and how we might see the byproducts of those technologies. 

For instance if the aliens are making Kugelblitz black holes you’d expect to see stars with large solar collector swarms dwarfing planet in sheer area. 

You’d also expect to be able to pick these things up from their gamma radiation or emitted gravitational waves or gravitons if gravitons exist. 

We don’t have detectors at this time hunting for such emissions but they would be one more weapon in the arsenal for SETI hunting. 

Speaking of weapons, there are few obvious ways to weaponize a black hole. 

None of those involve just dumping a black hole onto a planet for it to eat the planet up, I explained why that wouldn’t work in the previous video. 

Your first and simplest one would just be to crash a black hole starship into the target. 

A megaton of relativistic mass would unleash nearly as much power as a star emits in a second when it hit, something akin to a billion h-bombs. 

This isn’t as threatening as you might initially expect since if you saw the ship coming you could vaporize it, and while the black hole would still be there it would just fly right through the planet without doing much damage and continue to sail on till it evaporated. 

Of course when these things do evaporate the unleash quite a lot of energy, somewhere around 10^24 joules in their last second of life. 

And you can control their initial speed and direction when making them so if you can make on the fly and aim it at the right place and time it will explode pretty impressively. 

That’s not a covert and subtle weapon though, since they glow very brightly, especially near the end of their life, but you couldn’t shoot one down either, at best if you could measure its position and speed with great accuracy you might be able to hit it with a beam, just like you were refueling it, and shove it off course. 

If you can’t hit it off course that target is dead unless it can move out of the way in time. 

Of course a ship and probably even a bulky space station probably could see it in time and move, and while these would seriously damage a planet’s surface they aren’t anything like powerful enough to blow up a planet. 

Excellent bunker buster though, since it will sail through anything unimpeded. 

If you’ve got the gamma-ray reflective materials and can refuel the things, implying you could knock one of course, then you can probably also make them on board a ship. 

And you could make very small ones inside what would amount to a missile with a very high acceleration and maneuverability and just cut off the fuel at a time to make it explode when it arrived. 

That would be fairly hard to detect since it would be small and emitting almost all its detectable radiation behind it, where the target can’t see it well. 

So if you’ve got the ability to reflect gamma rays and also feed raw matter into small black holes a black hole missile would be pretty devastating, even if you vaporize the missile, which would have enormous kinetic energy, if the timing on the fuel was done right you’d still get that black hole explosion, and that would be very hard to avoid since the things would be hard to see and highly maneuverable. 

So black hole starships are probably limited to the land of science fiction for a while but show real promise especially if we get a couple fairly plausible technologies down the road. 

Next time we’ll be looking at some stuff that’s more implausible when we look at various concepts for Faster Than Light Travel and Communication.

Micro Black Holes, Virtual Particles, and Hawking Radiation
---
  
2016-03-12  
https://youtu.be/aPgLvRNKpI0  

---

So we used a Youtube poll on the Channel to select the next videos and the first two winners were Black Hole Powered Spaceships and Faster Than Light Travel. 

There’s a lot of overlap in some of those concepts and when I realized I was 20 minutes into the video for the first one before I even mentioned how those spaceships might work, I decided I’d just go ahead and make both of them and this video all part of a set. 

Today I’m explaining the concept of micro black holes, how they differ from regular black holes, and how we might go about making these things. 

To properly discuss that we need to talk about Hawking Radiation, and to do that we need to talk about virtual particles. 

But when we’re talking about black holes we first need to clear away a lot of the misconceptions people tend to get about black holes. 

Which is to say they’re not black and they’re not holes. 

That term, Black Hole, didn’t even come into use till the late 1960’s, on the other hand the notion has been around since well before Einstein discussed the concept in General Relativity. 

They first got discussed way back when the American Revolution was going on. 

A lot of the common features of black holes people reference either are limited to naturally occurring ones made of dead stars or actually describes the tiny condensed matter, probably a point like object of infinite density, inside the black hole called a singularity. 

But a black hole itself is simply any region of space where the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, and we often call that the event horizon because it’s the place where you can’t see events occurring on the other side. 

Nothing that happens on the other side, no event, can be witnessed externally because the light never reaches you from it. 

This does not mean all black holes are dense. 

The monstrously huge ones at the center of many galaxies have an average density less than white dwarfs or neutron stars for instance, and one formed from an entire galaxy’s mass would be nearly a light year across and for all that it contained a trillion stars worth of matter would have an average density on par with the air you and I are breathing. 

Stellar mass black holes are very dense, since they are squeezing in the mass of a whole star to an area a few miles across. 

Smaller black holes are a lot denser than even that, and an Earth-mass black hole would be about the size of a marble and fit comfortably in your hand…. 

At least until it tore you apart and sucked you in. 

But a lot of the black holes we’ll be interested in the next video, to be used as power sources, are way smaller than even that and actually wouldn’t suck you in. 

They simply lack enough mass to yank on you. 

They’re also so small they have problems absorbing matter. 

That’s made worse by Hawking Radiation which we’ll get into later on. 

So if I collapsed an entire small mountain, a billion or so tons of matter, into a black hole, that black hole would be about the size of a proton. 

If we stuck it in a room on a pedestal, you’d be quite safe standing on the other side of the room from it. 

Though when you got to at about arm’s length it would be yanking on you as hard as Earth does. 

Almost all the micro-black holes we’ll be interested in this and the follow up videos will be even less massive than that, and in most cases, if it weren’t for the Hawking radiation they emit, wouldn’t hurt you if you walked right past them. 

That Hawking Radiation does matter though, because as we’ll see in a bit, while your average dead star black hole doesn’t even emit enough energy via Hawking Radiation over a billion years to power a light bulb for a millisecond, smaller ones release a lot of energy and the smaller they are the more they produce. 

This billion ton one we just mentioned releases an amount of power comparable to a nuclear powerplant or major hydroelectric dam. 

So while you could safely stand across the room from it without being dragged in, the power coming off it would burn you to a crisp, since it would about a thousand times more potent than noon time sunlight at the other side of even a fairly large room. 

Before we get into Hawking Radiation and Virtual Particles we have to talk about gravity gradients and tidal forces. 

You’ve probably heard that you fall towards a black hole you’d be torn to shreds, the official scientific name of this is Spaghettification. 

Because you get stretched out thin then ripped apart. 

Personally I don’t like this being mentioned in regard to black holes because it gives some weird notions and feeds into misconception that black holes are incredibly dangerous compared to normal stars. 

A stellar mass black hole wouldn’t shred you till you got way closer to than its original parent star would have torched you into atomic dust at. 

In fact you need to be closer than a planet distance, and if you fell toward Earth you’d get burned up and hit the ground way before you’d get to the tidal tearing distance of most stellar mass black holes. 

Now they all have a distance that would shred you, assuming they have a singularity or a near-singularity in their middle anyway, but for galactic central black holes it is way after you’ve already fallen into the event horizon and for micro black holes it’s at a distance less than most atoms are wide. 

The cause for this is the same in all cases. 

Gravity is an inverse-square force, get twice as far away and gravity is at a quarter of its strength, get half as close and it’s four times more powerful. 

Any object is going to experience slightly less gravity on its bottom than its top, gravity is just a bit weaker up there. 

On planets that’s as far as it goes, because the mass is all spread out so that even if you drilled down deeper into the earth gravity doesn’t get stronger, in fact at the center of the Earth, there’s no gravity at all, because all the matter is symmetrically spread around you canceling out, not working together like when you’re outside of it. 

Black holes are all concentrated so you can get very close, to distance where your head might be twice as far from the center as your feet, and would thus experience one fourth the pull of gravity as your feet. 

And if you’re near a normal black hole that gravitational difference might be only a fraction of a percent but it’s a fraction of a percent of millions times more gravity than you experience on Earth, so it would stretch you and rip you apart. 

This tidal force, this gravity gradient, is very important in smaller black holes because it means that over a very small distance, distances the size of atoms or smaller, that difference in gravity might be truly massive, while in larger black holes for all that they have a lot of gravity, the difference in it at only an atom width further away aren’t that large out above the event horizon. 

Remember that because we’ll come back to it, smaller black holes can have tidal forces, above their event horizons, so severe that they could rip an electron off an atom simply because it was slightly closer. 

So let’s talk about Virtual Particles. 

At the core of physics, especially in Quantum Mechanics, there’s a bit of conundrum with how attractive forces work. 

If you’ve got two positive charges, like repels like, and we envision this as both spitting out photons that hit each other and shove each other further away. 

That doesn’t work too well with attraction, normally if you chuck a baseball at someone it shoves them further away, it doesn’t drag them closer. 

So in Quantum Field Theory we fix this with something called a Virtual Particle. 

Particles that don’t have to follow the normal rules like having positive mass, positive momentum, positive energy, obeying the speed of light, or moving forward in time. 

Now while these particles are literally pulled from nowhere, the concept isn’t. 

The keystone of Quantum Mechanics is the uncertainty principle, that holds that when you get down to really small scales, certain complimentary variables, like position and momentum, or energy and time, can only be simultaneously measured with so much accuracy. 

Conceptually it’s sort of like fractions of penny, if something costs 99 cents and there’s a 6% sales tax, you pay a $1.05, though 106% of 99 is actually 104.94, that 6 hundredths of penny got rounded up. 

The Universe is a bit like that too, it can’t keep track of fractions of a cent, and the amount it can’t keep track of, it’s fraction of penny, is Planck’s Constant. 

We see this in effect too, a lot of particles that mediate forces, like the W and Z bosons that regulate the Weak Nuclear Force, are actually way more massive than the particle that emits them, and this force has an incredibly short range because that amount of mass and energy can only exist out of nowhere like that for a very short period of time, so these particles can’t travel far before disappearing. 

Giving the Weak Nuclear Force a very short range. 

For virtual particles, they come into existence, the theory goes, in pairs right out of nothing. 

We call this the Quantum Foam these days. 

If you’ve hear references to Vacuum Energy, or Zero Point Energy, or weirdness with the Casimir Effect and wormholes, this is what that originates from. 

And we’ve measured the Casimir Effect in labs, so again this idea isn’t coming out of nowhere, even though it is based on the idea of things popping out of nowhere. 

So the virtual particles appear in pairs out of nowhere. 

These are opposite particles of each other, akin to anti-matter, they pop up right next to each other and almost always near instantly recombine and annihilate. 

Virtual particles don’t have to have the same energy or mass as their real equivalents, since the uncertainty principle permits them to vary off the expected normal amounts quite a lot. 

This normal, what particles have when we graph their energy, mass, and momentum in terms of classical mechanics, forms a hyperboloid that looks a bit like a shell, so we call normal matter as being ‘on shell’ or ‘on mass shell’, and virtual particles can be off mass shell, and conceptually how far you are off shell is sort of a measure of how unreal a particle is and how short its existence. 

Though there are way for virtual particles to become real and the divide between real and virtual particles can be a bit blurry and arbitrary in some cases. 

In other ways of looking at virtual particles, they don’t so much exist in space and time as they occupy the moment between ticks of the clock or cracks between flagstones. 

I like that analogy personally since they are basically the mortar holding the bricks of matter together. 

Non-virtual, real matter that has these properties like negative mass or energy is generally what is being referred to when we talk about Exotic Matter, which will be a big component of a lot of the various ideas we will talk about in the Faster than Light Video in a couple episodes. 

Incidentally quite a few of the notions kicked around for where all matter and energy of the big bang came from often revolve around Virtual Particles or parallel concepts from String Theory, a sort of notion of the whole Universe being a big Vacuum Fluctuation. 

There’s not much evidence of this, but there’s not much evidence of anything else from that event either and as Ex Nihilo theories go, those tend to be some of the more interesting. 

But the basic theory dealing with Quantum Foam holds that virtual particles are constantly popping up in pairs everywhere, pairs that almost immediately negate each other out. 

Now we get to Hawking Radiation, because as I mentioned earlier, on very small black holes the tidal forces right near the event horizon can be so strong that a pair of particles right next to each other, but with the one just a tiny sliver of distance further away, might be ripped apart by the difference in forces. 

Now normally, just above a black hole event horizon, just like everywhere else, pair production of virtual particles is constantly going on. 

Sometimes both will escape, sometimes both will fall in, and the nothing important has happened, literally nothing has actually happened. 

But everyone so often one virtual particle will fall into the black hole and the other will fly away, separated by an event horizon they can’t recombine or talk and the black hole will lose just a little mass or energy, same difference in this context, as that one virtual particle flies away and becomes real. 

Normally a photon, a big gamma one, but it can be other particles too. 

This doesn’t happen much. 

Around the big black holes this happens almost never. 

Even though there’s a lot more real estate right over the event horizon of a bigger black hole, and way more virtual particle pairs being produced. 

Around the smaller ones though, right over their event horizons, the difference in forces over even sub-atomic distance can be massive, massive enough to yank those two particles apart and pull one under the horizon, and to do this quite regularly. 

This makes the black hole emit energy, which we call Hawking Radiation since it was Stephen Hawking who figured this out in 1976, and we call this process black hole evaporation, as it means that unless a black hole is absorbing replacement matter they will eventually shrink in size, and will keep shrinking even faster. 

So while a stellar mass black hole might let one virtual photon fly free and become real every couple years, and thus take tens of millions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of trillions of years to evaporate… a smaller one like that billion ton mountain-mass one we looked at earlier, should emit a few hundred megawatts of power constantly for a mere couple trillions years. 

A flyspeck of time to evaporate, just a couple hundred time longer than the Universe has already existed. 

And a few hundred megawatts is a pretty nice power supply, comparable to most nuclear reactors. 

Very loosely, black hole power output by Hawking Radiation scales up with the inverse square of its mass, meaning if cut the black hole’s mass in half we expect to get four times the power, it would also mean it only lived on eighth the time since it’s losing mass-energy four times as fast and only has half as much to burn in the first place. 

So if you wanted a black hole power source that would just outlive our sun, it would only mass about 100 million tons, a hundred megatons, the mass of a decent sized hill, and would pump out about 30 billion watts of power continuously for the next four billion years. 

That’s a lot of juice, about enough for ten million people by modern US electrical consumption, and a hundred megatons isn’t that much mass, I mean it is a lot, in terms of water that would be enough to fill a stadium to the brim several dozen times, but the oceans hold over a billion megatons of water, and the planet itself masses about 6 quadrillion megatons so in the grand scope of things it ain’t that much mass. 

Now while that is a lot of juice and not that much mass, it’s still way too little power for way too much mass to make a good spaceship, so when we talk about black hole powered spaceships in the next video we will be looking at ones closer to the one megaton range. 

For mostly stationary things, at least in interstellar terms, like space stations and planets, these Hill Mass Black holes are where it’s at. 

They can last millions or billions of years and produce more power than an equal mass of solar panels or wind turbines or other things that don’t use limited supply fuels like petroleum or uranium. 

And they take up a lot less room than fields of solar panels or wind turbines since they smaller than a proton. 

Which also means if you built one on the Earth it would just fall right down… and then back out the other side of the planet and back up in 80 minutes. 

I mean it’s way smaller than an atom and yet would still be carrying all the inertia of a freefalling asteroid, it won’t run into much friction from collision. 

It will just oscillate back and force every 80 minutes scorching a nice line along the way. 

That’s one of the reason why we don’t worry much about accidentally making black holes in the lab, even if we made one it would have way less mass than a hundred megatons, we’d be talking grain of sand levels of mass, and lifetimes so short we can only talk about them in scientific notation, so it would just flash right out of existence but even if it didn’t it would just harmlessly oscillate through the planet every 80 minutes, though you’ll often see that listed as 84 minutes. 

The time it takes for something to fall down and through an object to its other side and back again, if it’s not slamming into things, like if you drilled a frictionless vacuum tunnel right through the planet is based entirely on the density of that planet, not its size. 

That’s at the core of the concept called a gravity train, one of the subscribers was asking about it recently and it was in that Total Recall Movie, the remake not the original, which personally I liked even if it wasn’t as good as the original. 

Normally we use gravity train concepts for skimming brachistochrone curves between two cities on the same continent, rather than passing through a planet’s molten core, basically you’d fall down a frictionless vacuum tunnel between say New York and Cleveland, using no power. 

Which is an unrelated but fun concept we might look at down the road. 

There are some tricks to keep black holes from plummeting but the easiest would probably be just to make the thing up in geostationary orbit then beam the power down. 

I know I generally disdain beaming power, since a power beam able to supply electricity for ten million people is also known as a death ray, especially considering Hawking radiation is normal hard gamma, but it deserves mention. 

I will talk about weaponizing micro-black holes a bit in the next video but we’ll skip that for now. 

I get asked fairly frequently to do videos on superweapons, which is an interesting collection of options, but if my supervillain vibe gets any stronger I’m going to have to start picking out a location for my lair so that’s on the back burner. 

Besides I already did a Top 10 video of ways to wipe out a planet’s population last year. 

You’d get around the gamma radiation by wrapping the black hole in something that was a good absorber and had a high melting temperature, like Tungsten, which for our 30 Gigawatt Hill Mass black hole would mean a spherical shell of Tungsten a couple hundred feet across that would be glowing red hot. 

You could then trap that power with solar panels or just leach the heat off it classically to boil water and turn turbines. 

Though the latter is a pretty counterintuitive setup in zero-gravity. 

Now making black holes is also a problem, not as bad as refueling them so they don’t explode, which we’ll talk about in the next video since the ones for spaceships tend to have lifetimes where you’d actually need to worry about them exploding, but it is still quite a technical hurdle. 

It doesn’t appear to be physics hurdle though, as best as we can tell there isn’t a specific problem making small black holes that violates some known law of physics though that’s always hard to be sure of since we don’t know much about black holes definitively yet and there’s still debate about if black holes themselves might violate the laws of physics. 

For very big ones its conceptually easy, cram a lot of matter together, bingo, black hole. 

But matter doesn’t like to be crammed together and for smaller ones you don’t even have gravity helping you pack it in tight. 

So the popular theoretical methods is to blast lasers together since photons are bosons and unlike fermions… which is pretty much everything you think of as normal matter, they don’t care if you jam them together. 

Photons are incorporeal as it were, all bosons are, any number of them can occupy the exact same place at the same time, though space and time start getting a bit inaccurate as concepts at that scale. 

You can read up about that under the Pauli Exclusion Principle if you want more details. 

So if you fired a bunch of photons all aimed at the same place to arrive at the same time, and you packed enough energy into that spot to form a black hole, you’ve got one. 

Normally you’d do this with gamma radiation, since it has a way smaller wavelength which is important when you’re trying to target a spot smaller than an atomic nuclei. 

Now doing this would require some amazing precision, and a big initial power supply though you could draw that out by bouncing the stuff around mirrors or similar. 

You could also control the initial conditions of the black hole if your accuracy is good, giving it the spin, or lack of spin, you want, as well as an initial velocity of the direction and speed you want. 

Incidentally, doing it this way means your black hole is not a power source, it’s a battery, since you are feeding all the energy into it from some massive solar array, fortunately the sun puts out a billion times more power than hits Earth and if you were using all that power just manufacture the 100 Megaton Hill Mass black holes we’ve been discussing, which by good old E=mc2 have just under 10^28 joules of Energy in them, you could manufacture a new one a couple times a minute using the total solar output. 

And it might be a battery in this context but since you could control its initial velocity, and they are capable providing significant thrust by themselves, that’s what the whole next video is about, these black hole batteries are very handy things for powering anything decently far from the sun or that’s compact. 

Alternatively a fusion reactor isn’t a battery, which is why I often talk about future power sources and just talk about them. 

But in the context of batteries, or fuel for ships, they seriously surpass fusion and are potentially way lower maintenance too. 

I talked about making small fake suns that orbited their planets geocentrically in the Shell Worlds and Disc Worlds video and these are sort of ideal for that task since you just build one, or a collection of black holes, of the right power output and lifetime, stick a shell around them of something with a high melting point, and dump it into a 24 hour orbit around the fake planet. 

Real quickly, refueling black holes, small black holes anyway, is harder than making them because dumping matter into an object that is smaller than an atom and spraying out gigawatts of power is sort of like trying to throw beach ball into the nozzle of a firehose that’s turned on. 

We’ll talk about that more next time but I think we’ve reached a good place to end for now. 

Next time, black holed powered starships, which is going to be a bit more sci-fi focused, and after that we’ll talk about theories for faster than light travel and communication, which is also going to be pretty sci-fi oriented, though as always we’ll keep it as close to hard science as possible.

Megastructures 06: Discworlds
---
  
2016-03-04  
https://youtu.be/U2bc7kZcpmQ  

---

So today we’re going to be discussing Flat Earths, disc-shaped artificial worlds, Alderson Discs, and the general notion of how gravity, lighting, seasons, and orbit around these things would work. 

The last video in the series, Shellworlds, involved a type of megastructure we don’t see too much of in fiction, discworlds on the other hand are incredibly common. 

Probably the best known example would be the late Sir Terry Pratchett’s massive fantasy parody series appropriately named Discworld which ended at nearly half a hundred books and over 70 million sold. 

He died a year back so this video is something of a tribute to one of my favorite authors on the anniversary of his death and I’d strongly recommend him to others. 

The concept of a discworld itself requires little introduction, but Flat Earths come in a lot of styles and I wanted to give these a deeper look than they tend to get when looked at as seeming impossibilities. 

So for the rest of the video we will all be honorary members of the Flat Earth Society and we’ll even look at their model because while it is flat out wrong, pardon the pun, it is surprisingly well constructed. 

What we won’t be looking at is Pratchett’s specific discworld, a flat disc on top of the backs of four giant elephants standing on a colossal turtle since much like the weather patterns from George R.R. Martin’s Game of Thrones it was never meant to have a natural and physically possible explanation. 

Now the usual image someone gets of a Flat Earth is a square or rectangle, something you could sail of the edge of and has four corners, but while that is also possible the actual concept has normally revolved around a disc shape. 

We’re pretty used to seeing Mercator Projection maps but an Azimuthal Equidistant Projection is also pretty popular, it’s what we use for the United Nations logo, and it fits on disc just fine. 

As you can see, there is no way to sail off the edge of such a thing. 

You can fly all the way around the world east to west on a circle with your compass always pointing north. 

If you go south toward the edge you eventually hit an impassable frozen landscape of Antartica, not that you’d fall off anyway, you’d just curve around the rim to the other side. 

Interestingly while most images of flat worlds have a sun that circles around the planet the version put forward by the Flat Earth Society has a sun thirty miles across that circles over the Earth, and that’s not quite as ridiculous as it initially sounds since light has pressure. 

We’ve talked about moving stars with their own emitted light or propelling spaceships with laser beams using that light force, and to keep an object hovering in a gravity field you need to provide it the same force, but in the opposite direction, that gravity exerts. 

That translates as a bit over a billion watts per ton of sun, and the sun hits us with about a hundred million times that light, so a thirty mile diameter sun weighing about a hundred million tons would be quite capable of hovering over the earth and could circle above it just by tilting itself a bit to change its direction of thrust. 

This actually works a lot better than a sun circling the planet so if you’re building fake suns that basically giant light bulbs it might make more sense to just go with a cocked light bulb tethered by its power cord to the north pole and pushing up and slightly rimward. 

We’ll come back to discussing gravity and orbits in a little while but first let’s review the lighting system. 

If we built a flat planet, shaped like a coin, around a normal sun, then we could spin it to produce day and night just like on Earth. 

This does give us our first limitation on size though since you can only get so big before centrifugal forces at the rim would exceed gravity and throw you off. 

You can have seasons, like on Earth, by giving it an axial tilt. 

What you can’t have is temperature variation based on being north or south. 

Tilted or not, every bit of the planet gets the same amount of light. 

It isn’t Earth’s axial tilt that makes the poles cold. 

It’s that they are steeply angled compared to the sun. 

If you take a piece of paper and start it off perpendicular to a light, it’s intercepting the maximum amount of light, as we turn it away to be angled it intercepts less and less light until its parallel and intercepts none at all. 

But its total surface remains the same, so that’s less light per square foot. 

Less light, less warmth, so its colder. 

So a flat disc can be angled to have seasons, but the whole thing experiences the same temperature since then entire disk is at the same angle to the sun. 

At least when the sun is an actual normal old star not some fake approximation. 

This brings up the Alderson Disk, which is a hypothetical megastructure that’s a big flat disc around a star, one with a surface area comparable to a Dyson Sphere, more than a billion times what Earth has, which makes it an attractive idea. 

This thing is actually a very silly megastructure in and of itself because it gets virtually no light. 

Even less than you might expect since it also has a giant rim wall to prevent air leaking into the sun. 

It’s also got the problem that it should want to contract into itself and no known material would be strong enough to be able to stop that. 

Some versions of these just hand wave the sun bobbing up and down in the middle to better light the disc, how this is accomplished is unknown since stars don’t generally bob up and down and they certainly do not do this around absolutely nothing at a pace sufficient to do it once a day and at a steep enough angle to matter. 

So that’s where Alderson Disks tend to get abandoned but that is selling the notion rather short. 

We’ll get to the work around for disk’s crunching up, and of not having gravity point straight down, in a little bit. 

Let’s light up an Alderson Disk. 

I mentioned a bit ago how an artificial sun might hold itself up just by its own radiation acting like a thruster, but this is even easier around a star using mirrors. 

There is a device known as a Statite. 

This is a highly reflective and thin satellite which does not orbit, or does not orbit normally, but instead simply hovers in place by reflecting sunlight away. 

We’re already talking about building one giant thick disk around a sun, a couple thin ones is a minor matter. 

Incidentally with statites distance is not a factor. 

While the force holding them up is dependent on the total light hitting them, which falls off as the inverse square of distance, the gravitational force pulling on them also falls off as the inverse square of distance so two identical statites will both hover the same even if one is far further away than the other. 

The key variable two how thick a statites needs to be to hover, or it’s mass per unit of cross section, so it doesn’t fall or fly off, is how bright a star is compared to how massive it is. 

Bigger stars actually produce far more light per unit of mass than small ones, that’s why giant stars don’t live very long, so ironically you can build thicker statites around more massive stars. 

So you can hover thin disks, one or a collection of them, over the sun, to reflect light over the whole disk. 

You can give them curvature and angles to produce bands of day and night and even twilight, and either have them spin or have the disk spin to give days and even season by having the statites mirrors not be of uniform width or reflectivity. 

So that’s the lighting issue solved, and it’s actually an amazingly easy fix. 

Now let’s talk about the gravity generated by disks in general. 

Like most things if you’re far enough away you can treat it as a point like object, and if you’re circle around the rim it still acts fairly normally. 

Our issue is above it, or below it, but fairly close to it. 

If you’re at the very center the gravity acts perpendicular to the surface, so everything is fine. 

But as you get out from the middle the direction of gravity is going to start tilting at an angle. 

By the time you reach the rim its pointing almost entirely toward the middle, that’s why you can’t fall off the edge, you’d just walk around. 

If you took a flat disk, rectangle, cylinder or cube and poured water onto it its gravity would make it lump up into the cap of a rough sphere around the middle. 

And that’s a bit of problem unless you want great big oceans in the middle and land all around the rim. 

Also your air will do the same thing which becomes more than a landscaping concern. 

So what is the work around for that? 

What about the whole problem of the disc crunching together into a sphere? 

We can get around the crunching with centrifugal force, by spinning the disc, which helps us with gravity too. 

The further from the center you are, the more centrifugal force acts on you pushing you outwards. 

To a certain point you can spin your disk to counteract the crunching force of gravity trying to make it a sphere and making water, air, and people tend to migrate to the center. 

But this is an overly simple and non-ideal solution. 

First off, these models of disks always assume the structure is homogenous in density, that makes sense since if you had denser parts they’d just fall toward the middle and that would exacerbate the gravitational tilt to the center. 

Relatively large disks couldn’t be made of rigid materials able to avoid doing that either. 

But if you’ve been following the megastructures series a couple workarounds should be occurring to you by now. 

We’ve talked a lot in this series about active support structures, in the very first episode we talked about orbital rings, in the third we talked about space fountains, and we revisited both concepts last time in Shellworlds video. 

You may want to review those if that’s new to you but the summary version that if you’ve got a stream of matter orbiting a planet, or a star, inside a pipe, you can keep that pipe stationary and rigid so long is it, and anything sitting on it, has a combined momentum with the orbiting particles equal to what the whole sum ought to have if orbiting normal. 

You speed up those particles as you add more weight to your stationary structure, which would normally be magnetically levitating over the matter stream. 

Ditto you can have atlas-like pillars holding things up by just firing mass up a long narrow straight tube to be magnetically slowed near the top, transferring their momentum to whatever you’ve got hovering at the top. 

In this way you could keep two huge objects separate without them needing to orbit each other, and the only energy loss would be on how inefficient your mechanisms were. 

If they were 100% efficient you’d never need to add anymore energy after the first influx to get it going. 

We can use both of these structures, orbital rings and space fountains, in construction of super large discs. 

Let’s say we started with a big orbital ring around a sun, for an alderson disc, or small fat cylinder for a normal discworld, it could be touching for the latter. 

Only this ring segment is hollow and its full of mass spinning around in orbit. 

We pack so much mass into this that it’s a little denser the core. 

The orbiting material keep the segment rigid and also provides gravity above it. 

Then we put another ring in, touching the first, where the mass is denser. 

And another, and another. 

We make the disc as thick as necessary to ensure we can pack all the requisite matter into that last layer. 

Since these outer rings have way more matter in them, in terms of being denser, this negates out that inward pull to the center, and you can even add in some centrifugal force to make that a bit easier. 

Now you can either just use the sides of these rings as your firmament to build on or throw over a skin which keeps from crushing together by using those space fountains, those atlas pillars. 

Bingo, nice even gravitating disc. 

In the case of the giant Alderson Disc we still need that airwall to keep air from sliding into the sun but that’s fine, we just make that a huge solar panel to carry energy out to keep all the other mass spinning. 

Whatever you’re using as your filler material, the stuff running through those pipes, is something you’re going to need a lot of since its generating your gravity too, but as we discussed in the Shellworlds video the universe has tons of hydrogen and helium which aren’t things you’d normally build Earth-like planets out of, but cramming it into these orbital rings to generate gravity is just as doable as using it for stuffing in Shellworlds. 

You don’t necessarily need to use the orbital rings approach either, if you want something weird like a rectangle instead of a circular disc. 

You just make very long space fountains radiating out from the middle holding everything apart and pack the innards with rigid pockets of matter of the right density, presumably hollow rigid objects full of gas. 

You can also make the disc wider as you get further out if you’re having problems getting the necessary density in those outer layers to keep the gravity high enough but I dislike that since it isn’t a flat earth anymore. 

You can also add in walls, probably stylized as circular mountain ranges, to help hold in air and water if you’re not quite pulling off nice even gravity and those same space fountains holding it apart can also be used for bulk matter transport to help deal with issues of slow drift or erosion. 

Now how dense these things have to be is another matter. 

Actually it doesn’t matter, so long as the disc is significantly thinner than it is wide. 

For an infinite plane of mass gravity doesn’t drop as you get farther above or below it and so it doesn’t matter how thick it is, just how much stuff is in there, it can be thick but not dense or dense and thin, all that matters is how much mass is under a given area of the surface. 

So long as your discworld is thin enough compared to your diameter, and your distance above it is much smaller than that diameter, it doesn’t matter if you’re packing your discworld with super-dense neutronium or pressurized hydrogen and helium. 

But if you’re making something with a living area comparable to Earth you do need it pretty dense, a couple thousand miles thick of something at least as dense as steel would do, but denser is better because you really want to keep your discs significant thinner than their diameter. 

For something as big as an Alderson disc it would still be paper thin compared to its diameter even if you let it be a hundred thousand miles thick, and that makes it a lot easier to fill it with pressurized gases for gravity and having higher pressure, higher density ones near the exterior to even out your gravity. 

Needless to say if you’ve got artificial gravity you can skip all this, and artificial gravity isn’t definitely off the radar of future technologies. 

We still don’t know if gravity and electromagnetic forces unify, that’s that whole grand unified theory you sometimes hear about is… …but if they do unify it is conceivably possible you might be able to make a gravity generator that runs off electricity, or an electric generator that runs on gravity, the same as we can whack something with photons and knock out electrons or vice-versa, producing gravitons instead. 

Even if that’s possible it might easily require way more effort than just using bulk matter anyway, but it might be possible and it would seriously simplify things. 

Getting back to the lighting and seasons issues before we close out, we first have to decide how we’re getting our light and how big our disk is. 

For the Alderson Disk that’s just a sun with mirrors hanging overhead. 

In the Flat Earth Society model it’s a disc or sphere around thirty miles across and so is the moon, I’m not too sure how eclipses work in that model though, they use something called a Shadow Object that orbits the Sun I think. 

Like I said I find it rather fascinating how intricate that model actually is but its still nonsense. 

I’d probably do it by having both as discs that occasionally pass each other directly sometimes above or below the other to do lunar or solar eclipses. 

In my version the sun and moon are thin lightbulbs keeping a float by their own radiation pressure, like a big rocket thruster connected to a big leash of a power cord keeping it circular around the pole, where you can maybe wind the cord back or out to help simulate seasons or just lower the power a little when you want it colder. 

If you want a sun actually orbiting the planet geocentrically then you need the sun placed at a distance that results in a 24 hour orbit of the disc. 

That won’t quite be a circle since it is a disc not a sphere but you aren’t necessarily limited to normal Newtonian Mechanics here either since that’s obviously not a real sun. 

I don’t think there’s any disc size you could produce that would have a disc significantly more massive than a star, still have regular Earth gravity, and still have orbits around it of less than a day that weren’t either passing through the disc or so close as to burn it. 

If you’re not using a regular star, either because it’s got its own refuelable fusion reactor or a black hole or something in it then you don’t really need to worry much about normal orbital mechanics because the output of power would be so high compared to the mass of the fake sun, compared to normal suns, that it would basically be a spaceship quite capable of charting any path it felt like. 

Sort of like Apollo or Helios or Ra or whichever sun god riding around on their chariot or solar boat you prefer. 

In fact, as we’ll talk about in the next video on black hole powered ships, the mass of a black hole big enough to light a whole planet – or rather small enough since less massive smaller black holes actually radiate more energy, you’d only need a sun of about a hundred thousand tons, about as much as an aircraft carrier, to illuminate a whole planet and about that same mass of fuel every year so there’s a lot to be said for a big spaceship sun just flying around the disc planet once a day, either doing a whole circle or just having two, one for each side of the planet, landing at the rims. 

Depending on how high you are over the planet the path you take is going to make some areas more brightly lit then others and so hot and cold respectively and you can vary your path and distance to produce seasons or keep to regular path but have the world spin once a year. 

Using a regular star, as I mentioned earlier, doesn’t let you have cold areas near the poles, you can still have axial tilt give you seasons but it will be just as warm everywhere. 

Amusingly you could have disc after disc form a bracelet around a star in a ring and run big circle around to their poles as a train between worlds, or a big topopolis like we discussed at the end of the rotating habitats video, so the Alderson Disc isn’t the only option for one essentially super large land mass you could navigate around without needing a space ship. 

That’s how you build one, big or small. 

Now the real issue is why you’d build one and while we could rationalize making Shellworlds instead of rotating habitats, discworlds are a bit harder. 

They are not as mass efficient as a Shellworld, spheres are more efficient than discs in terms of the amount of matter you need inside to get gravity over your living area. 

In both you can use multiple layers so long as you provide artificial lighting to lower layers and can get rid of your waste heat. 

Discworlds just aren’t as much like Earth as a Shellworld is and also aren’t quite as mass efficient as a Shellworld, which is already an incredibly inefficient use of mass. 

So Discworlds probably are stuck in the category of impractical megastructures, but not so bad compared to Shellworlds that if you’re building lots of those you’d never contemplate building a Disk. 

It’s probably going to be a while before we revisit the megastructures series so I’m not going to pick a subject for the next episode yet. 

Besides Youtube just created this fun polling system and as mentioned next time we’ll be talking about black hole powered ships and some general use of black holes as power sources, since that is what the first poll overwhelmingly favored. 

I like this system so from now at the end of videos instead of just announcing the next video and playing the credits and some music and popping up the channel’s playlists I’m going to star adding a poll for the next, next video after that and asking for suggested topics down in the comments section. 

I’ll sort through those suggestions and see what seems like good topics I can do justice to and throw them up into the next poll. 

Most of the viewers for a given video will probably be after that poll is concluded so if you don’t see it popping up then I probably took it down already. 

If it’s up, please take a moment to weigh in on what topics we should look at next. 

As always comments and questions are welcome below, I try to get to as many as I can.

Megastructures 05 Shellworlds

2016-02-27  
https://youtu.be/TfMr_XkWcEs

Last time in the Megastructures Series we looked at building artificial worlds whose gravity was supplied by rotating them. 

Today we’re going to look at building ones which have their gravity supplied normally, by sheer mass. 

Now building a planet is obviously a pretty serious endeavor and uses up a lot of material, but in of itself it’s not high tech. 

Like a lot of these it’s really more of resource intensive affair. 

Here on Earth, for every square foot of land there’s about a megaton of rock and magma underneath you, for a rotating habitat, even a pretty elaborate and bulky one, a couple tons a square foot works. 

So artificial planets of this variety are usually considered impractical, but they are a lot more appealing to a lot of people so today we’re going to talk about a variation of this concept that is a bit more practical, Shellworlds. 

The concept behind a Shellworld is that you don’t need to make the whole thing out of rock and metal, which are rare compared to other things like hydrogen and helium. 

Done as a thin skin of rock and water and air around some filler material, a Shellworld wouldn’t use anymore material than a rotating habitat except for the filler, which could be hydrogen or helium in a low tech version, or could be stuff like artificial black holes or dark matter, which we’ll get to in a bit. 

The other advantage of ShellWorlds is they let you build your artificial planets at different sizes and still have Earth-normal gravity. 

You can tailor the gravity to be higher or lower than Earth’s own but the real appeal of the ShellWorld is that you can replicate Earth for all practical purposes. 

So let’s start with a quick look at gravity. 

When you’re outside a spherical object the gravity on you is linear to its total mass and inverse-square to its radius. 

Which is to say if you double the mass, you double that force, triple the mass, triple the force. 

Alternatively double your distance and the force falls to a quarter, triple it and it drops to a ninth, get ten times further away and it’s just 1%. 

But if you just scale up something like Earth, doubling its radius, you won’t have the same gravity at the surface. 

Volume rises with the cube, so it’s got 2-cubed or eight times the mass and so eight times the gravitational force, but the distance has also risen by double, so the force drops to a quarter. 

Eight divided by four is two, so this scaled up Earth has twice the surface gravity. 

We don’t want that, so the fix would be to use a filler that was half as dense, so it had half the mass. 

Similarly if you wanted a planet half the size of Earth but with the same gravity you’d need a filler that was half as dense. 

That’s why gas like hydrogen and helium comes in so handy, you can change its pressure and density. 

Do it right and you can even have a hot and pressurized gas counteracting the weight of the shell so it needn’t be super strong. 

I sometimes think of this subset of a shellworld as a balloon world. 

The inside of a balloon is at a higher pressure than the air outside it to counteract the tension in the balloon and this is the same concept. 

In fact done right you could even get away with a magma layer and tectonic plates. 

But the key thing is that your filler’s density, to get the same gravity as Earth, is inverse to its size compared to Earth. 

Whatever the diameter or radius is in comparison to Earth, the density of your filler material is inverse to that. 

Triple your diameter and you need a third the density for your filler. 

Build a planet a tenth the diameter of Earth and you need a filler ten times denser. 

The other aspect is that regardless of how big or small you build one of these things you use the same amount of mass per square foot, one megaton. 

Whether your shellworld is a few dozen miles across or as big as Saturn, your living area costs you one million tons of matter per square foot. 

Saturn’s a great example of this because it is about a hundred time’s Earth’s mass, and ten times the diameter, if you built a shell around Saturn the gravity would be Earth normal and you’d have a planet with a hundred times the living area of Earth. 

All that actually matters is that average density, the matter can be all crunched up in one spot, like if you dumped an artificial black hole somewhere and built a shell around it. 

If you are building a shell that isn’t being supported by internal pressure it has to be very strong though. 

If you’ve got some very rigid and strong material you’re fine, but in many of these cases the strength needed way exceeds what any known material can handle. 

This where the orbital rings we discussed way back in the first megastructures video come into play. 

By using a stream of particle orbiting a planet normally, just like a planet ring, you can magnetically levitate material over that. 

You can go back and review that video if you want the details on how that works. 

So you build a ring, it appears as a solid object that is not moving though in reality it’s got its own filler of material orbiting the planet akin to a hose turned into a donut full of moving water. 

The more mass you pile onto that ring the faster the material inside needs to go. 

Now you build another ring at a different angle running a hair lower or higher. 

These don’t actually have to be perfect circles either, than can be ellipses, but circles would be preferable by and large and we’re building a sphere anyway. 

You build another ring at a different angle, and another, and another until you’ve got a grid mesh big enough to comfortably handle your shell and dump dirt and water and air on it. 

Now you would probably never build a shellworld like this unless you had figured out controlled fusion, both because you need access to that kind of energy source to build such a thing and keep it’s rings stable, but also because that’s what first justifies such a mass-expensive process in comparison to Rotating Habitats. 

If you’ve got controlled fusion, or artificial black holes, then hydrogen and helium become very important to you and you’d like to be able to keep your stockpiles in nice accessible chunks. 

I’ve mentioned earlier that you need a megaton of matter per square foot of living area on these things regardless of size, and to put that in terms of energy if you started off with a filler made entirely of hydrogen and converted it to helium you’d get about 6.3x10^23 Joules of energy per megaton. 

Now the average solar illumination on Earth is about 30 Watts per square foot, or about a billion joules per year. 

So that means your filler mass would provide fusion fuel to run your world for about 600 trillion years, more than a hundred thousand times longer than our sun has left to its life. 

You basically are using your filler mass as your power supply, either by using very tall lighthouses or a fake sun actually orbiting your planet. 

When that’s over you’ve lost about 0.7 percent of your mass so your surface gravity would only be 99.3% of what it was six hundred trillion years ago. 

That’s a very long time to adapt to a miniscule gravity difference but if you really want it to stay the same you can slowly shrink your world just a little to keep it the same. 

Now if you can tap into black holes or raw matter to energy conversion you can extend that lifespan a hundred fold and keep shrinking your world to keep the gravity the same. 

Which would also reduce the power it needs, extending that life time even further. 

So Shellworlds, while way more mass-intensive than rotating habitats, actually aren’t over sufficiently long times since if you’re building for the very long term your mass requirement is mostly for energy supplies. 

I mentioned in the discussion of rotating habitats that you’d keep your fusion fuel in non-rotating tanks around the habitat that also provided shielding from radiation and meteor impacts, but if you are building for a trillion year civilization then you might as well keep your fuel inside where it can provide gravity. 

You might also use shellworlds on pre-existing worlds like Earth or Mars, since it let’s you slowly extract the rocky material inside and replace it with pressurized tanks of gas or buried orbital rings to be switched on. 

A lot of times when we talk about doing Dyson Spheres or Dyson Swarms I get asked if I think we’d eventually disassemble Earth to provide more material and I would actually bet the answer is no, that we’d hollow it out instead. 

But this brings up the Matryoshka variant of a shellworld. 

In this every shellworld has many layers instead. 

I would actually bet that Earth itself is destined for some version of this, because we are likely to be pretty attached to our homeworld. 

You just construct another shell around the first, then another, then another, and you could also go down too. 

Keeping gravity at the same everywhere isn’t all that hard either. 

The interesting thing about a spherical shell of matter is that if you’re inside it you don’t feel any gravity at all. 

It all cancels out. 

So every layer above you, that you build, has no effect on the gravity of shells below you. 

Alternatively the mass of that shell does effect people living on it or above it on higher layers. 

So you just need to make sure each layer has the right total mass based on its distance. 

As an example, ignoring air for the moment, if I built a shell forty miles over Earth, which is about 1% of its radius, we’d expect gravity to drop by about 2% meaning we need to add about 2% of the Earth’s mass to that shell to keep the gravity right. 

Another layer, 80 miles up, would need about 4% of Earth’s mass to work, but you can count that lower layer against that total. 

A Matryoshka Shell can get very large indeed, just so long as your average density is decreasing to match that. 

Since air is about five thousand times less dense than the Earth, and about a thousand times less dense then water, you can build some pretty monstrously big worlds before this becomes an issue. 

Now you can’t just build a big globe of air without it compressing to higher densities, but if you’ve got layers of shells you can prevent that, and you can even have lower densities near to vacuum if those layers are far enough apart, same as our natural atmosphere decreases in density as you get up higher. 

Your individual layers can be a few hundred feet high or a few hundred miles high, dependent on what you’re aiming for. 

Of course if you have a layered shell world like this you need to provide artificial lighting and you’d have to worry about getting rid of heat. 

Neither plants nor human eyes need the level of lighting provided by noon-time clear sky sunlight so you can dim that down a lot. 

You can also pump heat outwards. 

A lot these designs use a variation of the Space Fountain we discussed back in the third video to hold up the sky in addition to orbital rings, and you can channel heat up that way too. 

Your actual top layer could be just a normal landscape but you might want to abandon that layer to a highly reflective heat pump with a bumpy surface to maximize how much heat you’re radiating away. 

In some versions of these with black holes in the middle you might go the other way and pump your heat into the black hole but that would depend a lot on how the thermodynamics of black holes actually works and we don’t know for sure if you can just dump heat into a black hole like that. 

If it is doable then there’s no real limit on your layers. 

If you need to vent heat via infrared radiation then you can only do so many layers and you’d probably be capped out at under a hundred. 

Sometimes we kick around the notion of the largest possible artificial world you can build, and this is an example since you could do this around, for instance, a white dwarf or neutron star and use them for power. 

Or even around a galactic core black hole, since those are about a trillion times more massive than Earth you’d get a trillion times more area on your shell, whereas even a dyson sphere only provides about a billion times the living area, and each layer would double that. 

Such a structure would be wider than the orbit of Pluto but it does have the mass energy of a million suns to run it so it could also stay powered for time increments way long than stars normally live. 

I’ve always liked this concept because the notion of some massive world with many trillions of times the living area of Earth located at the center of a galaxy just seems like the ultimate galactic empire capital. 

Now a common theme to these is always their longevity, even their natural gravity helps to prevent leakage of gases from slowly losing material. 

That’s why I mention white dwarf stars and neutron stars and black holes in context to these a lot. 

You really don’t gain much by building these unless you’re aiming for very long lasting civilizations, ones that outlast normal stars. 

Of course, if we ever find a way to manipulate dark matter, which is the supermajority of matter in the universe and far larger in quantity then rocky matter, it would also make a superb filler material. 

We don’t know much about dark matter yet besides that it generates gravity so if you could gather and contain it then it might have all sorts of useful purposes but the one we do know of for sure would be using it for filler material to generate gravity. 

It’s entirely possible that might be its only use, though sweeping it up and keeping it inside a shell is something we can’t do at the moment and may be outright impossible. 

Shell worlds are fun for fiction, though rather underused even there, and this particular video series is as much about fiction concepts as pure science so they are worth looking at. 

Usually they get dismissed as something you’d never actually build just because they use so much mass compared to something like a rotating habitat, but if you are building for the super long term or if you want a place like Earth to remain essentially intact but be bigger, they do start becoming realistically practical. 

They aren’t limited to examples of things you’d only ever build just because you can. 

Next time we’re going to take a look at something that you really only would ever build just because you can, by taking a look at flat earth Discworlds, and we’ll try to show that they aren’t actually all that impractical after all.

Moon Base Concepts

https://youtu.be/2zaIy1TARPE

Gonna go for landing Retro go Control go Surgeon go We copy you down, Eagle. 

Houston, Tranquility Base here. 

THE EAGLE HAS LANDED. 

In previous videos we’ve already leapt way past the moon to discuss terraforming planets, colonizing other solar systems, and buildings artificial worlds. 

We sort of skipped the moon because I tend to think of it as having been covered a lot elsewhere but in truth nobody really goes into much detail about what we’d do with the moon after getting a base there. 

Generally it is get there, set up base, use base for getting to Mars somehow, and mine it somehow. 

We don’t tend to see much actual discussion of this base and what it does. 

Or how it advances the general purpose of getting out into space or moves forward itself. 

I thought today we’d delve into that matter a bit more and explore some of the options and ideas. 

Before we go any further, if this is the first video on the channel you’ve seen then there’s two features you should be aware of. 

First, since I have a speech impediment the videos always include a transcript and closed caption subtitles you can turn on, some people have a harder time understanding me and that’s not even including all the arcane technical jargon these videos often have to include. 

Second, for the sake of brevity I occasionally reference other videos on this channel or other ones where a concept got discussed in more detail rather than repeating myself and if you see a thumbnail or video clip pop up in a yellow or white link box you can click on that and it will just pause this video and open that one up in a new window so you can watch that and return here where you left off. 

Okay, so people often wonder why we haven’t gone back to the moon since the 70s. 

We did it six times successfully in a few years nearly half a century ago and neither the United States nor anyone else has gone there since, at least with people. 

In the meantime we have vastly improved a lot of the relevant technology, especially computers and robotics which is part of the reason. 

Our rockets are better, are quality controls are better, and we can make vastly lighter or superior equipment to what we had in the late sixties. 

Fact of the matter is the US could easily do another series of moon landings and Congress is hardly afraid to cough up the cash for that since the taxpayers would mostly not object to the expense. 

The European Union, Russia, China, Japan, or frankly just about any G20 nation has the necessary technology and infrastructure to do it. 

So why hasn’t anyone? 

Of course some people doubt we ever went there in the first place, that it was all fake, and in these modern days of photoshop and CGI it’s hard to dissuade them. 

I’ve occasionally heard people suggest you could see the Apollo Landing sites through a telescope but that’s not true, even the Hubble telescope lacks the resolution to view the moon and even if it did I wouldn’t think that would convince anyone since someone could mess with the video feed. 

We can resolve human sized objects on Earth from space, but the moon is about a thousand times further away from us than those satellites are. 

You can’t see any man made objects on the moon through any telescope we have now let alone one available commercially. 

So a lot of people subscribe to the Moon Hoax theory I think mostly because they just can’t imagine why we haven’t gone back since and no one else has either. 

But the simple reality is that as things currently stand there’s not much real benefit to gain from doing so. 

Getting some more moon rocks or drilling some samples would certainly be nice but it’s not a particularly urgent project at the cost, there’s lots of other science of higher priority that can be done cheaper, and if we did do it we’d end up using robots which would defeat the purpose. 

We want to stick people on the moon again And collecting samples is honestly just an excuse to do that. 

So when someone inevitably points out a robot can do it better and cheaper we end up sending neither man nor machine because we don’t really need more moon rocks. 

I would suspect that given a long enough time, even without any more technological improvements, someone will get around to going there again but for it to be more than an exercise in national inspiration you have to have some real purpose in going there and with people, not robots. 

Part of the reason manned missions to Mars are so appealing, besides being a step forward rather than a repetition of past glory, is that the time lag to Mars is many minutes as opposed to the Moon which is only a couple seconds. 

So robots can be controlled more or less in real time on the moon. 

No thinking human brain actually needs to be on the moon overseeing the affair or doing the work. 

To push forward with the moon we need a genuinely valid reason to want to not just send people to the Moon, actual people not robots, we need a reason to justify a permanent presence there. 

So let’s consider what the moon has that Earth doesn’t… and unfortunately it’s not a terribly long list. 

First it lacks two things which Earth does have, an atmosphere and a gravity well. 

Gravity is a real downside to space travel and the moon has much less of that, and the same is true of atmospheres. 

What it does have that the Earth lacks is Helium-3. 

There’s just not much on Earth, truth be told there’s not much on the Moon either but it looks like there’s way more than we have here. 

This relative abundance of Helium-3 has sparked a lot of talk about mining the moon for it, to be used in nuclear fusion. 

There was great film, especially considering its low budget, called Moon back in 2009 in which such an operation was going on and of course tons of articles in various pop sci publications in recent years. 

Problem being we don’t have any nuclear fusion reactors to use it for fuel in. 

We discussed the impact of nuclear fusion last year and its huge, just a few kilograms of fusion fuel would produce around a billion kilo-watt-hours of juice, a hundred million bucks worth of power, and yeah its expensive to get to the moon and back but not that expensive, especially if you’re setting up shop and just shooting cargo back. 

Moon return trips are relatively cheap since there isn’t much air or gravity to keep you from getting off the moon and plenty of gravity to help you get back to Earth and air to slow you down on re-entry. 

So helium-3 mining is definitely a good reason to go back to the moon and stay there, you’d only need to return 10 or 20 tons of the material a year to run the US power grid. 

Again though, we don’t have a fusion reactor, and none of our main efforts to get fusion use Helium-3. 

They use deuterium and tritium, two hydrogen isotopes, because one of the hard parts about fusion is overcoming the Coulomb Barrier, the repulsive force between two positively charged atomic nuclei. 

Simply put, helium-3 consists of two protons and a neutron, whereas tritium is one proton and two neutrons and deuterium is one proton and neutron. 

Pushing a pair of protons together is hard, like repels like, and Helium-3 has twice as many protons as deuterium and tritium so it’s much harder. 

In basic terms the temperature you need to pull off inside your reactor is about ten times hotter if you want to use Helium-3. 

Now a helium-3 and deuterium reaction is a great power source but again it’s a much harder one to pull off then Deuterium-Tritium and both of those are relatively abundant on Earth and fusion is fusion. 

You get any working fusion reactor and you totally change the world. 

The advantage of helium-3 compared to them is mostly that it’s an aneutronic type of fusion and that has a lot of potential advantages especially for making a compact reactor that didn’t take up whole city blocks and might conceivably fit into a spaceship that didn’t dwarf an aircraft carrier. 

I mentioned in that video on fusion that as great as fusion would be it isn’t necessarily usable directly for spaceships since size and power output per mass of the reactor is very important for that application. 

We discussed a lot of alternatives for launch if you have a lot of power but it’s bulky, like mass drivers and launch loops, but helium-3 reactions and aneutronic fusion reactors hold a better promise of being able to actually cram a fusion reactor into a spaceship as a useful power source than deuterium-tritium reactions. 

But even then, you also don’t necessarily need the moon as a Helium-3 source for spaceships leaving Earth. 

We focus on Deuterium-Tritium because it’s an easier reaction than anything else to produce. 

But your ideal fusion reactor, besides one that runs on straight vanilla hydrogen, is a deuterium-deuterium reactor, because deuterium is very plentiful on Earth and all over the Universe. 

Deuterium-Deuterium requires higher temperatures than Deuterium-Tritium but not as much as Helium-3, and a Deuterium reactor produces tritium and helium-3 as its byproducts. 

If you want helium-3 you can just extract is from the reactor, and for that matter any leftover tritium will decay into Helium-3 too. 

That’s where we get out supply of Helium-3, we use Tritium to boost Fusion Bomb yields and with a half-life of only a dozen years we have to suck out helium-3 and replace it with new Tritium. 

Though I should note that Helium-3, even if you can’t use it for fusion fuel, is still useful stuff. 

Helium-3 is used for quite a few applications, these days it costs several thousand dollars a gram, hundreds of times more than gold, so at current market prices a ton of it shipped home from the Moon would fetch several billion dollars. 

Of course you’d expect the price to drop sharply if quantity were to soar and the US supply is only about 8 kilograms a year. 

Sort of like how we talk about asteroids with tons of platinum on them being worth several trillion bucks to stoke up asteroid mining interest, the basic economics of scarcity would suggest that value would drop to a fraction before you could sell it all. 

So while I don’t want to say the value of Helium-3 on the moon is overhyped it’s not really likely we’d ever be mining it from the moon to ship home. 

It’s also, again, not that abundant. 

It’s not like there are puddles of Helium-3 lying around on the moon to be sucked up and shipped home. 

Concentrations in general would be around 1 to 10 parts per billion on the Moon to maybe as high as 50 parts per billion in areas which are constantly in shadow. 

So if you want to come up with the 10 or 20 tons a year that would run the US powergrid you need to be ready to plow through at least a billion tons of lunar regolith a year. 

But it has some real possibilities as interplanetary spaceship fuel meaning the Moon could easily serve as the oil well of early and mid-stage interplanetary travel. 

There’s way better sources of it deeper out in the solar system. 

That’s not the only way the moon could can be of assistance though, just a recently popular one. 

We’re looking for an excuse to set up shop on the moon permanently and in a big way, with large bases hosting dozens if not thousands of personnel. 

Helium-3, even if we develop a reactor that can use it, probably isn’t that excuse unless for some reason that works out to be the only commercially viable fusion reactor, which doesn’t seem likely though there are some serious advantages to aneutronic reactors that might make it so. 

Still it probably won’t be, so what other reasons are there? 

Again because of the lack of air and gravity it’s a good place to serve as a base. 

It’s much easier to mine the moon, and in some ways easier to power yourself on solar power, than it is on Earth. 

Low gravity makes for much easier mining and much easier off-world transport. 

Lunar Regolith is very abundant in Oxygen, Silicon, Iron, Calcium, Aluminum, and Magnesium in that order. 

We wouldn’t ever mine those resources for Earth itself, Earth has plenty of those, but it’s useful for building space stations and space ships and if the infrastructure is in place the moon is a much better source of raw materials than Earth for stuff off Earth since you don’t have to lift the stuff through miles of air and much stronger gravity. 

Solar power is also a pretty decent option for the moon because it actually gets more light than Earth, as our atmosphere absorbs and deflects a lot of what arrives from the sun. 

Also solar power is often problematic on Earth because it goes away every day and clouds in the sky can make it very dim. 

No clouds on the moon and the day is a month long. 

The moon’s circumference is just under 7000 miles, and its day just under a month, so even at the equator where the day-night terminator moves fastest it still only moves a little under 10 miles an hour. 

On Earth very fast planes can outrun the sunset, on the moon a fast jogger could, and there’s no air resistance for vehicles and lower gravity so if you are mining on the moon you could conceivably use solar powered robotic vehicles that just circumnavigated the planet once a month under perpetual sunlight and returned to their base once a month for maintenance. 

We generally tend to think of moon bases as being nuclear powered, and that’s certainly an option, or solar-powered but running on batteries or fuel cells during the half-month of darkness but without air resistance and with low gravity rolling bases are a possible option. 

What’s more, it isn’t difficult to build tall towers on the moon, there’s no wind and the gravity is again very low, and the higher you are the more light you get per lunar day because the horizon isn’t blocking your light, there are places in the polar regions like Shackleton Crater that have spots that get sunlight 80 or 90% of the time. 

Since the poles are going to come up a lot in any discussion of moon bases let me explain that a bit more. 

We all know about the midnight sun and how places near our own poles here on Earth have months of perpetual darkness or sunshine. 

We also mention polar bases on the moon a lot and places where the sun shines longer. 

There are places on the poles of the moon where we expect to find more ice, the poles are colder, and ice is good because we need water. 

There are places on the poles that get light longer, or darkness longer, than near the equator too. 

This isn’t for quite the same reason as it is on Earth. 

On Earth, the Earth’s Axial Tilt relative to the Sun means that higher latitudes are constantly facing the sun for months at a time or faced away from the sun for months at a time. 

The moon on the other hand has very little tilt relative to the sun. 

This isn’t the cause of the places with long light or dark phases. 

There is a concept called the Peak of Eternal Light where a spot on a rotating object around a star might be lit all the time, or nearly all the time, not to be confused with tidally locked planets like we discussed some months back. 

On those the sun shines on one half of the planet all the time and never on the other. 

As we also discussed then, there is no ‘dark side of the moon’, because the moon is tidally locked to Earth, not the Sun. 

One Moon Day and one Moon year are the same length, one Earth month long. 

But there are places on the moon where the sun shines 80% or 90% of the time. 

And the cause isn’t axial tilt or orbital patterns, it’s that the moon is much smaller than Earth, with a much nearer horizon, and that there’s no winds or tides eroding all the craters on the moon. 

A mile high mountain on the moon juts out much more than one on the Earth, and the higher you are, the longer your day. 

Here on Earth if you climb up to the top of a very tall building or hill or mountain and your friend stays down on the ground next to you, you can see the horizon further off than he can. 

So you see the sun rise before he does, you see the sun set after he does, your daylight period lasts longer. 

We’ll take this simple globe and add a peak. 

Watch as the day-night terminator sweeps around and hits the high point first, and then as is sets how the high point remains illuminated longer. 

The higher the peak, the further it is to the horizon in each direction. 

This more pronounced on the Moon because the Moon’s diameter is considerably smaller than Earth’s so a mile high object sticks out more. 

Similarly if you were in a valley the sun would rise later and set sooner. 

If you were on a mountain peak that had two large valleys to the east and west located where your horizon would be if it was flat there instead the sun will rise even earlier and set even later. 

Same concept, if you’re in a valley with a mountain to the east and west the sun rises way later and the sets way sooner. 

So if you’re in a deep crater on the moon with large crater walls you won’t see much light, even less than on Earth since there’s no atmosphere scattering and reflecting light from other directions. 

This effect gets even more pronounced near the poles because the planet’s ‘diameter’, at least in terms of the distance from the axis of rotation, is even smaller and that’s what is actually blocking the light. 

Watch as these identical mountains at the same longitude but different latitudes have the day-night terminator run over them. 

See how the sunlight leaves the ones near the equator first? 

So we often have an interest in polar bases on the moon because they’ve got spots in them that get sunlight much longer, and often very close to places that get shadow much longer. 

Places on the poles which are under almost constant shadow are way better spots to find ice, also where you’d expect to find more Helium-3 for that matter. 

So a polar base located in a large crater is a nice base location since you’ve got some optimal places to put solar panels that can run most of the time and right nearby you’ll have dark spots where you’d expect to find more water ice. 

Also again, because gravity is so weak and there’s no wind, you can build incredibly tall flimsy towers that further extend your daylight, with solar panels or even just mirrors on top of them. 

You’d still need batteries or fuel cells but for a much shorter period of time. 

You could also get around this long night issue by using power satellites that beamed their energy down to a base. 

Satellites consisting of basically just a reflective parabolic dish and some attitude controls constructed on-site would be fairly easy to launch, as we’ll discuss in a bit, and could keep an area pretty well lit perpetually, or send it down as a power laser or maser to some receiver. 

For that matter the moon isn’t that big and it’s desolate, so you could just outright run power cords along the surface, or build a few solar towers that beamed energy to other towers not in the sun. 

Towers can get very tall on the moon because there’s just no wind and weaker gravity puts less compression on the materials. 

But that’s also not the only way to build a very tall tower, you can rely on tensile strength instead of its tall enough, that’s the basic concept of a space elevator. 

As we discussed in the Megastructures video on Space Elevators while we don’t have any material strong enough that we can mass produce to make a space elevator of earth we do have that option for the moon. 

A lunar space elevator is a bit of an oddball because it has to be longer than an Earth Space Elevator and can only point in two directions to be stable since the Earth perturbs lunar orbits much more than the moon disturbs Earth orbits. 

The first stable one would point right back at Earth, and the second directly away from Earth, but that’s fine. 

The one pointing at Earth needs to be 35,000 miles long and the one pointing away from Earth would need to be just over 40,000 miles long to the their respective docking ports, as opposed to a space Elevator on Earth which would be just 22,000 miles long. 

This is because the moon, while it has weaker gravity, also spins much slower. 

The one on Mars is much shorter because its day is about the same as Earth’s own but its gravity is a lot weaker. 

But the Moon’s gravity is so weak that you don’t need any ultrahard materials to build it from. 

Same as you can build towers on the moon very tall without much wind or gravity to impede you, we can build a space elevator on the moon much more easily than on Earth which makes it even better for mining to fuel space industries in the general area of Earth. 

But every space elevator needs a counterweight on the end of it, we usually picture this as some asteroid towed in for that purpose or some very large docking facility, on the moon that could be a bunch of mirrors in whole or part and not only are the tops of space elevators virtually always in the sun but even for the short time one lunar elevator wouldn’t be, the one on the other side of the moon would be and you could just bounce that light down to a base from the mirrors or beam it down as power. 

And you could target anywhere on the same hemisphere so with two elevators you could illuminate any place on the moon. 

Lunar space elevators are a pretty neat idea and the added power and light advantage makes them even more appealing but ground based solar and batteries or fuel cells, or just having a nuclear power plant, is probably more practical. 

Also while elevators are far easier to build on the moon they aren’t nearly as handy as they would be on Earth. 

We discussed mass drivers, space cannons, and launch loops a while back and the big issue using those on Earth to launch vehicles is you have to make the track very long to get up to the necessary speed to escape Earth while having a low enough acceleration to not crush human passengers. 

This is made much more impractical because you’ve got to keep the tunnel evacuated of air and getting the muzzle of the space cannon out over the atmosphere. 

That’s not even an issue on the moon. 

There’s no air, and the escape velocity of the moon is just over a fifth of what it is on Earth’s, meaning you only need about 4 or 5% of the energy and your track can be much, much shorter and you don’t need to elevate the end of the cannon over the atmosphere because there isn’t one. 

To get up to Earth’s escape velocity at just one gravity of acceleration requires almost twenty minutes of acceleration down a 4000 mile long track ending on towers many times higher than our tallest skyscrapers and the whole thing has to be a sturdy vacuum sealed tunnel. 

To get up to the moon’s escape velocity at one gee of acceleration wouldn’t require even 200 miles of track and it could just be track, like a normal railroad. 

Even though building giant towers on the moon is way easier than on Earth you don’t need them, there’s no air to flood your tunnel or cause drag or lift. 

Also track length drops proportional to acceleration so if you don’t mind subjecting people to, say, 4 gees of acceleration for just over a minute your track only needs to be fifty miles long, and if you’re just shooting raw materials or fairly sturdy manufactured items up than you can get away with a hundred gees easy and have a track just 2 miles long, truth be told raw materials like iron could be shot out at 10,000 gees or more easy, that’s the acceleration inside a rifle, and that would only need to be a hundred feet long. 

So we might not build a lunar space elevator even though we could just because using space cannons is so practical and way easier to shield from micrometeors and solar radiation, which are serious issues on the moon. 

You could launch stuff directly to Mars from there. 

You’d still need rocket fuel, but way less of it, and you can refine fuel on the moon. 

As noted earlier, lunar regolith contains huge quantities of oxygen, aluminum, and magnesium. 

Liquid oxygen burned with aluminum or magnesium is a pretty decent rocket fuel, and monopropellant gel of aluminum powder and liquid oxygen appears to be very promising too. 

We talked in the terraforming video about baking oxygen from rocks, but in summary form you could make from locally available materials whole acres of solar ovens and still for creating this fuel, which could also be used to help power a moon base during dark phases as well. 

Ships could leave the Moon for places like Mars or Asteroids via a mass driver boost and fully fueled up to speed up more and to then slow down. 

Or you could ship that fuel elsewhere. 

Truth be told, once the infrastructure is in place, it might make more sense to ship fuel from the moon to earth orbiting space stations refueling ships that left Earth Orbit then to ship up more fuel from Earth itself. 

It would really depend on how easy such fuel refineries were to build and maintain, and with the progress we’ve been making in robotics and 3D printing that might be very easy indeed. 

We do want to put people on the moon, but robots are almost certainly going to play a huge role regardless especially in early construction phases. 

Things would be a lot easier and safer, not to mention cheaper, if your initial moon base is constructed before the astronauts arrive by drones. 

Which brings us to our next point. 

The classic moon base tends to show up with a lot of glass domes but this isn’t a really good idea. 

People don’t particularly need direct sunlight, particular raw sunlight that hasn’t had the nastier stuff filtered out of it by out magnetosphere and atmosphere, and our plants wouldn’t do great under that light either. 

Glass is a poor protection from micrometeors too. 

So you wouldn’t be building your structures above ground, or if you did you come by and plow over them with dirt afterwards. 

A couple feet of lunar regolith between you and space is an ample shield against anything you really need to worry about and because of the lower gravity the structure doesn’t need to be too sturdy to handle that weight. 

If you need to get light in you can have glass walls and have your roof extend well over it, then just have mirrors bounce the light in. 

Those can be made to not reflect the harmful frequencies rather easily and mirrors don’t have to be made of material that shatters when it gets hit. 

So even your food crops wouldn’t be exposed to the open sky and your actual habitation areas would probably be as deep underground as you could comfortably get away with. 

I’ve also mentioned before, in both the terraforming video and rotating habitats video that while we can fake gravity with rotating structures in zero gravity, you can do this in lower gravity too. 

You have to combine the natural gravity with the spin gravity so that inside that structure your perceived down is at a diagonal. 

There’s no air outside for drag so it won’t take much energy to keep such a thing spinning. 

This keeps your moon men from suffering the ill effects of lower gravity, which is very detrimental to the body over long periods of time. 

Now again everything is easier if you’ve got working fusion, which you obviously would if you were mining the moon for helium-3, but setting up shop on the moon without fusion is definitely doable. 

It hasn’t been done thus far because it’s very expensive and doesn’t serve much point. 

It also the sort of thing where you need to go all-in, a small moon base manned by a dozen people like some polar research station isn’t the way to go, even if virtually everything is being run by robots. 

The moon is not Mars, signal lag time is only a couple seconds, so even maintenance on robots could be conducted by other robots controlled mostly real time from Earth. 

You don’t need a moon base for a Mars Landing, but if you’re hoping to truck thousands of colonists to Mars and have routine traffic and supplies going back and forth it makes that way easier to have the moon either directly in that loop or sending fuel to stops in that journey. 

And if you want to do anything serious on Mars you do need to send people, the time lag is just way too high for practical remote control. 

So any serious operation on Mars or any other location deeper out benefits from having a lunar base feeding in fuel and material to the travel loop. 

You don’t need people on the moon to do anything if you’ve got good enough robots, and I mean mechanically good enough not smart enough. 

You could control the entire operation from Earth. 

But if you want people there you need a decent number because you’re setting up a community. 

You’re growing food, cooking food, building habitats, repairing your robots, conducting experiments and so on. 

McMurdo in Antartica is probably your better example, even in the winters there’s about 250 people there and a few times that in the summers. 

We mentioned Dunbar’s number, around 150 or 160 people, during the interstellar colonization video and as a quick reminder that’s generally considered a good size for a community. 

You could get away with less than that though since it is only a couple seconds to the moon so while chatting on the phone with relatives would be a bit laggy, taking 4 or 5 seconds for you to hear their reply to “Good morning how are you?”, it’s still takes a lot of the psychological pressures off people in terms of those we encounter from remote outpost with small numbers. 

There a going to be things where that signal lag is too much, like performing surgery on someone who is injured, and there’s a lot of types of maintenance that at best would be a major hassle to do with a robot drone and a 4 second delay. 

Of course if you’ve got people up there you need to feed them, so you also have to grow all your own food, it costs tens of thousands of dollars in fuel to ship just one day’s worth of rations into low orbit and the moon is much more expensive, so keeping a hundred people fed on the moon perpetually would be running you billions of dollars, plus the vegetation can help recycle your air and water and waste. 

This raises the sunlight issue again, because the day last a month on the moon, meaning that except near the poles you’ve got to cope with two weeks of darkness. 

Even if your plants could handle two weeks of darkness they aren’t scrubbing carbon dioxide out of the air while you’re doing that. 

The two weeks of constant light is no big deal, if you’re pumping your light in via mirrors or fiber optics you just block that or tilt it away as necessary. 

Many plants do fine, even better, under longer light cycles, though others do not and many use it to trigger flowering so light control is a big deal if manageable. 

Darkness is another issue. 

You can get around that at some spots on the poles. 

Plants can handle a few days of low or no light by and large and you could run some lights off batteries or fuel cells or even rocket fuel if you’re mass producing that during light periods. 

Truth be told you’d probably be wanting to run those backup lights during the day a lot too, when power is abundant, since you can boost plant growth by pumping up the wavelengths of light that are used for photosynthesis and that lets you use less mirrors and you can build your farm a bit more vertically then. 

Which is doubly handy if you want to have higher gravity in your farms than the Moon’s actually got. 

Another nice thing about the moon is that with those long dark phases, low gravity, and no air it a pretty handy place to build telescopes, especially the new liquid mirror telescopes which could be made obscenely large. 

The basic concept of a liquid mirror is like our combined natural and spin gravity. 

When you spin a liquid on earth it forms a parabola from the mixture of gravity and centrifugal force, a natural parabolic dish you can shape by adjusting the spin rate of the device. 

We use mercury on Earth for this which isn’t ideal for the Moon but we’ve also been having some good progress with a class of organic compounds known as ionic salts that should function in that role on the moon and actually look like it might be cheaper to build on the moon than here on Earth and there’s no air or light pollution making it even better as a location. 

There’s one last object that can be built on the moon, and can arguably only be built on the so-called dark side of our moon and that’s a giant laser. 

We talked about using lasers for pushing ships to very high speeds and you’re probably also familiar with the idea of using laser to blow up or divert asteroids that might threaten Earth. 

The problem with big lasers is they are big weapons and the dark side of the moon is called that because it never faces Earth. 

If there’s one place in the Solar System you could feel fairly safe about building a giant laser that couldn’t be used as a death ray against our own cities, that’s the spot. 

Also when dealing with doomsday weapons if you actually run the numbers on the kind of energy the things use unless you’ve got special scifi unobtainium to get rid of the heat the entire thing ought to melt. 

You can only get rid of heat by radiation in space, so if you build it into an object like the moon you not only get all that rock to use as armor to protect critical components but you can also shunt all that heat into the moon by convection and conduction instead. 

That way you don’t have to big thermal exhaust ports your rebellious son can shoot torpedoes down and blow up your massively expensive doomsday device. 

The picture that gets painted here though is that a return trip to the moon really doesn’t serve much point unless you plan to set up permanent shop there in a fairly big way, and we’re unlikely to want to do that until we’re ready to seriously push out into the solar system in which case the moon has the potential to be an invaluable resource. 

We’re not ready yet, and it can be kind of depressing to think that it’s been almost half a century since we last set foot on it. 

But keep in mind that while Antarctica was first explored in the early 1800s, the first expeditions to get to the south pole took place decades later in the early 1900s and it was 1911 before Amundsen’s team got to the South Pole, narrowing beating the ill-fated Terra Nova expedition led by Robert Scott that arrived a month later in January of 1912. 

It was 45 years before anyone returned, and the US Navy flew in and established the Amunsden-Scott Station there, about the same time as it has been the last moon landings and the production of this video. 

Even then this facility wasn’t a major installation until more recent times, being completely rebuilt in the mid-1970s. 

Now, just over a century after those first two expeditions to reach the pole, it is a thriving and productive research facility manned by a few dozen in the winters and a hundred fifty in the summer, and is one of many such facilities in the Antarctic and Arctic. 

Good things take time, and just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should. 

Our base on the south pole is robust now because it’s useful, it’s vital for astrophysical and particle research. 

Whether a moon base comes about because helium-3 becomes valuable as a fusion fuel, or because we want to use the moon to get raw materials and fuel for projects around Earth or deeper in space, or as a lifeline to Mars and other planets and asteroids, or to build truly enormous telescopes on, or just from sheer human drive and human stubbornness to do it, or some combination of all those, it will happen eventually. 

So on that note we’ll close out for today.

So today’s video is on Interstellar Colonization, and it’s been a year-long trip getting here as we covered other subjects to build up to this. 

This seems kind of appropriate since as we’ll see today Interstellar Colonization is a process that involves a lot of year-long trips. 

Around a year ago when this channel was very new we discussed a concept called the Dyson Dilemma. 

In a nutshell it assumes that technological civilizations will be prone to expand and that if they do so we should be unable to miss that expansion even galaxies away. 

You don’t need to have seen that, or any of the other videos, before watching this but there’s some tied together material and I will occasionally reference it. 

It matters today only because we’ll be talking about how technological civilizations can expand. 

The ins and outs of that are a long subject and we had to lay a lot of groundwork to get here today to discuss it. 

Future videos will be able to be a lot more self-contained but this one, as mentioned, is a bit of final chapter to our first year so catching those other videos might be helpful if not absolutely necessary. 

Usually when I’m referencing one of those prior videos you’ll see a thumbnail picture pop up in a white or yellow box, clicking on those will pause this video and open that video up in a new window. 

I try to make these videos as self-contained as possible so first time watchers aren’t getting left behind. 

This isn’t supposed to be book ten of some series where if you haven’t read the prior ones you have no idea what’s going on, but I also don’t want to lengthen this already lengthy video rehashing material we’ve already covered. 

So if you’re new here and feel yourself losing traction on a subject you might want to watch the suggested videos and come back to this one. 

Also if you’re new to this channel by now you’d have noticed a speech impediment, to help with that these videos always include closed captions you can turn on with the transcript of the video. 

So intro complete, let’s get to what is essentially the epilogue of this channel’s first year. 

And we’ll do that with a bit of prologue to the notion of interstellar travel. 

Prior to the last couple centuries, with some noticeable exceptions, planets around other stars wasn’t given much consideration, let alone travel to them. 

During the 19th century the idea that our planet might be truly ancient, millions or even billions of years old, was beginning to settle into public awareness. 

At the same time the idea that the Universe was itself almost inconceivably old and huge and full of stars that might host equally ancient planets. 

Even our word for this, extraterrestrial, references terrestrial, our Earth, because most early notions of aliens reference other planets in our own solar system like Mars and Martians, as seen in H.G. Wells War of the Worlds or Edgar Rice Burrough’s Barsoom Series. 

We didn’t say Extra-Solarian, meaning outside our solar system, we said extra-terrestrial, meaning not from Earth and this wasn’t an accident. 

We just weren’t seriously considering traveling between stars and there being worlds like our own around them. 

Early science fiction on this emerged quite slowly and often didn’t do well with audiences. 

H.P. 

Lovecraft, famous sci-fi horror writer today, a century after he started writing, never caught on in his own time and probably because his work centers so much around the existential dread associated to contemplating just how old and huge our Universe is. 

This concept, that humanity occupied a tiny chunk of the Universe for an eyeblink of time, hadn’t really got its claws into our collective awareness yet. 

Not the first to deal with the concepts, but probably the one who most inspired others to think and write about them was Olaf Stapledon, who writing in the 1930s about long term civilizations, aliens, megaengineering, genetic engineering, and terraforming proceeded to open the doors of the imagination for many others. 

Immediately after that we saw an explosion in science fiction as a genre, the oft-called golden age of science fiction, in the late 30s and 40s when this stuff started really getting traction on people’s minds and with the Space Race of the late 50s and 60s it has stayed there. 

A generation after science fiction began popularizing the notion of alien planets we landed men on our own moon and landed probes on Mars shortly thereafter. 

Unfortunately that’s where it stayed, because our Moon is around a hundred times closer than other planets, and while we could send people to Mars and could have for some decades the cost and risks of associated to doing that have remained a bit too high for anyone to authorize what would by and large amount to a very expensive photo op. 

Similarly a permanent moon base hasn’t happened yet either. 

And the moon, the furthest place any human has traveled, a mere couple of light seconds from home, is nearly a hundred million times closer than the nearest stars. 

For comparison, if Earth was on the palm of your hand and the moon was sitting on the tip of your finger, Mars would be in your neighbor’s yard and our nearest neighboring star would be on a different continent. 

So to seriously contemplate interstellar travel we have to have a way to get there and on a timeline people can survive. 

Over the years we’ve spent a lot of a time contemplating these and so let’s review some of the one’s a bit more grounded in current science. 

Wormholes and faster than light travel would be nice, and we’ll look at those concepts in the future, but today we’ll assume we haven’t got them other than to note that if you do have them not much changes other than that things get much easier. 

We can skip chemical rockets. 

Traditional rockets just can’t deliver a big enough payload to any speed that would get you to another star in less time than human civilization has already existed. 

That leaves us two options, a better rocket fuel or not using rocket fuel at all. 

Do we have a better rocket fuel? 

Yes. 

Even before we landed on the moon we were already considering how to use Nuclear Power for propulsion, some of the popular efforts being Project Orion, Project Daedelus, and Project Longshot. 

In a nutshell, though each design is different, the loose concept is to explode nuclear bombs behind a ship in series and let the explosions keep pushing the ship to higher and higher speeds, then at the end of the trip to flip over and shoot off nukes in front of you to slow down. 

That sounds incredibly unsafe but rocketry always involves terrifyingly huge explosions so this is just scaling up a bit. 

They also scale up a lot in size, since the big issue is that you can’t really make very small nuclear bombs especially not ones that are particularly energy efficient. 

Loosely speaking a complete bomb, including conventional explosives, fissile material, and fusionable material in H-bombs, pack more punch per pound the bigger they are. 

So you might as well go with a big space ship since you can only absorb so much of the blast with a smaller one. 

These nuclear ship designs gave us our first hint that we could get to other stars because they can send very large ships through space at around ten percent of light speed ideally, and you can do a bit better if you’ve got actual fusion like we discussed in the video on that. 

They also presumably have nuclear power plants on board to handle life support for crews. 

Of course ten percent of light speed still means the nearest stars are decades of travel away. 

There’s some hypothetical ways of going faster we’ll get to but first let’s consider those early ship designs. 

If the trip is going to take decades, or centuries, to get to another star but can have very large payloads we can get people there. 

Except most will have died of old age by then. 

There’s been several approaches to this and I’m going to borrow a classification system by Steve Bowers, a friend of mine whose space artwork you’ve seen a lot of especially on this channel. 

Steve breaks the ships, these arks, into five categories. 

The first are Methuselah ships, named for the ancient biblical patriarch who lived longest in the Bible’s chronology so you can guess why we call these ships this. 

These ships assume the crew is conscious the whole trip and simply live the whole journey because people age slower or not at all. 

We’ve not really discussed biological immortality or transhumanism much on this channel but suffice it to say the notion of people living a lot longer is viewed by many in the sciences as not only doable, but quite probably a lot sooner on the horizon than regular manned interplanetary travel let alone interstellar travel so it’s not that far out there. 

Unlike faster-than-light travel it doesn’t violate or seriously bend any known laws of science either. 

The big problem with Methuselah ships is usually seen as boredom, even on a big ark ship able to hold a couple hundred people living on recycled air and water and hydroponically grown food powered by fission or fusion you’re going to get pretty bored as the years roll by. 

Now there’s no real maximum size on such ships, except that if you double your population you presumably need to double all your fuel and supplies, so you could send many thousands of people instead. 

As to boredom, well we get a lot of our entertainment digitally these days so it’s not like they’d be limited to carry a small library of films or books, and they’d keep receiving new stuff from home, even if it was increasingly delayed. 

So I don’t think boredom is a project-killer but it probably would be hard to keep enthusiasm going for centuries. 

This gets us into the second and better known version, Hibernation Ships, often called Sleeper Ships. 

We freeze you and wake you up later. 

Either running the ship automatically or with a small crew being thawed for short shifts before being re-frozen. 

This might be pretty attractive even if you were functionally immortal and it’s certainly a concept we’ve seen a lot of in fiction. 

We still don’t have cryogenics or cryonics, in a way that lets us freeze people and bring them back yet. 

A lot of people gamble we’ll figure out the ‘bring you back’ option eventually and get frozen even today, it’s not just Walt Disney, and it doesn’t actually cost much more than a sports car and is fairly comparable a lot of treatment processes for nastier ailments. 

Heck even traditional burials can be pretty pricy, so as prospects look better and cost come down it might get to be as common as burial or cremation. 

It might get pretty common even in a biologically immortal society as people might opt to bounce forward to more interesting times. 

I can easily see modern day equivalents to the pyramids just stuffed full of frozen bodies to maximize security and minimize costs. 

Sleeper Ship and Hibernation ship being kind of inaccurate, since you are definitely dead, not asleep, make me think pyramids aren’t a half bad comparison since they amount to giant crypts like the pyramids were. 

This area, in regard to spaceships, doesn’t require much consideration except the concern over whether or not you’d even want a conscious crew. 

Usually we figure on small team being awake just in case the automation fails but when you consider it, with decent automation, odds are probably lower of that automation screwing up by some internal failure or external variable then of a conscious crew member going ax-crazy and murdering everyone. 

You wouldn’t send off a sleeper ships unless you’d gold-plated your automation so the risk of someone going nuts probably would exceed the odds of a failure. 

If you haven’t got immortality or cryonics you can do the next category, Generation Ships. 

Here it isn’t people leaving Earth to land on an alien world, but rather their descendants doing so. 

The crew lives, eats, breathes, and breeds their whole life on a ship. 

Inside you simulate a decent living environment by having a rotating section, as we discussed in heavy detail in the Rotating Habitats video. 

Now classically people figure you need a big population for this so you don’t get inbreeding and genetic bottlenecking, and the same for your eventual colony, but while we can’t freeze and thaw people yet we can freeze and thaw sperm and eggs and implant them into people. 

We do this a lot already. 

And while there is a half-life on such things, they can’t currently be stored indefinitely, we also have DNA printing, where we can take a digital record of a piece of DNA and print it into a real strand of DNA which can then be implanted into an egg. 

Digital files not only keep longer, and can be redundantly backed up, but can be transmitted at light speed. 

So colonization issues worrying about genetic bottlenecking can be brushed aside with existing technology. 

So an Arkship of the generational variety probably just needs enough people to maintain a decently sane society, not a genepool, and as hunter-gatherers in origin we already have a concept for a tribe. 

Also a concept called Dunbar’s number, about 160, that contemplates the idea of active social structures. 

Dunbar’s number is a pretty popular figure to be used when discussing decently long-lasting but stable micro-civilizations because its small enough you can know everyone but large enough that you can have a wide selection of not just skill specializations but also of social options. 

Lots of selections for friends and romance and big enough that you can avoid people who you absolutely hate. 

And again you don’t have to worry about every potential partner being your cousin since you’ve got all that frozen or digitally stored genetic material to avoid the problem. 

The idea of freezing or printing genetic data, along with heavily automated Hibernation Ships brings us to our next type, which are Seed Ships. 

These are seen as the solution for when you don’t want to use a lot of mass and fuel for each trip. 

You send a very small ship that’s heavily automated, able to replicate machinery via 3D printing and such, and could for instance print an artificial womb. 

Seed ships arrive at their destination and seed the place. 

Automated terraforming including with plants and animals, and maybe even people. 

Classically you’d often send a seed ship ahead of a generation ship or hibernation ship so that the planet was part way ready when people arrived, since the seed ship could travel faster, but if you’ve got really good artificial wombs and automated child care and teaching programs you could grow your colonists there. 

The idea of children born in tanks from frozen or printed genetic material and raised by machines is pretty disturbing at first but we really have no way of knowing that this would result in total failure or a bunch of maladjusted antisocial lunatics. 

It just depends on how good your artificial intelligence is and if it’s as smart as a human it probably can raise a totally normal healthy kid, there’s no reason it couldn’t simulate normal human emotions or that they’d even be simulations. 

This option doesn’t tend to be appealing to many people though. 

Partially because if you’ve got Artificial Intelligence that good, and automation that good, it makes some wonder why you’d send people at all, or humans anyway. 

And that’s category five, Dataships, or basically very small ships with huge data packets that arrive at the destination and unpack themselves using local material. 

Up to and including unpacking people since it’s often assumed you could store human minds digitally and just upload them into cloned or cybernetic bodies built on the spot. 

These can presumably be very small and fast, potentially storing billons of minds on something no bigger than a soda bottle. 

These are often seen as a type of seed ship or hibernation ship themselves, and it should be noted that if you’ve gone all digital with people’s mind you can do light speed travel by just sending the data once a receiver has arrived. 

Needless to say this concept is very popular with fans of mind uploading and singularity but not so much with anyone who isn’t. 

So that’s our five types of ships, and they can all get the job done if you’ve got the right technology to run them. 

Right now we’ve got the technology to build a nuclear ship and run a generational ark, though actually paying to build one is beyond us right now and colonizing a planet is too. 

Colonizing is the big thing, but before jumping into that I want to give quick overview of some other propulsion systems that we’ll look at more in the future. 

I already touched on Fusion Drive, or Fusion Torch Ships, in the Fusion video, they’re basically nuclear powered ships that can go decently faster and let you have more cargo and don’t require nearly depleting our supply of fissionable materials like uranium just to launch one ship. 

They still have a limited fuel supply though and you need to use a lot not just to speed up but also to slow back down again. 

One version of this you might have heard of is called a Bussard Ramjet and it gets around the fuel issue by sucking in gases floating around space as fuel or propellant. 

It’s the basis of the ship that was the central theme for the sci-fi classic Tau Zero. 

Unfortunately it doesn’t look like this is going to be feasible since you’d probably lose more speed and energy pulling the matter in then you’d get out of it but we haven’t ruled it out entirely just yet. 

This is still seen as the most probable means for ships that don’t need fueling and can get up to arbitrarily high speeds or at least to fractions of the speed of light where you might not need to worry about how your crew spends the travel time because special relativity kicks in to seriously shorten it. 

However, its apparent tendency to use more energy than it produces, thus actually slowing the ship down instead of speeding it up, would still make it useful. 

Ships don’t just need fuel to speed up, they need it to slow back down again, I would say they need the same amount except that you really do need more to speed up since part of what you’re speeding up is the fuel you need to slow down again. 

If you can use a Bussard Ramjet, or similar device, to slow a ship down you don’t just save your slow down fuel, you get all the fuel back, or cargo space back, that you’d have had to use to store that slow-down fuel since you can decelerate using fuel you didn’t have to bring from home. 

And there’s a few other ways you can probably do this too we’ll look at another time. 

Bussard Ramjet’s aren’t the only way to get near light speed without coming up with some new science though. 

Another is using antimatter instead of fission or fusion. 

With antimatter you get total mass to energy conversion, that whole E=MC-squared thingy, and that lets you get way higher speeds. 

Project Valkyrie, a design for an antimatter powered ship, can get up to a very good percentage of the speed of light. 

Of course we have the big issue that we can’t manufacture antimatter in large quantities. 

That we use millions of times more energy to make antimatter than is in that antimatter, and that we have only some basic notions for how to store the stuff safely. 

On a similar scale we have black-hole powered ships, which aren’t quite as good as antimatter in truth but are pretty neat ideas we’ll look at another time. 

Summary form you use small artificial blackholes that are evaporating and giving off Hawking Radiation as your propellant, letting that radiation push your ship. 

The other side of the house is stuff that carries no fuel, or no more than is needed for running life support and doing some maneuvering. 

Rockets aren’t the only way to push things along, nor is slapping them from behind with a nuclear detonation. 

If you’ve ever seen a light mill, a Crookes Radiometer, then you know the concept. 

Take a fan setup in a vacuum painted white on one side and black on the other and it will spin like a water wheel as light bounces off the white side and gets absorbed by the dark side. 

Light has momentum and if it gets absorbed by something it passes that momentum to the object. 

If it gets reflected away it passes even more momentum. 

It’s not a lot of momentum but this is the basic concept of a light sail, also called a photon sail or more commonly a solar sail. 

Solar sails aren’t great for interstellar travel because the further you get from the sun the weaker your push. 

New materials like graphene, than can in theory be made so thin you could sit on a stack a billion sheets thick before your feet started dangling, make this more attractive than materials like gold or aluminum which can’t be made nearly as thin and still be reflective and hold together. 

But you can still only get so fast before the weakening solar push meets up with the increasing drag of running through gases in space which keep it from being a total vacuum, achieving terminal velocity just like an object falling on Earth. 

Same concept as a parachute, your solar sail will make that happen at a much slower speed and then you’ve got to pack the thing up, though you can unpack it as you near your destination to slow down. 

You also have to repair and replace damaged sections since slamming through space involves hitting a lot small objects when your sail is a billionth of a meter thick but millions of meter across. 

There is an alternative though, you can hit the sail with lasers instead, or microwaves, masers. 

This lets you concentrate the energy on a much smaller target, needing a smaller sail, and laser beams don’t weaken over distance as inverse square the way sunlight does. 

You’ve also got no way to slow down unless you have a laser at the other end, but as I mentioned we do have some tricks for slowing down and even if you had to carry fuel to slow down in whole or part that’s a lot better than having to carry all the fuel to speed up and to speed up your slow-down fuel too. 

So light sails, or laser sails, are pretty promising. 

The down side is that while we can predict the location of a ship moving through a near vacuum very accurately, it isn’t a pure vacuum so you can’t predict it exactly. 

And the degree of imprecision is going to keep getting bigger the further away it is and the longer you have to wait for a signal to get back telling you definitively where it last was. 

Your laser also is slowly diffusing as the beams aren’t actually perfect cylinders and they are also running into space dust which weakens them to so you have to make your sail bigger and bigger to be accurately aimed at as you get further away. 

At best the size of your sail is going to need to scale up linear to the distance from the transmitter, double the distance, double the sail size, and that’s being unrealistically optimistic. 

If you’re having problems picturing the difference between this and a classic wind sail, imagine a guy with a catcher’s mitt and ice skates on a long smooth sheet of ice. 

You keep throwing him baseballs and he speeds up every time he catches one. 

Eventually though he’s too far away to catch your throws. 

He can also speed up more by bouncing the ball off his mitt instead of catching it and he can steer by bouncing it in a slightly different direction, which works with photons just as well as baseballs. 

Realistically the only way to get around this problem, to get really high speeds, would be to have a long chain of laser emitters along the way that could pick up where the last laser left off, like the guy on the sheet of ice who leaves the range of the first pitcher and passes a second pitcher who begins tossing to him, on to a third, onto a fourth, and so on. 

If the line is long enough pitcher down the road can start slowing him down too by throwing to him as he approaches them rather than as he’s leaving them behind. 

If you saw the fusion video and rogue planet video and rotating habitat video you can probably guess where this is going. 

Interstellar space is lousy with little rocks and comets, and not so little rocks and comets. 

It’s nowhere near as dense as stuff in our solar system but it doesn’t have to be. 

You can set up tons of pusher stations along the way to another star, automated or populated, and basically make yourself a long highway through space that let you shove ships pretty fast, at highly relativistic speeds potentially, and you could build your way out there sort of like building a railroad. 

This is also much easier if you’ve got a free method of breaking like a bussard ramjet or mag sail but at a minimum it’s easier to carry your deceleration fuel but if you don’t have to carry the fuel to accelerate you’ve way more than halved your onboard fuel needs. 

Once you get to the target the first time, and you can build stations down the whole length, you don’t need to carry any fuel except for some maneuvering. 

It probably requires a lot more effort and time than a single one way trip with a nuclear powered ship but once you’ve got it in place you can hurl way more material back and forth faster and cheaper between two star systems. 

That’s important as we move into the actual colonization section of the video because as we’ll see, while all these methods let you colonize planets, none of these methods really make for a sane way to do migration if you’re trying to deal with an overpopulation problem. 

So we’ve looked at most of the ways of getting to alien worlds, what do you do when you get there? 

We discussed terraforming worlds in the terraforming video but while most stars probably have planets, even planets that we could terraform, most won’t have ones that are particularly like Earth and it seems a shame to waste a perfectly good solar system. 

Then too, New Earth probably isn’t going to be your first destination or sole destination on arriving, even if it is amazingly Earth like. 

Let’s think about our generation ship as it slows down and enters a system. 

It’s essentially a rotating habitat, like we discussed in that video, but as I mentioned rotating habitats aren’t great for space travel because an ideal habitat is very Earth-like and that tends to imply it carries a lot more dirt and water on board than is really necessary for a real spaceship where every pound counts. 

Difference between a luxury houseboat or freighter and a speedboat. 

But there’s going to be darn few planets sitting around in the galaxy that conveniently have earth-breathable air mixtures, lighting, and so on so you probably don’t want to be just piling down from your spaceship, where people have been comfortably living for generations, onto the probably barren hellish wasteland of your new world. 

You’re also probably bingo on fuel. 

And unlike setting up a space based infrastructure from down on Earth it’s a lot easier to build one when you’re already up there. 

So destination one is probably not going to be the planet, it’s going to be one or more small rocky or icy asteroids or comets you can intercept easily and basically dock right on top of and snatch resources from. 

Then you go to a planet, probably leaving one or more asteroid bases behind you. 

If you’ve got something strong enough to make a space elevator from, especially if you can synthesize that from local asteroids since they are very heavy, you do that. 

Heck you could coil the elevator around the outside of you ship during the flight as extra radiation shielding but making it on the spot is easier. 

Now you don’t have a generation ship, you’ve got a full blown rotating habitat that can handily serve as spaceport and comfortable living area, more comfortable than you traveled on, parked around your destination planet. 

If you’ve got the elevator than you can unload easier but also reload too, so people aren’t stuck in domes the whole time. 

This makes terraforming a lot easier, especially if the process calls for material not found in great quantity on the planet. 

But realistically, with Earth-like planets around Earth-like suns likely being the minority of solar systems in most cases you won’t even try terraforming planets in favor of basically terraform small moons and asteroids, again as discussed in the Rotating Habitats video. 

They’re not truly planets but they actually will approximate Earth in most respects better than most planets you’ll find. 

The other issue is that colonizing planets, and just planets, is a damnably inefficient way of spreading out your civilization. 

It’s not just all the solar systems you’re bypassing to find nice planets either. 

Let’s walk through some quick math. 

To avoid relativistic calculations and rocketry I’m going to assume real quick that these ships always travel at around a tenth of light speed and are insanely efficient. 

That they let you transport a human and everything he or she needs as though he were just two tons of material magically given the appropriate kinetic energy to be at about 10% of light speed and didn’t need to slow down. 

Kinetic energy being half the mass times the square of velocity, and the velocity being about a tenth of light speed, we get about 10^18 Joules of energy. 

This is almost absurdly generous but we’ll go with it anyway. 

If you remember the video on Fusion, we talked about how you could easily and luxurious support a person for one year trillion joules of energy a year, or 10^12 Joules, one millionth of or way over optimistic figure for getting someone to another star system. 

You could support a thousand people for a thousand years for the energy cost of moving one person to another solar system at a tenth of light speed. 

If you want to get them there twice as fast, it will take at least quadruple the energy. 

So if you’ve want more people, and you need more space, it makes way more sense to build a rotating habitat in our own solar system able to support a thousand people for a thousand years in luxury than to cram one person on a ship. 

Particularly considering you’ve already got a star on hand pumping out a billion times more energy than we use on Earth all going to waste. 

Send people slower, at say 1% of light speed, and it costs about a hundredth the power as 10% light speed, again assuming very amazingly efficient propulsion and life support. 

That’s still all the juice you need to support one person for 10,000 years as opposed to sending one person to another solar system. 

This doesn’t mean you can’t colonize, it just means it isn’t a particularly sane way to get rid of surplus populations. 

Just like colonizing some new continent, you don’t ship half your population there, you send small colonies and wait for them to grow. 

Of course if you’ve got a whole star’s excess energy to play with, while you’re building up the inevitable Dyson Sphere or Dyson Swarm you can use all that extra energy to power laser sails. 

So you don’t have to pick and choose because the star is pumping out absurd amounts of otherwise wasted energy the whole time and it’s a lot easier to build solar panels than effectively fake micro-planets. 

Hopefully you have fusion but you can beam power around out from your star, losing some at each step, but just like the beaming stations for possible laser sails you can feed your solar power outwards with reasonable efficiency if you need to run operations too far from the sun for natural sunlight to power them, and if you haven’t got fusion. 

So, here we are at the end, and we’ve got a bit of a callback to the original Dyson Dilemma video of the Fermi Paradox. 

In that I proposed that you’d expect to see alien civilizations expanding outwards constantly by swallowing stars into wave upon wave of Dyson Swarms, massive cloudlike constructs of artificial habitats and solar collectors. 

Here we see a slight alteration on that theme. 

Instead of jumping from G-type yellow star to star, settling a few Earth-like planets in the classic science fiction setup, or even swallowing every star inside giant Dyson Swarms, we’d probably expect civilizations like our own to slowly roll out. 

They’d Dyson up their star, like giant cities, but they’d settle small rocks in the outer solar system and run those on fusion obtained from gas giants, in a sort of wide disc. 

Think of these as suburbs. 

From their they’d roll out into their own Oort Cloud and interstellar space and grabbing the rare rocks and turning them into habitats powered by fusion. 

This becomes your rural areas, and the stretches along the way to various nearby solar systems become your highways, possibly pushing ships along or slowing them down and allowing much higher bandwidths of information transfer between solar systems since the beams can be kept nice and narrow and high density with all the relays, these enter the developing suburbs of another solar system’s outer areas and the emerging Dyson Swarm near the Star, another city on the grow, of course these cities have trillions of times more people in them then modern earth cities, and the rural areas are trillions of times less dense than our own, but the analogy holds and is probably way more likely to be how we’d settle the galaxy then we tend to envision in classic science fiction setup. 

And in this kind of setup you can also migrate people a lot cheaper, because they don’t have to move very fast to avoid boredom and you can start employing methods that let you recover some or even most of your kinetic energy used for transport, like a mass driver that shoots you from one habitat toward another one which catches you using the reverse process and sucks your kinetic out to power another launch. 

Or bouncing the pushing laser beam off the mirror on the back of the ship to be reabsorbed by a large solar panel array back at the station. 

Someone wanting to leave Earth for new worlds just slowly bounces from place to place, every outward, always with some new place to see, at slower speeds and thus using less energy travel. 

If they’re biologically immortal they’ve got all the time in the world to see a place, hop on board slow freighter to something much closer than the next star, see that place, and move on, slowly working outward. 

If not, if like you and me they age, then they settle somewhere not too far from earth and their kids continue the journey. 

You mosey outward to the galaxy at say an average speed of a thousandth the speed of light and you get to the edge of the galaxy in a hundred million years, about one percent of the age of the Universe currently and it’s pretty young still. 

You can do it faster of course, as we’ve seen. 

Now at the edge galaxy you stop right? 

Well, nope, you don’t have to cross endless empty space to the next galaxy because it isn’t empty space, just emptier. 

Like Interstellar space compared to interplanetary space it’s got a lot of stuff in it just more spread out. 

Some estimates suggests as many as half the stars in the Universe are between galaxies not in them, and galaxies aren’t spaced out like solar systems are. 

Galaxies are only about an order of magnitude, ten times, further apart from each other than they are wide. 

So you’d have to travel a lot further to get to the next star roughly along the way to that new galaxy but we’re talking hundreds or thousands of light years not millions, each one serving as a new beachhead. 

And that’s interstellar and intergalactic colonization for you. 

And that’s it for year one of this channel, we’ll have a channel update video sometime soon then press ahead with some of our other megastructures and habitable planets subjects but now we can broaden out and look at other subjects because we’ve come full circle with the Dyson Dilemma and Fermi Paradox. 

Back in that we encountered the problem that we just couldn’t see how any technological civilization even a little like our own wouldn’t expand out constantly if it could expand reasonably, and how we shouldn’t be able to miss seeing them even if they were galaxies away if they’d been doing that. 

Now we’ve taken the long road to explain how that could be done without needing any truly groundbreaking, paradigm shifting science and technology. 

Leaving us right back at the question, if aliens are out there, why haven’t we seen them yet? 

And an answer, not a definite one but an increasingly likely one, that if there are other intelligent alien civilizations like our own out there they are so rare that you’d probably need to search a million galaxies just to find one. 

The Dyson Dilemma of the Fermi Paradox, if there were any older civilizations nearby us we would see them simply by the absence of any stars in the night sky. 

Thanks for joining me on this year long trip, if you’ve arrived here from all the older videos, it’s been a fun time and there will be more ahead. 

If this was your first video on the channel, hopefully not seeing the others yet didn’t make this too information dense and compressed, but you might want to go try those other videos now.

Megastructures E04: Rotating Habitats

Today’s topic, Rotating Habitats, is going to be a rather long one by the standards of this series thus far, so we’re going to jump right in. 

On the off chance this is the first of my videos you’ve ever seen though, you’re strongly encouraged to turn on the closed captions, my voice takes a bit of getting used to. 

So our subject today is Rotating Habitats, and the first thing to understand about rotating habitats is that it is a huge zone of options, all linked by only one common denominator: Centrifugal Force. 

If you’re in a place that has no gravity, and you want some gravity, the only two ways we currently have to do that is to either pile a ton of mass together for its natural gravity or to fake it with ‘spin gravity’, essentially to use centrifugal force to mimic gravity. 

Odds are if you’re watching this video you already know what centrifugal force is, we all encounter this force on a regular basis. 

You’ve probably heard it referred to as a fictional force as well, or more accurately as one which does not exist in an inertial reference frame, but for our purposes it’s real enough. 

It’s real enough because it lets us hold objects down against a surface like there was gravity even though there isn’t, and so long as the vessel you’re spinning is decently sized, basically bigger than a football field, the mimicry of gravity holds for most biological purposes. 

So we can take a big ring, or cylinder, or torus, or anything else with radial symmetry like a sphere and spin it around and the sides become a floor you can walk around on. 

You can even jump up and down and land where you’re supposed to as the fake gravity keeps working even when your feet leave the floor. 

You won’t quite fall straight down due to Coriolis Effect but for any normal human leap on any decently sized rotating habitat you’d never be able to tell you missed your mark without highly precise equipment. 

This gives us our first issue with using rotation to fake gravity though. 

That Coriolis effect can be a bit disorienting on humans as it acts on the inner ear to cause dizziness and nausea. 

As best as we can tell anything beneath 2 RPM, 2 rotations per minute, doesn’t affect anyone, and we expect people could adapt to rates of 20 RPM or higher. 

It’s basically akin to motion sickness though. 

Problem is, a slower rotation, or fewer RPM, results in weaker gravity. 

That’s fine for a space station, we can get away with picking astronauts who are less sensitive to the effect and go with less gravity. 

You could get away with having a metal can in space 30 feet in diameter spinning 10 times a minute and producing half gravity for astronauts. 

That’s probably okay for some Mars Mission where they need to adjust to lower gravity anyway and you can pack a lot of Dramamine along for the motion sickness. 

But this video isn’t about space stations or ships, it’s about full blown habitats. 

Places that comfortably simulate what we’re used to. 

So we’re not interested in anything that doesn’t produce normal Earth gravity in a comfortable way. 

To get higher gravity at a slower rotation we need to make the rotating structure wider, and if you want Earth gravity provided under that 2 RPM threshold then your diameter is about 1500 feet or 225 meters. 

This is basically the minimal threshold for building mock environments since the idea is comfort, you can go wider, but you don’t really want to go skinnier. 

You can’t go too much wider though because the wider these things get, without decreasing the simulated gravity, the more stress is put on them. 

For steel the usually assumed maximum is on an order of a diameter of several miles, for stuff like Kevlar or Carbon Nanotubes it’s much higher and is a lot like the problem we discussed way back in episode one regarding space elevators. 

Essentially the breaking length of a material in normal gravity tells you the maximum circumference of a rotating habitat made of that material simulating normal gravity because it’s the same thing. 

Since you’re operating in the vacuum of space besides the initial energy to get it spinning you don’t need to add much more to keep it spinning. 

That’s why mechanical flywheels in a vacuum are such an attractive option as batteries. 

No air drag to slow them down. 

Which means you can sack some of your gravity for emergency power too. 

While their diameter is controlled by the strength of the building materials, and the amount of gravity you want, the length of the habitat is not, you can go anywhere from a thin ring to an arbitrarily skinny cylinder. 

So that’s the basic intro, how the fake gravity works and what the control factors are. 

When we talk about rotating habitats in any long term sense, beyond just avoiding health ailments for astronauts, we’re talking about doing something that mankind has never truly done before, and that’s make more living space. 

Oh, we’ve built some fake islands, cut into mountainsides, or built vertically from time to time but as a whole, while we’ve made land and sea more livable to us, we’ve never added to it. 

Earth is our only world and its size does not change. 

If you want to add more people you can improve your farming technology and in the video on Fusion we discussed some of the ways you can use that, if you’ve got that, to really push out your maximum sustainable population, often called your carrying capacity, without wrecking your ecology or reducing everyone to a lower standard of living. 

There’s some other ways to push that even further we’ll look at in the future but ultimately you can just only pack so many people on a planet comfortably before you run out of space. 

Rotating Habitats give us a way to increase that space. 

The classic version of this is called an O’neill Cylinder, and its 20 miles long and 5 miles wide, about as wide as you’d comfortably want to make something like this out of steel. 

That means its internal surface area is 314 square miles. 

For comparison that’s about half again as big as Guam or a third the size of the State of Rhode Island or a quarter the size of Long Island New York, and almost identical in size to the island nation of Malta. 

So an O’neill Cylinder is not a small object. 

And you can go larger, titanium would roughly let you quadruple that, and stuff like Graphene could hypothetically let you make things on par with continents. 

You can also connect the things together, like a string of sausages or in various other configurations. 

So that material strength issue isn’t all that strong a control factor on your true interior size since they can be linked to fairly seamlessly create one greater structure, even if it would be more like an island archipelago than a vast continuous plain. 

You can also go bigger by having multiple levels, the lower ones having slightly higher gravity than the higher ones, which is actually true on Earth too though much less noticeably. 

You can only go so many levels before even just the waste heat of lighting the place would make it uncomfortably warm even with an array of radiator fins on the cylinder. 

In space you can only get rid of heat by radiating it away, same as how our planet gets rid of its own heat. 

In and of itself that’s the basic intro to what rotating habitats are and what the basic issues with them are. 

Now let’s get into some of the more fun aspects as well as some of the challenges. 

The first and most obviously big one is cost, which is way worse right now when we have to drag every ounce of building material up into space at phenomenal costs. 

We already talked about that in the prior videos though, and space is full of asteroids we can cannibalize too. 

If you feel like we’re going invent fusion one day, that we’re going to get way better at automated manufacturing and 3D printing, and you think we’ll get one or more of those cheaper launch systems built that we discussed in previous videos, then we can skip cost for now. 

Needless to say building new living area from scratch is a pretty major endeavor. 

But if you’ve got all three of those things you can do it. 

Heck you don’t even need fusion but it saves the effort of screwing around with mirrors to bounce sunlight in to the habitat or transparent sections or needing to keep them fairly close to the sun, meaning you can use those asteroids out in the bet without having to either drag them close to the sun or creating giant parabolic mirrors to bouncing light in. 

We should start this section then by discussing one common misconceptions about rotating habitats, and that’s the idea that you can see one spinning. 

Most of the images or videos of these I’ve put up so far, or that you can see elsewhere, always show them spinning. 

Usually when someone talks about building them inside hollowed out asteroids they will say they spun the asteroid. 

That last is especially wrong since only the largest asteroid have any really noticeable surface gravity and they’re all basically wads of gravel loosely held together. 

Spin one up to Earth gravity and it will fly apart. 

But the notion of using hollowed out asteroids is on the right trail, because all that rock under your feet between you and space provides nice shielding from radiation and meteorites. 

Here’s the thing though. 

You don’t need your exterior shielding to spin any more than you need the casing for a centrifuge or washing machine to spin. 

In fact it’s pretty damn dumb to do that. 

Space ships with rotating sections won’t have some big hub you can see turning from outside, just some superstructure that doesn’t spin that it’s nested inside. 

That way your superstructure shielding isn’t under all sorts of strain from spinning when it’s taking hits, and what’s more everything that hits a rotating object is going to either add or subtract some of that spin speed to its relative strike speed, damage is pretty much synonymous with raw kinetic energy, which goes with the square of velocity, even though half as many objects are striking slower and half faster, you still take more damage. 

So you don’t see rotating habitats spin since inside you’re spinning with it and can’t tell and outside it’s surrounded by some non-rotating superstructure, or possibly one rotating considerably slower in the opposite direction. 

This shielding material doesn’t necessarily need to be rock, or ice, or metal either. 

You could use the most common substances in the universe, hydrogen and helium, as shielding. 

Hydrogen is also one of the best shields against cosmic radiation, pound for pound. 

So you could surround your rotating hab with a non-rotating superstructure full of hydrogen tanks and other layers of shielding as seen appropriate. 

On a ship you can use that hydrogen as fuel, and you can also use your air and water reserves as more shielding. 

Radiation doesn’t really hurt them and better a micrometeor knock out a bit of your reserves than to knock out you. 

But in the context of asteroid mining we would presumably use the slag. 

The thing is, you don’t really need to hollow out an asteroid. 

If you come across any of the roughly million or so asteroids in our solar system that are around a mile wide that’s really not a good approach. 

It’s not hard, shoveling rock on even a big asteroid with decent gravity is like shoveling packing peanuts, and even on the largest, Ceres, generally considered a dwarf planet now not an asteroid, you could bench press a truck without breaking a sweat. 

One these smaller ones, the mile across kind that outnumber the big named ones thousands to one, you could kick around boulders the size of your house and your big problem mining is you’d need to erect a dome over you to keep the debris flying off into space. 

Asteroids generally don’t tend to be one solid chunk of rock you’d need to cut either, many are basically wads of gravel. 

Nothing you build inside needs to be terribly sturdy either, your typical asteroid is so small and with such weak gravity that even under hundreds of feet of material the pressure isn’t strong enough to crush an empty beer can, so you don’t really need to shore your tunnels up like you do when mining on earth. 

So why wouldn’t you hollow one out then? 

Well in a nutshell because it’s intensely wasteful of material. 

Let’s say you come across some conveniently spherical rocky asteroid a mile across and want to use rock as your shielding. 

Fact of the matter is anything much beyond a dozen or so feet is going to stop micrometeors with ease and drop cosmic radiation to near nothing. 

Here, on Earth, over your head, is about 14 pounds per square inch of air or 10 tons per square meter. 

That’s roughly comparable in mass to being under 10 meters of water or 3 to 5 of typical rock, so you’ve got as much raw mass between you and space with thirty feet of rock as you do down here on Earth. 

But let’s say you want a hundred feet of protection of rock, way more than is needed to protect you from anything but a direct nuclear strike. 

You’d still have only used about 3 or 4% of that mile wide asteroid, and a much smaller percentage on a bigger asteroid. 

And the rest, all hollowed out, it just air surrounded by a thin layer of dirt, water, and steel. 

What do you do with the rest of that raw material? 

Well you could ship it all off elsewhere but rock is really only valuable for making habitats once you’ve stripped out the valuable stuff like platinum, gold, iridium, and so forth it doesn’t have much export value. 

Truth be told with asteroid in this size range it’s probably easier to mine it if you spread it out anyway so you might want to just make the whole asteroid into one much bigger hollow sphere 5 or 6 times wider and then just slowly replace what you mine over the year with hydrogen tanks. 

In the long run, in a fusion economy, you’d want to trade away excess minerals for larger quantities of hydrogen stored in exterior tanks that slowly replaced that rock as shielding. 

As discussed in the fusion video you could light up and power a rotating habitat for billions of years with less hydrogen then you’d use just normally shielding it from cosmic radiation. 

So you can take that tiny asteroid and turn into a nice big sphere with a rotating habitat inside it and lots of zero-gravity storage or industrial spaces or smaller additional cylinders, maybe to used for hydroponics. 

When dealing with a bigger asteroid you can either break it up into multiple spheres or if you don’t want bigger cylinders you can arrange your cylinders into various geometric shapes touching each other at the tips. 

This brings up another point. 

These things don’t have to be the same radius the entire length, you can taper them at the edges and the gravity will fall off as it gets more slender. 

You can also put in dips and rises in the shell to let you get away with taller hills and deeper lakes without needing to put tons and tons of dirt and water inside. 

Similarly new materials like aerogel, that are incredibly light weight and sturdy, could be used below the topsoil to help. 

We don’t generally dig much more than a few meters deep on Earth nor do most roots go much deeper, so there’s now real need to have hundreds of meters of dirt and rock in these things. 

Lighting for the inside would either be provided by mirrors coming in through the cylinder caps or preferably by fusion powered lamps putting out their light only in those frequencies we can see or that plants use, that helps cut down on waste heat letting you do multiple layers without sacrificing the aesthetics. 

And the upward curving horizon can be dealt with in part by just disrupting the flatness with hills and valleys, though on very large rings you wouldn’t even see that. 

Big difference, and the hardest one to deal with, is that the sky isn’t blue and cloudy, it’s your neighbors, and the stars in the night sky are their porch lights. 

You can get some of that blue with lots of lakes as opposed to grass and forest since water really is blue, but if people really wanted that blue sky effect you’d probably want to nest another smaller thinner cylinder inside to fake a sky, preferably a bit more elaborately than just painting it but that would presumably work. 

When you’re building land many meters deep over a thick steel shell building a giant LCD TV overhead isn’t really that much of a stretch either. 

And again if you’ve got fusion to power these things you can build them anywhere. 

Around planets from the smaller moons or rings, out in Oort Cloud, out in interstellar space. 

They’re fairly mobile too though not ideal as spaceships since they’ve got so much superfluous mass in the name of comfort. 

As we discussed in the Rogue Planets video, interstellar space is littered with junk, there might be more planets and asteroids between two stars than around either in their solar systems. 

Maybe a lot more. 

These things are more than big enough to support sufficient gene pools even if technology didn’t give us a lot of easy workarounds to genetic bottlenecking. 

So just as example if some ideological or religious group here on Earth decided they wanted their own sealed off place they could grab any of the millions of asteroids or comets kicking around our solar system and turn it into a habitat able to support a million or so people indefinitely, or even several thousand if they were of a bit of techno-primitivist bent. 

These being effectively low-grade space ships you could set your course for deep space and leave other people behind if you found the core civilization too undesirable to share space with. 

Nor do you have to build it all at once. 

You start with a small cylinder and either make it longer with time or just add more cylinders. 

You could even drag in mostly empty prefabricated ones and arrange them outside the asteroid then just build a thin shell around the whole thing and disassemble the asteroid for exterior shielding and fill dirt for the habs. 

In terms of how many of these we can make in our solar system that all just depends on how thick you want your dirt, since again you can use hydrogen as your real exterior shielding. 

If you disassembled all the rocky planets in the solar system to make habs with about 10 meters thick of dirt and hull you could get away with fabricating an amount of these equivalent to a few million Earth’s worth of living area. 

Less dirt, more living area, more dirt, less living area. 

If you’re using that dirt as your main source of food, rather than mostly hydroponics, a population a few million times our own, if not, if it’s really more for gardens and lawns and some dedicated habitats as wildlife preserves, than maybe a hundred times as dense. 

Okay, we’ve looked at the more plausible ones. 

Let’s close out by reviewing some of the bigger and often more famous designs. 

As I mentioned earlier if you’re working with metals like steel, or even titanium, you can just only make these things so wide. 

Once we discovered carbon nanotubes and graphene we set our sights a lot higher and came up with two called the Bishop Ring and the Mckendree Cylinder. 

These are things with circumferences on the order of a thousand miles, not just ten or so and they are big enough to nearly be considered planets of their own. 

Same concept as before, just bigger. 

But even before we discovered carbon nanotubes we already had two rather well known fictional examples. 

The smaller, more recent, and less well known of those first appeared in the late Ian M. 

Banks 1987 novel Consider Phlebas and we call it the Banks Orbital. 

What’s noteworthy about this ring is the rather specific spin rate. 

It rotates once every 24 hours. 

Meaning that if you turn it on its side facing the sun it will replicate our normal 24 hour day night cycle without needing artificial lighting or mirrors. 

You can even give it a little tilt to simulate seasons. 

Of course you need what we call an airwall many miles high to keep the air spill out of the thing but the object is so huge you’d barely even see those and you’d probably sculpt them as fake mountains. 

You get the same sky, day and night, as on a planet, and the horizon is so far off all the air in between would probably hide it so you just saw a thin bridge over head. 

In order to achieve that 24 hour spin rate and produce earth-like gravity the Banks Orbital has to be a very specific size. 

For any given planetary gravity and day length there is only one unique diameter that will work. 

An Earth Banks Orbital would be roughly 2 million miles in diameter, and it can be as wide as you want but the wider you make it the brighter your night sky since the sunlit side will glow. 

Even one just a thousand kilometers wide is going to make the nights brighter than a full moon. 

One that wide would have a couple hundred Earth’s worth of surface area though. 

Again you can make them wider but at the cost of brighter night time skies and since the nice thing about these is how closely they replicate Earth, since it’s already got a couple hundred time more living area than Earth, you might as well just build a second neighboring skinny one rather than make it wider. 

The obvious issue with building ones of these is the material stress. 

Nothing, not even Graphene, comes close to being strong enough not to be ripped to shreds. 

Nor could any type of molecule ever do it. 

In theory some sort of material like Neutronium, the loose concept for some material held together by the strong nuclear force that binds atomic nuclei together, could maybe pull it off but the usual method in science fiction is a handwave to force fields. 

The next and better known, and also older and larger design, is Larry Niven’s Ringworld. 

These are just under a hundred times wider in diameter than a Banks Orbital and wrap a star entirely. 

They require an even stronger material than a Banks Orbital does and since they always face the sun you have to put up shades to block the light that orbit at some spacing and rate to produce a 24-hour day. 

And that just has you go from high noon to midnight in short order, though you could get around that by making the edges of the shades translucent especially to red light, to mimic twilight. 

Banks Orbitals don’t have that issue, they have a natural day and night with regular old twilight and dawn. 

That’s one of the reasons why the concept is pretty popular even though it’s newer and smaller than the idea of a Ringworld. 

Otherwise they’re much alike, and much akin to the Bishop Ring. 

You have airwalls to keep your atmosphere in. 

Ringworlds can be arbitrarily wide too but usually we put the number at around a million earth’s worth of surface area or more. 

They have stability issue, and they’re spinning at nearly half a percent of light speed meaning you’ve really got to worry about debris hitting them, but realistically if you can build the thing in the first place those kinds of problems are pretty insignificant. 

Kinda like worrying about if you’ve got enough power outlets in the kitchen on an aircraft carrier, it matters but it’s just not that big a hurdle compared to floating a hundred thousand tons of steel on water. 

About the only thing the Banks Orbital has to worry about that a Ringworld doesn’t is tidal forces, the thing is big enough that the part near the sun gets yanked on more than the part farther from the sun but that’s not necessarily a bad thing since if give you tides, another thing rotating habitats wouldn’t have unless you brute forced it by having attached cisterns that pumped some water in and out of the habitat on appropriate times. 

Both of these are very popular designs but not really in the realm of currently plausible science. 

Amusingly it is typically in the realm of doable in most space operas and scifi like Star Trek which is one of the reasons why it often seems a bit strange the dudes are always squabbling over planets when they could just build these things instead. 

Back in the realm of plausible science, but similar immense in size, is another object popularized by Larry Niven that also showed up in one of Bank’s novels called a Topopolis. 

You might recall earlier I mentioned you could connect rotating habitats together at their ends like sausage links, this one goes one better and avoids some of the problems with that by just having one insanely long habitat that doesn’t resemble a ring, or cylinder, or even a skinny pencil but is more like a giant spool of wire. 

And you just wrap it around a star as many times as you want, or if it isn’t solar powered, around whatever you want like some gas giant you’re mining for the hydrogen to fuel the fusion reactors to light the giant thing. 

It could be steel, some miles in diameter, or graphene, some hundreds of miles in diameter, and arbitrarily long until you ran out of raw materials to build it anyway. 

There’s literally no difference between them and the shorter O’Neill or McKendree Cylinders. 

No tricky engineering or anything like that. 

They’ve not show up much in fiction though, which has always surprised me. 

Personally I always like to think of them having some super long river running down the whole length for millions or billions of miles. 

Even though all these things can only be built by high tech, often clarketech, civilizations they always seem to make people think of them as inhabited by lower tech civilizations of more of a fantasy than science fiction bent. 

Medieval not high-tech, and I’m not really an exception, the Topopolis is rather neat for the option of being one giant coastline of port cities. 

The Topopolis is as big as it gets for rotating habitats that are a single piece and don’t require inventing new science, but they’re not the end of the story. 

Earlier I showed a couple ways of linking these things together in groups and it might have occurred to you at the time that a direct connection like that has some problems. 

The most obvious being if you connect a spinning cylinder to a sphere that isn’t spinning with it you’re going to start leaking air or have gears grinding on each other or both. 

That’s a serious issue with the classic rotating habitat exposed to void but there’s two work arounds. 

The first is a plasma window or similar technology, that I discussed in the last video as way to keep air from leaking into evacuated tunnels at the end of launch loops. 

It can work the opposite way too, keeping air from leaving pressurized tunnels. 

The second we’ll touch on in a moment. 

First let me hit on one point, if you’re connecting multiple cylinders at the same junction then that junction really can’t be spinning to produce gravity itself, another reason you’d probably taper these cylinders near the end so that gravity ebbed off slowly for those entering the spheres. 

You could however fill them with air just fine so birds could fly through. 

In theory land critters could learn to maneuver in zero gravity and you could line the edge with easily gripped, or clawed, materials and arrange a constant outward air pressure to blow things back against the sides of the sphere. 

That doesn’t help sea life if you want fish to be able to migrate between habs though and we do often think about using rotating habs as a way of making truly protected wildlife reserves so overcoming that is worth consideration. 

You’d almost have to have two big pipes running out of each hab with pressure pushing water in through the one and out though the other so things could swim between, but it could be done and could also work in tandem with faking some tides and currents. 

Rotating habitats aren’t really ideal for deeps seas either but you also really don’t need much gravity for marine life, just enough to make sure stuff goes the right way so slower spinning habs mostly full of salt water and much deeper is an option, with the lower apparent gravity the pressure rises slower too and so they can be much deeper. 

If you saw the rogue planets video and remember me mentioning the idea of vertical reefs this would be another applicable cases. 

You’re always going to want a nice supply of reserve water and water is very plentiful in this universe, so you might prefer to put it to use as an ecological niche rather than just as a protective ice sheath for habitats. 

That protective sheath brings us back to our other fix for leaking air and water. 

Remember that our spinning cylinders are not exposed to outer space directly. 

They have a non-rotating exterior layer around them. 

That can be welded right onto the junction sphere, nice and air tight. 

If it isn’t rotating then you can just let a bit of leakage occur where the rotating section meets the connecting junction sphere because you can pump that back to near vacuum. 

Running a vacuum pump in gap between the rotating section and the stationary sheath, and adding a bit more spin to the cylinder to make up for a bit of loss to air drag in the near vacuum, is fairly energy intensive but it doesn’t even get into the ballpark of the kinds of power needed to light and heat these things normally, and all that drag and pumping would end as heat anyway. 

So with those exterior sheaths we don’t need to worry much about leaks where moving parts connect and that increases our options. 

We can do more than long sausage chains or even fairly two dimensional layouts and go for 3D. 

So long as you taper the cylinders down before jamming them into a junction sphere you can cram them together fairly tightly and these junctions spheres with no gravity of their own don’t need to be very large and they can also have exterior access to actual space through the usual airlock mechanisms. 

You can, from the 2D angle, lay yourself out wide mesh grids like ribbons and fill the gap in between with solar panels if you either don’t have fusion or want to take advantage of the free supply in a sun. 

This is one of the ways you can go about creating a Dyson Sphere, or Partial Dyson Sphere if your raw materials run out, by just wrapping these ribbons all the way around a star then doing another ribbon cocked at a different angle and so on, until you have a sphere. 

Unlike the Ringworld they only need to be moving at normal solar orbital speeds because they get their entire gravity from spinning locally, rather than around the entire star. 

Such combined structures, possessing thousands if not millions of times as much living room as a planet, let you get away with devoting whole planets worth of space to things like natural habitats for all the flora and fauna we have here on Earth while still devoting the super majority of it to human-centric interests. 

It’s also a lot easier to protect a rotating habitat from invasive species or careless campers. 

Taken as a whole, as we close out for the day, rotating habitats offer us the advantage of millions of times more space than we’d ever get just terraforming planets and are doable inside the laws of known science. 

Plus as we’ve seen they can be made very comfortable to mankind and quite safe and secure, arguably a lot more than planets are. 

Unlike planets you can choose your own day length and temperature and climate and gravity, and while as we saw in the terraforming video there are ways to do that with other worlds too it’s a heck of a lot easier with these sorts of constructs. 

This is, fundamentally, why many of think that vast swaths of rotating habitats are more likely in mankind’s future than endless terraformed worlds. 

So this concludes all the prepwork we needed to finally get to the video on interstellar colonization. 

Once we finish that up we’ll be returning to the megastructures series to look at another type of artificial world, this time with real gravity, in Shell Worlds, and from there probably move on to the slightly more fantastic Discworlds. 

Our next stop on the habitable planets series is going to be a look at Double Planets.

Habitable Planets 4: Life on Rogue Planets
---
  
2015-11-28  
https://youtu.be/gOu3zGfP-TQ  

---

So today we’ll be continuing our Habitable Planets series with a discussion of Rogue Planets. If you’ve just jumped into the series by starting with this video, you might want to go back and see the first one on Dwarf Planets before watching this as much of the material in that video relates to this one. 

Also, like all the links that will pop up in these videos with the yellow or white boxes around them, you can just click on it and it will pause this video and open that one in a new window. Similarly if you’re new to the channel you should probably turn on the closed captions, I’m easier to understand with subtitles on. 

So, let’s begin with the obvious… what is a Rogue Planet? 

In a nutshell Rogue Planets are objects that were either ejected from their native solar system or formed entirely in interstellar space, so technically they’re not planets at all. That’s not new for this series though, we started by looking at dwarf planets like Pluto, and last time we looked at large moons. Only one of our videos in this series has actually revolved around a classic planet. And that will continue to be the norm for this series because, to put it simply, regular old planets around regular old suns is terribly boring. Now it has been over a century and a half since Darwin published and we still don’t know how abiogenesis originally occurred. 

The leading scientific candidates are hydrothermal vents, tidal pools, and panspermia in basically that order but we don’t really know because we can’t see the process in action and unsurprisingly it is rather tricky to hunt for evidence from billions of years ago. Truth be told, all three of those options might allow abiogenesis or none of them might and we need a new theory. 

But it does seem plausible that however it occurred here on Earth it probably can occur on planets a lot like our own around stars a lot like our own. Similarly, if you’ve watched the Terraforming video, you know that colonizing any planet is a major undertaking but the more like Earth it is the easier it is. So looking at how life might originate on Earth-like planets or how we might colonize them just isn’t all that interesting. 

In this series we’re interested in the hard cases, the abnormalities. The places that don’t seem like life could occur on them or wouldn’t seem like places we’d want to make our home. Rogue Planets at first glance are a practically the epitome of that. Icy cold worlds without a speck of sunlight, totally inhospitable to life. But on second glance, they might be a lot more hospitable than they initially look, both as a source of life, and as a place we might want to colonize. Indeed for the latter, for colonization, as we’ll see in the upcoming Interstellar Colonization video, they may be the most valuable real estate around and the keystone of us getting out among the stars. Another thing to keep in mind is that Rogue Planet is a very broad territory. When we use it, we’re not really talking about Earth-sized objects, which are a narrow and special though interesting case we’ll look at sometimes called Steppenwolf Planets. We really mean just about anything from a decent sized asteroid up to gas giant bigger than Jupiter that might have its own moon. 

Essentially we mean any object out in the interstellar void, and that’s a big category, tons of things would fall within it with nothing more in common than being decently large and devoid of sunlight. Once you get away from a sun’s light, the energy to power life has to come from something else. And life needs a power source. Now back in the first video, when discussing Pluto, we pointed out a couple of these, as well as some alternative chemistries life might use besides how we do it on Earth. 

For power we have Tidal heating from a moon, and rogue planets can have moons, they could acquire some while wandering out of their solar system or picking one up in deep space, and they have decent odds of keeping their original one too. Tidal heating can be a very powerful energy source especially when not eclipsed by sunlight. 

Nuclear isotopes like uranium down in the core of a world providing heat is an option. 

Gravitational contraction generating heat is too, for larger objects like Gas Giants. 

None of these provide much power though, and that matters because even though you could have a warm planet far from a sun, it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s power for life. 

Life can’t thrive just because a place is warm, it needs incoming energy. There’s life that lives in subterranean caverns here on Earth for instance, but it’s very diffuse, way less biomass than the surface has, usually slow metabolism creatures and plants too. 

Unexposed to the sun, such life has to live mostly off the waste of the solar-powered ecosystems above or the trickles of energy available from things like thermal vents or chemicals which it can metabolize for energy. Photosynthesis is the way we get really dense life, and that’s mostly off the table for Rogue Planets. I say mostly, not entirely, because objects do give off photons at a rate and wavelength connected to their temperature and we have found not only organisms that live off the heat and chemicals coming out of hydrothermal vents but also some organisms, like some types of Green Sulfur Bacteria, that can live of the light too. Infrared light, especially the Mid-IR range often known as thermal light, is not going to give you super-abundant growth either but it does add one more power source to our pool. Energy available for life does need to be a steady source, and the more the better. But even on a decent-sized asteroid you could have chunks of uranium in the core decaying and giving off heat that emerged from cracks into pockets of mineral rich water and that’s basically the same condition that you have for Earth’s own ocean smokers that are the lead candidate for abiogenesis of life on Earth. Ditto, as I mentioned, there wouldn’t be anything strange about two rogues being in orbit of each other and giving us tidal heating, as we discussed in the video on tidal locking. You could also have pockets of radioactive material right inside or near our underground pockets of mineral rich water acting as natural nuclear fission reactors, we’ve seen this even on earth. Groundwater seeps into places with dense uranium deposits and acts as a neutron moderator, just as in our own fission plants, increasing power output of those deposits beyond natural decay. 

You could never really expect these methods to produce abundant life and rich ecosystems comparable to what normal photosynthesis powered ecosystems here on Earth have, so probably no chance for large quantities of complex animals that might develop into a technological civilization, but it does appear possible you could have life naturally occur on them. 

Now the next to keep in mind, looking at rogue planets, is they probably wouldn’t be large rocks in the void. Earth has very little hydrogen and helium, and even other gases are pretty thin and rare, because the sun strips atmospheres off planets as we discussed in the Terraforming video. There is ionizing radiation in deep space, but not much of it, and no regular light to warm the planet’s surface to make atmosphere stripping easier. 

So any object in the void is likely to acquire a lot of interstellar gas. If you’ve got miles deep layers of hydrogen and helium surrounding your world that makes for one heck of an insulating blanket and strongly implies the possibility of oceans on those rogue planets. 

Just taking the example of a rogue gas giant with moons, like Titan and Europa, places we already consider possible candidates for life, very little of their mechanics rely on the sun. Titan has a thick nitrogen atmosphere also strong in methane that’s warmed largely by rotating around Saturn, Europa is a large ocean crusted over with ice that’s also tidally heated by Jupiter. If life could evolve on either, then it could evolve on parallel worlds in the interstellar void just as easily. What about Earth-like planets? 

In fact let’s consider what would happen if Earth and its moon were ejected from our solar system. Needless to say such an ejection combined with the loss of light would kill nearly all, if not all, life on Earth. Though it would take a long time for some of it to die and some might not die at all. There’s a lot of heat on Earth and the cooler you get, the slower you radiate heat away. What’s more as the planet cools the oceans freeze over and begin making an insulating blanket that traps heat in the deep ocean. By that point all the water is frozen on the surface but the air is still around, nitrogen and oxygen don’t liquefy till you get a good bit colder. But under the ice sheet all the heat trapped in the core and mantle of the planet from years past and that which is still being produced by radioactive materials in the core are keeping the deep oceans warm and leaking out through warmer hydrothermal vents where life will continue. We’d also still be getting tidal heating off our own moon to further warm things and stir the pot. Now eventually that atmosphere will liquefy too, the heat produced by our planet’s core is only around a three-thousandth of what we get from the sun and keeping in mind that fourth-power rule of heat radiation we’d expect the temp to drop to about the fourth power of three thousand less than now. Which is about 7 or 8 times cooler, somewhere around 40 Kelvin which is cold enough for nitrogen and oxygen and argon to liquefy but not quite cold enough for hydrogen to liquefy. Pretty close but not quite, and helium takes even far lower temperatures. 

So as Earth drifted out into the void we’d start collecting hydrogen and helium gas as a new atmosphere, very slowly but it would begin to accumulate and we’d also nab us some comets and other stuff. If we get enough it might even create high enough pressures and temperatures under that new atmosphere to turn the nitrogen and oxygen back into air. So you’ve got a water ocean under the ice, and possibly a second ocean of liquid oxygen and nitrogen on top of that, and an increasingly thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere over that. Planets significantly bigger than Earth will be even warmer, while smaller ones will be colder, but we’d expect just about any object large enough to get dubbed a planet to act this way. 

These sorts of worlds are sometimes known as Steppenwolf Planets, or Steppenworlds, for their comparison to a lone wolf, and would specifically be any planets with a mass from a little less than a third of Earth’s to a little over triple Earth’s mass. These planets would have an insulating layer of ice and carbon dioxide snow and whatever else they picked up touring the lonely void to allow sub-surface liquid oceans heated by geothermal activity coming up through hydrothermal vents. 

Now we can’t be sure of Steppenwolf planets – which are rogue planets with subsurface oceans – because we can’t really predict too well how thick that ice would end up being on a given planet. Ice will grow from the surface down until it reaches equilibrium with the heat coming from the mantle, but that is going to vary a lot from world to world and our best guess is for Earth it would be nearly a kilometer deep, for smaller worlds it could be several miles and the dynamic gets further messed up if depending on whether most of heat transport is occurring by convection or conduction. 

These Steppenwolf Planets are our main interest today because life on smaller planets, essentially icy dwarfs or asteroids, is another subject we’ve already partially addressed or wouldn’t be much different in the case of an asteroid from it being in our own belt or in deep space. 

Ditto Gas Giants themselves, rather than their moons, will be looked at later in the series. 

There’s pretty good odds Steppenwolf planets decently larger than Earth would have deeper oceans, and would actually get more radioactive heating. After all, a planet of similar makeup and density to Earth but, say, twice as massive would have twice the radioactive heating and twice the water but only 60% more surface area for that water to be on and for heat to escape from. Super-Earth Steppenwolf planets might be able to support fairly robust underwater ecosystems, albeit rather anemic compared to our own ocean life, even the deep sea life which on Earth gains a second power source from organic matter sinking down from higher levels that are fed by sunlight. And there might be a lot of these worlds, some estimates right now place the number of rogue planets, objects ranging from as small bigger moons like Europa and Titan, up to Super-Jupiters, may number around 100,000 per every star. Meaning there’d be more a lot more of them then objects of a similar size in our own solar system which is only in the area of around a hundred, not a hundred thousand. This doesn’t even include smaller objects, like asteroids, which we might expect to be even more common. But if for the moment we assumed this estimate was right and those were fairly evenly distributed in space, these object would only be spaced a few light weeks apart. A long cry from the light hours spacing of our on mid to outer solar system, but a lot closer than the few light years between other solar systems. Now if you start tossing in asteroids, well there around a million asteroids a mile across or bigger just in our asteroid belt, more than a thousand times as common as the various planets and larger moons we have, and if that ratio held up you’d expect interstellar space, where planets might be common enough to appear every few light weeks, to be as common as every light day or two. 

We’ll talk more about making rocks like that livable in the future, though if you saw the video on Fusion you can take a guess as to how, but this will be an important point when we get to the Interstellar Colonization video since it means solar systems are not lonely islands in space years away from the nearest neighbor but really more like cities dotting a vast perpetual plain of rural land. Now getting back to Steppenwolf Planets, the ones of a mass and internal composition fairly close to Earth, we’ve seen that they aren’t too bad of places for life to maybe emerge on, but like we’ve discussed in the case of Pluto, not places you’d expect life to be abundant on if it exists at all. 

How could we change that? 

How would we colonize a place like that? 

Well again if you’ve seen the fusion video you know we’d have the option to just manually light the place. I mentioned in that video that to light a square mile of land artificially like Earth terrain normally gets would require around 10^16 Joules a year or about ten kilograms of fusion fuel – hydrogen or deuterium, both of which are quite common in deep space. 

To light an entire planet the size of Earth as well as our sun does, to fake a sun, would require a lot more juice, something like five or six megatons of fusion fuel a year. Which sounds like a lot, but for comparison, if that planet had a hydrogen atmosphere of the same mass as Earth’s, which is about 5 billion megatons of air, then you’d have a billion year supply just from that. Not to mention all the hydrogen in the oceans, and our ocean is roughly a thousand times more massive than our atmosphere. So if we stuck a fake sun in orbit around the world, say, orbiting every 24 hours and shining down in a beam like a flashlight, sort of like a geocentric model where the sun orbits the planet, you could run that as long as a normal star lived, and a normal planet lived, without putting a very big dent in your local supply of fuel. 

Of course if you’re colonizing a Steppenwolf Planet you might not want to go that route. 

You might instead decide to keep it frozen and just stick some submersible fusion plants in the ocean, trailing strings of lights, and introducing photosynthetic organisms into it. You could even do something like this on Earth, if you wanted the great ocean depths to have more life in them. Just stick a floating fusion plant somewhere and flush all the cooling water down along pipes with photosynthetic optimized LED lights running down far beneath the sun’s reach. Especially if you added in some meshes to collect minerals and detritus you could end up with long gorgeous vertical coral reefs harboring huge amounts of marine life. Even if the planet already had life, down near the bottom where the hydrothermal vents were, you could attach your cities to the ice up top and slowly melt it till it was just a fairly thin layer of ice a few hundred meters thick. Then in those new upper regions you could attach strings which provided light and aerated the water and introduce earth marine life, the detritus of which could sink to the depths and help fuel the native ecology. Done properly the two could be kept separate and safe while allowing two ecosystems thrive, with the original one now much more robust. 

I’m not sure how practical that is compared to other colonization routes, but personally I find the idea of leviathan depths with trailing lights providing an oasis of life pretty neat. 

So that’s going to wrap it up for Rogue Planets for now. We’ll look at how the smaller and likely more common Rogue Asteroids might be made habitable in the upcoming video on Rotating Habitats in our Megastructures Series, then talk about the importance of Rogue Planets to interstellar expansion and civilization in the Upcoming video on Interstellar Colonization.

The Impact of Nuclear Fusion

https://youtu.be/8Pmgr6FtYcY

The scheduled video I’m supposed to be doing right now is on Rogue Planets, followed by discussing Rotating Habitats and Interstellar Colonization. I’ve gotten quite delayed on those in large part because there is a common thread in all of those that really needs to be addressed first and that’s how we power these things. Running Spaceships, powering artificial habitats or giant launch loops, or terraforming planets takes up a lot of energy and that isn’t something we have an abundance of these days. 

So if you’re one of my regular subscribers, sorry, but this needs discussed first. 

If you’re not one of my regular subscribers and this is the first video you’re watching then you’re probably noticing I sound a touch strange, that’s my speech impediment, and you might want to turn on the closed caption which is down near the subscribe button. Subtitles help and even discounting the speech impediment I do have to toss out a lot of more arcane technical terms in these videos you might not be too familiar with. 

Also if you’re new to these videos I will occasionally reference other videos and that will typically be accompanied by a thumbnail on the screen with a yellow or white box around it, you can click those at anytime and it will just pause this video and open that one in a new window. A common theme in a lot of these videos has been where you get the power to do all these neat things like throw up an orbital ring up around your planet or terraform another planet. I like to discuss some of the ways this can be done without a revolutionary new power supply but I tend to mention how useful nuclear fusion would be if we had that. I’ve never really gone into that in detail before though, and while there are a lot of videos out there discussing how nuclear fusion would work, they don’t tend to really discuss the full weight of the sort of economic impact a functional fusion reactor would have. Fusion’s also gotten a bit of a bad reputation as the technology that’s 20 years away, and always will be, one not helped by a lot of over-hyped alleged cold fusion inventions. People are dubious about, weirdly more so than something like faster-than-light travel which we outright tell people is scientifically impossible. So I like to explain how a lot of the ideas discussed on this channel can be done without it. Fusion is a huge gamechanger if you’ve got it, but it’s not absolutely necessary for us to expand out into the stars and I don’t want people to think all is lost if we don’t have this cool piece of tech. 

Today we’re going to skip over the skepticism. We’re also going to skip over the mechanism for doing fusion. We’ve got a number of different reactor designs all coming at fusion from different angles and none work yet so detailing those, especially when there are videos that discuss them already, would seem pointless. I will explain the oldest design real quick, the one that works and we’ve always known would work, just to dispel some skepticism. But before doing that here’s the 60-second overview of what nuclear fusion is and how it differs from nuclear fission. 

Nuclear Fusion, which is what powers the stars themselves, is the process of slamming lots of light elements like hydrogen, or hydrogen’s main isotope, deuterium, together until they form a heavier element like helium, or slamming helium together to make carbon. 

This process releases a lot of energy because while deuterium is one neutron, proton, and electron each, and carbon is six neutrons, protons, and electrons each, 6 deuterium atoms weighs noticeably more than one carbon atom. All that missing mass was converted into other stuff, neutrinos and high energy photons, and we can use those photons to make power. 

Fusion fuses together lighter elements into heavier elements and releases energy doing so. A lot of energy, millions of time more energy than an equal weight of gasoline or coal or ethanol. 

Fission does it backwards, taking big heavy elements like uranium and turning them into smaller ones, releasing energy while doing that. Fusion produces more energy than fission does, and there’s a lot more hydrogen, deuterium, and helium out there in the Universe then Uranium. So it’s a better power source. The problem with doing fusion is it requires incredible heat and pressure to make it work, which is hard to maintain in a lab without spending way more energy then you get out of the process and also wrecks your equipment. 

That’s why cold fusion is always such an attractive idea, though it doesn’t look to be in the cards. It’s also why fusion bombs are doable, because you are creating one big immense blast and don’t care if your reactor is shredded to atomic dust in the process. And that brings up the one known form of man-made fusion we do have, the original one, the H-Bomb or Fusion Bomb. This device is also the reason why we have that irritating quip about how fusion is the technology of the future and always will be. We went from a basic understanding of atoms to the fission bomb and fission power plant in about one generation. We then got the fusion bomb only 7 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some jumped the gun thinking we’d progress as fast and have fusion on the same timeline, that turned out not to be true and scientists stopped saying it was soon ahead for some decades, now they are saying it again. 

Fusion isn’t a certainty, and I certainly won’t say it’s just twenty years off, but for my part I’m very optimistic we’ll crack the problem in the future and I genuinely would not be surprised at this point if we did have commercial fusion reactors in twenty or thirty years. But I mentioned not just a working fusion bomb but also a working fusion reactor that we’ve always had. And I don’t mean the sun. Simply put, you can build a fusion reactor just by building yourself a very large, mile wide, insulated and sturdy bunker full of water and with turbines on top. You then dump in a fusion bomb and let it go off. That heats the water, produces steam, turns turbine, makes power. You dump another in when you’re done. That’s it, and its always been doable. 

You dump a multi- megaton nuclear device into a big hardened water-filled sphere a few miles across once every hour and you’ve got all the power you need to run an entire industrialized continent. This isn’t really a terribly enticing way to go, H-bombs even without the expensive rockets aren’t cheap and a structure like that would make the Hoover Dam look like a Lego Project. But I offer it as a known way to do fusion power. Let’s assume we get something smaller going. 

Forget the method, just assume we have one. There’s still two types for our interest, compact and high powered versions, and large low powered versions. This isn’t about efficiency but power produced per kilogram of the total reactor and fuel and the breaking point where we’re concerned would be whether or not you can make one powerful enough to lift itself and some payload into orbit. It’s like a solar panel, most solar panels can produce a billion or so joules per kilogram of their own mass per year, and live for a decade or so. Conservatively. That’s ten billion plus joules of energy per kilogram of panel. That’s a few hundred times more energy per kilogram than gasoline or rocket fuel have. But it does that over a decade, and so you can’t make a solar powered launch vehicle, it just isn’t powerful enough to get into space where you need expend all that energy in a few minutes not ten years. Same is true for a nuclear fission plant, of course uranium produces way more power per kilogram than solar panels or fossil fuels, and it’s still high even when you start adding in all the radiation shielding and power generation ability. A nuclear Fission Plant can’t just fire out steam from the bottom and lift itself into orbit. A nuclear fusion reactor may or may not produce enough power, which is energy per unit time, to lift itself into orbit even though it would easily produce far more energy over its lifetime than was necessary to get into orbit. I refer to any hypothetical fusion reactor that could as a compact one. And if you’ve got one, hey, great, but if you don’t you still have options like space elevators and orbital rings or launch loops powered by fusion to get the job done of getting stuff off planet. Once you’re off planet it doesn’t matter if the fusion reactor, or fusion drive, is particularly powerful since a very slow acceleration for hours or days is just as good as a fast acceleration that runs out of fuel in a couple minutes. That’s why ion drives look nice in space but are useless for getting into orbit, they produce a lot of higher final speed than a classic rocket but take a long time to do it. For interstellar travel, or even interplanetary travel, taking a long while to get up to and back down from your top speed isn’t that big a deal. And if you’re curious the usual assumed speed for what we call a fusion torch drive is around 10% of light speed, the approximate maximum you could get up to if you need to carry your fuel to speed up and slow down. But we’ll talk about that another day. What we need to look at now is what fusion actually does for an economy. First, while it isn’t an infinite power supply its one that produces energy from the most common substances in the Universe, and produces many millions of times more energy per gallon or pound than gasoline or coal. It takes several supertankers worth of oil to run the US economy every day, where as one supertanker full of fusion fuel would run the US economy for several thousand years. That matters a lot when we’re talking about some kind of deep space settlement too far from the sun to use solar power because it means that even if they needed to import their fuel, rather than just sucking it out of the local thin gas floating around, they could keep millions of years worth of supply to run their habitat in an area much smaller than that habitat. And in a bit we’ll actually run some numbers to show how much energy, or weight in fusion fuel be it normal hydrogen or deuterium, it would take to keep someone alive and comfortable for one century, a nice long human life, including energy to grow their food. 

But let’s talk about a more near term effect. We know cheap electricity from nuclear fission, let alone fusion, is very handy but it doesn’t help much for cars. You can’t build a fission reactor into a car, no seriously the Thorium car is so much absolute bullcrap. You can build in batteries but our batteries stink, should they ever get much better than solar becomes a nicer option too. But if they don’t, and you’ve got fusion, then you’ve got all the gasoline you ever want and without worrying about filling your atmosphere with carbon dioxide. Why is that? 

Well fossils fuels and other hydrocarbons are great power supplies because when you expose them to oxygen at high temperatures they burn and break from being a hydrocarbon into being water – hydro – and carbon dioxide while releasing heat energy. You can run this process backwards and cram water and carbon dioxide together to get hydrocarbons and oxygen back. This first process produces energy, the second process sucks it up, and in truth sucks up a lot more energy to run backwards then you’d get out from burning it again. There’s no super-science to doing this, it’s easy old chemistry, it’s just pointless right now. But if you have a basically infinite supply of power at your giant fusion reactor who cares if it takes a billion joules of energy to produce one gallon of gas with a mere 132 million joules of energy. Your average AAA battery costs, say, around a buck, not much less than a gallon of gas does, but contains not even one thousandth of the energy in that gas, and way more energy is lost recharging a battery than stays inside it. But it’s still worth it for its portability. If you’ve got cheap fusion, then you’ve got an unlimited supply of cheap hydrocarbon fuel and carbon neutral fuel because you make it by just sucking the carbon and water right back out of the air. Now if you’ve got batteries that are more energy dense than fossil fuels you wouldn’t bother but we don’t have those yet either, and batteries generally leak power too, way faster than a tank of a gasoline does. Nor if you’ve got cheap fusion do you just have cheap power and fuel. You’ve also got cheap fertilizer. The nitrogen we use as our main fertilizer is mostly produced from ammonia produced by the Haber-Bosch process. With cheap electricity you can electrolyze water for its hydrogen and suck nitrogen from the air to produce ammonia. We talked about this a lot in the terraforming video, in terms of transmuting local substances into things we can breathe and drink. 

So you can make nitrogen fertilizer very cheap. Ditto for phosphorus, our other main fertilizer, you can get cheaper supplies of it. Phosphorus doesn’t occur naturally in dense and easily mined chunks in many places so its expensive and scarce, but if you’ve got cheap energy you can separate it from low-density supplies in a number of energy-expensive but simple methods, even something as low tech as a centrifuge. And that applies to any mineral, even if you ignore that you could mine asteroids economically if you’ve got fusion. 

Recycling of almost anything becomes way cheaper and easier as well. 

Ditto water. We always have water shortages on a planet whose surface is more water than land because it’s all undrinkable salt-water but with cheap power you can desalinate water cheap enough for agricultural purposes. You can’t have a drought because you never run out of water and you’ve got cheap power to irrigate fields with. You’ve got cheap, carbon-neutral plastics or polycarbon sheets to make greenhouses, which seriously cut water usage and keep warmer temperatures, but you can also heat them since you have cheap power. 

So you gain all the deserts and tundras as growing space and more efficient growing space since greenhouses loaded up with warm temps and cheap fertilizer produce orders of magnitude more food than old fashioned pre-industrial farming. 

But it doesn’t end there. You’ve probably heard of vertical farming, the notion of growing food in multiple layers. Now this idea, outside of over-hyped popsci articles, normally only calls for a couple layers because while plants don’t use most of the sunlight that hits their area they don’t use so little of it you can stack layers of growth dozens high, and skyscrapers are way more expensive per square foot then normal buildings which are vastly more expensive than cheap greenhouses which are more expensive than just normal land. But someone inevitably points out you could light your skyscraper vertical farms, especially with modern super-efficient LEDs. That’s true, except that the energy needed for that is hugely expensive compared to other routes of getting more calories per energy and effort put in. Of course if you’ve got cheap fusion, that’s no longer true and takes us to our next point. 

When we talk about vertical farming, or underground farming, or growing food hydroponically on space stations or spaceships we need to know how much energy it take to produce a calorie, actually a kilocalorie, of human edible food. Or for simplicity’s sake, the amount of food one person needs for one year. Now that’s a bit tricky to estimate with great accuracy, so I will be using very rounded numbers in the name of simplicity rather than high accuracy. That said let’s start with the very old school cases. Back in our hunter gatherer days it took roughly one square mile of land to feed a person. That’s all powered by the sun. That works out to 10^16 joules of solar energy, back in medieval times a 20 acre farm could feed a family decently and that’s about 100 times more land efficient, in the vicinity of 10^14 joules of energy per person per year. Fusion usually operates at about 1% of total mass conversion, the E=MC squared thingy, which is about 10^17 joules per kilogram for total conversion or about 10^15 for fusion conversion. Meaning for hunter gatherers you need about ten kilograms of fusion fuel a year per person for all that sunlight and for pre-industrial cultures more like a tenth of a kilogram, something akin to a shot glass full. 

At this scale, any other power concerns are totally dwarfed because while the average US citizen uses a few hundred billion joules of energy a year to run all our stuff, the equivalent of a couple thousand gallons of gas, that’s less than one gram of fusion fuel. What about modern agriculture? 

Hydroponics? 

What about tailored light by LEDs to only use that minimum amount of energy? 

Plants mostly use red light and don’t use more than a small fraction of noon-time sunlight. 

It’s hard to be too precise but if you really trim it down you’ll find you need a space only about the size of a living room or large bedroom stacked a few layers high with plants trays using up around 10 kilowatts of power to feed one person, and you can even go a bit lower, down to just a few kilowatts, but that 10 kilowatts figure is about on par with your energy consumption for other things working out to a few hundred billion joules a year. 

But we also like to have meat and some other stuff like green lawns or shared parks so I usually put the annual human power consumption at the nice rounded up figure of one trillion joules a year, or one gram of fusion fuel. Incidentally I keep calling it fusion fuel because we still don’t know what we can use. Plain old vanilla hydrogen would be ideal, as the most common substance in the Universe, but our focus now in research is on various isotopes of hydrogen and helium like deuterium which is still insanely common but nowhere near as abundant as plain old vanilla hydrogen. They fuse easier, gotta walk before you run. 

But what this means is, regardless of your fusion fuel, one gram a year ought to keep a person quite comfortable even on some deep space habitat so far from the sun it just looks like any star in the sky. One kilogram of that fuel would keep a man in very luxurious comfort for his whole natural life. And ten tons of that fuel a year would keep a place like Yosemite National Park naturally sunlit for a year. So you could build some large rotating habitat with a fake sun as a wildlife preserve running for nearly a decade on what a semi tractor trailer or the a space shuttle could bring in one trip. 

Yosemite is comparable in size to your average US county, with its average hundred thousand citizens, or to a large O’Neill cylinder. Those being closed environments where you have all the power you want to recycle raw materials, just some supertanker-sized fuel carrier inbound from Jupiter, which is nothing but fusion fuel, would bring enough to run such a place for thousands of years. Remember that because we’ll reference it more in future videos, one measly kilogram of the most abundant material in the Universe will keep a person in luxurious lifestyle for a natural lifetime with room to spare. 

So that’s what we’re talking about when we talk about the real impact of fusion power and why it’s so desirable. It’s not about your electricity bill dropping while ending our reliance on a finite supply of fossil fuels and the problems associated to burning them, it’s about a total paradigm shift in terms of scarcity of resources and the maximum population you can comfortably support. And this is a shift that’s even bigger than the invention of the bow and arrow, and early agriculture, and the green revolution all wrapped up into one. So that’s it for today, next time we will be talking about Rogue Planets like we were supposed to be doing today, and you’ll know why I seem to think something like that not only can but would be desirable to colonize, then we’ll move on to reviewing Rotating Habitats in more detail, after that we’ll finally leap into Interstellar Colonization and why so many of the assumptions about that which we have change when we think of them in the context of a fusion based economy.

Terraforming Techniques

Today we’ll be looking at a number of concepts in terraforming, the field which looks at how to make other worlds more hospitable to humans and other Earth life by making those worlds more Earth-like. 

If you’re a subscriber to the channel you probably know the videos on the channel fall into two basic categories… the long ones… and the incredibly long ones. 

This one is going to be of the second type, because it is a long subject, so now probably would be a good time to grab a drink and a snack. 

Also if you’re not a subscriber to the channel, you can become one just by clicking the subscribe button in the lower right corner, and while you’re down there you probably want to turn on the closed captions for the video. 

I can be a bit hard to understand even when I’m not spouting technical terms and we will have a lot of those in this video. 

Since this is a summary video I will be including both some links to other sources expanding on the subject in the video description as well as referencing some other videos by myself and others, these we will usually appear as thumbnail with a yellow box around them, most will appear again at the end of the video but you can click on these any time and it should just pause this video and open that one in another window. 

Just as an example, while we’ll talk about Mars a great deal in this video it’s not our real focus and if you’re interested in the nuts and bolts of getting to Mars and starting terraforming with only modern technology Shaun Moss’s “The International Mars Research Station” is definitely a good place to get started, and the attached video of his TED talk is a great introduction to getting to Mars. 

Another person I’ll be referencing a lot is Martyn J. Fogg, and if there’s anyone who knows more about terraforming them him I haven’t met them. 

A link to his website on terraforming is below in the video description and he literally wrote the book on the subject. 

We also all tend to hang around the same online forums discussing these kind of subjects, so while I’ll try as always to answer any questions you have in the comments section you may want to give those a try too. 

They tend to be friendly stomping grounds for scientists, science fiction writers, hobbyists, and people just curious about the ideas. 

So one of the first things we need to discuss is ‘what is terraforming?’ The word is plain enough, terra forming, terra, Latin for Earth, or earth-forming. 

Historically it first popped up in a short story by Jack Williamson called ‘Collision Orbit’ back in Astounding Fiction in 1942. 

This was the same story that saw the first use of Anti-Matter in science fiction. 

Williamson also coined the term ‘genetic engineering’, and probably tops the list of greatest and most influential science fiction writers most people have sadly never heard of. 

In his story, the example of terraforming is an asteroid just over a mile across with an artificial gravity field in it, so originally it wasn’t a planet or even a large asteroid or moon. 

I stress that because ‘making a planet like Earth’ tends to be the concept and image most think with terraforming but it’s not limited to planets and hasn’t been since Day 1. 

Genetic engineering is of interest to us too because there’s an alternate approach to terraforming, or one used in tandem with it, sometimes called ‘bioforming’, and that’s where you aren’t changing the world to be more Earth like to support Earth life but changing Earth organisms to be able to live on an alien planet. 

Terraforming and Bioforming are two sides of the same coin in some respects, and often assumed to be used together. 

Still, you often have people very opposed to terraforming for wrecking an alien environment, inhabited or lifeless, or opposed to bioforming because it involves genetic engineering. 

This isn’t an ethics class though, and it also isn’t one on bioforming. 

Nor am I qualified to talk about it in real detail since I’m not a biologist, so we won’t be discussing it in detail. 

Another term in common usage is Planetary Engineering, a fairly straight forward term and in many ways better than terraforming since its maybe a bit more on the nose. 

You’re engineer planetsing for habitability by Earth life more than you’re trying to make the planet a close copy of Earth. 

You’ll also occasionally hear the term para-terraforming, and this usually means just building domes on a planet. 

If taken to the extreme, so that the entire planet is domed under, we call this a Worldhouse. 

Essentially a world-spanning greenhouse. 

Also paraterraforming is often used to reference the first steps in most terraforming processes, where you’re setting up small living areas like domes on Mars or floating cloud habitats on Venus to live in while you’re making the planet more livable. 

If you’ve seen my original Megastructures video or any of the follow ups discussing rotating habitats those are sometimes considered para-terraforming examples too, especially if embedded in something like an asteroid. 

They replicate the conditions on Earth much more closely than you could plausibly get on Mars for instance, because you can tailor them to whatever you want. 

‘Want’ is the key word there because not everyone considers certain differences between Earth and another world as important to fix. 

They might not care, for instance, if the gravity is a bit heavier or the day is 30 hours long. 

With rotating habitats you’re pretty much able to tailor everything, but even though the original example of terraforming in fiction was a small asteroid, building giant cylinder habitats inside asteroids normally isn’t considered terraforming so we’ll look at those more properly in the Megastructures videos. 

So Terraforming itself is a pretty simple concept, make a place more like Earth, but which factors are most important? 

In which ones is a close approximation to Earth okay? 

To a degree it’s an Eye of the Beholder, Your Mileage May Vary kind of thing, especially when it comes to setting which differences are priorities and how close to Earth is close enough. 

So what are the big differences that need to be changed to make a world like Earth? 

We’re not focused on Mars or Venus but let’s take a look at some of the key differences both have with Earth, in this chart. 

In some ways it’s a very Goldilocks, not too hot, not too cold issue, too much air, too little air, but for neither is it what we can breathe. 

You need to make them warmer or colder, so how do we do that? 

You need add breathable air and remove unbreathable air. 

How do we do that? 

Venus’s Gravity is just about right, Mars has a Day Length that’s just about right, but its gravity is too low and Venus’s Day Length is almost a year long. 

Can we change those? 

How? 

Can we even change things like gravity, or year length or a planet’s axial tilt? 

The simple answer is that any planet, any moon, any asteroid can be made very like Earth in most ways, how close depends on which quality we’re talking about, what tools we have, how much of the tools we have, and how stubbornly persistent we are at the goal. 

Even the most basic terraforming takes centuries and must take centuries, as we’ll see, even if you’ve got something really neat like near limitless energy or self-replicating robots. 

The good news is humanity has an impressive track record of being stubborn and has been known to spend whole centuries working on projects. 

From the pyramids and cathedrals to highway systems, canals, and walls, we have shown a willingness to dedicate massive resources and long term efforts to getting projects done, and we did most of those back when people lived about half as long as we do now and with far less excess wealth to devote to them. 

People often wonder if we’d be willing to devote centuries to projects like Terraforming and for my part, though I often get accused of excessive optimism, I think the answer is a clear yes. 

So let’s start by talking about those three most basic qualities a planet needs to have. 

The right temperature for life, the right atmosphere for life, and water. 

Water’s actually quite easy, on the surface anyway. 

It’s one of the most common molecules in the universe because its constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, are the first and third most common elements in the Universe and it’s a very simple molecule to form. 

Ironically in most cases it’s coming up with the Hydrogen, the most plentiful substance in the Universe, and not the Oxygen, which is the problem. 

Hydrogen tends to be a touch rare on rocky planets, as is helium, the second most common atom. 

The reason for this is simple enough. 

Planets we’re interested in are hot, and regularly hit by ionizing radiation, asteroids and other items that tend to help evaporate atmospheres into space. 

I’ve mentioned in the past that people tend to mistakenly assume places like Mars and our own moon have too little gravity to hold atmospheres, and we’ll talk about that briefly in a little bit, but the key thing is that the various means by which matter escapes from atmospheres, regardless of the various physical mechanism being used, relies very heavily on the mass of the molecule. 

Hydrogen and helium molecules are quite light and fly away quite easily. 

Hydrogen unlike helium can bind to other, heavier atoms to form heavy molecules so even though it’s lighter as an atom than helium it often remains in larger quantities. 

Still it will often find itself free from molecular bondage to heavier kindred, either paired up with another hydrogen atom or kicked free entirely by radiation in the upper atmosphere and can then be sent shooting off into space much more easily than things like oxygen. 

Oxygen, being heavy, stays around, but actually disappears from atmospheres in the other direction by getting sequestered into rock. 

Most rocks, be it sand or limestone or granite or metal ores tend to be composed in large part of oxygen. 

If there’s not a lot of water or ice already on a planet you can always get more oxygen by taking it out of those rocks. 

That’s quite energy intensive. 

It is so energy intensive that even if you covered every inch of a planet with efficient solar panels that did nothing but cook oxygen out of the rock by melting or electrolysis it would still take anywhere from many centuries to many thousands of years to collect all the oxygen you need for even modest shallow oceans and breathing air. 

Of course you also have to worry about keeping that oxygen, if removed from dirt, from going right back into it. 

Separate iron oxide, rust, into iron and oxygen, and the iron will just rusting again and sucking the oxygen back in. 

Still you can get oxygen out of it to make air and water. 

But you’d still need hydrogen for water and odds are you’ll need to bring it in from elsewhere. 

If the planet had large quantities it would already have oceans. 

Now you could opt just to bring in water directly as it is plentiful in the form of ice in the outer solar system and likely would be in any solar system, but it’s debatable if this is much of cost saving exercise since most of the weight of water is oxygen, nearly 90%, and moving that oxygen millions of miles costs energy in a similar range to cooking oxygen out of rock. 

It also matters where you’re getting that energy from. 

Planets we’re interested in terraforming tend to be good places for solar power, places where ice is plentiful are obviously not. 

If they got a lot of sunlight they wouldn’t have ice. 

The flip side is that there are places in this solar system where hydrogen exists in massive quantities by itself instead of as water or methane or ammonia, but these tend to have massive gravity wells. 

Gravity is never your friend when trying to ship matter in bulk. 

We’ll talk about moving hydrogen when we talk about air, since it’s a similar process for getting nitrogen, another thing not in much supply on Mars for instance. 

Before we move on to that we’ve two other big concerns that often get overlooked in terraforming where water is concerned. 

First, while Mars for instance isn’t a great example because its crust is both similar in composition to Earth’s and has previously had water on it, we need to remember that water dissolves stuff. 

Like continents. 

The rate water evaporates at, and therefore rains at, isn’t too well related to the amount of it now on your planet in your early terraforming days. 

Long before you’ve swathes of ocean miles deep you’ll have rainfall, lots of rainfall, because a thin puddle of water a few inches deep evaporates water just as fast as deep trench with the same surface area. 

So long before the planet has anything like the volume of water Earth has you’ll start getting serious amounts of rain. 

Especially if there’s not much atmosphere, because water evaporates quicker in low pressures. 

Now lots of rain is good. 

Except rain dissolves dirt and there won’t be any plant roots helping prevent erosion since plants need rain. 

And without pre-existing rivers you’ll end up with floods and building destroying waves of mud. 

So terraforming requires you to either get an atmosphere in place before there’s much water or requires you go out cutting spillways and reservoirs all over the place. 

If you know the kind of engineering muscle it take to keep the Mississippi river in check, or to prevent soil erosion of farmland, think of that and multiply it by a thousand. 

That other issue is that you don’t just want to keep toxic heavy metals out of your soil and water, but you also need to make sure some other things are dissolving into it. 

Like salt, if you want seawater. 

Earth’s crust has a lot of sodium in it, 2-3%, similar to the salinity of our oceans. 

Sodium and Chloride though not terribly rare aren’t going to be abundant on every planet’s crust and aren’t particular common in asteroids either. 

So water, which initially seem simple, turns out to be a bit more complex than we first thought. 

How about air? 

We’ve already mentioned one way to get air, baking it from the rocks, or electrolyzing it from water if that’s very abundant. 

But that’s just oxygen. 

We need nitrogen too, for plants to live. 

Now on both Venus and Mars nitrogen is the second most abundant component of air, right after carbon dioxide. 

But for Mars the atmosphere is quite thin so that doesn’t equal much, only a small fraction what is needed, and it doesn’t appear to have it in abundance in the rocks either. 

If we’re wrong on that, and we may well be, then we can cook it out of the local rock. 

In Venus’s cases we have the reverse problem. 

Venus may only have about 3 or 4 % nitrogen compared to Earth’s own nearly 80%, but Venus’s atmosphere is nearly a hundred times more massive than our own and Venus is a bit smaller than us too, so it has few times more nitrogen in its air than we need for an Earth-like atmosphere there. 

Now you need some more for in the dirt and plants themselves but not much. 

So Venus is one place we can get Nitrogen for Mars at, the other is Saturn’s moon Titan which has an atmosphere composed of almost pure nitrogen and the rest mostly methane which is quite handy itself for terraforming cold worlds like Mars because it’s a greenhouse gas and has a lot of hydrogen in it too. 

How do we move air from one place to another? 

How do we move hydrogen from a place like Jupiter to Mars or Venus, which itself has very little hydrogen? 

Just imagining a giant ship moving billions of tons from place to place is probably a bit unrealistic. 

A million tons of air at normal pressure takes up about a cubic kilometer, and even a ship that big would need to make a few billion trips to move a planet’s atmosphere. 

The biggest oil supertankers on Earth can haul a few hundred thousand tons of oil, and if you were thinking of things that big, making the round trip once a year for a thousand years, you’d need ten million of them in service. 

Even when we’re talking about redirecting comets at a planet we’re talking about needing hundreds of millions if not billions of them. 

If you’ve seen any of the Megastructures videos on this channel you might be thinking of a few solutions. 

The first three episodes of that deal with nothing but moving huge amounts of matter off of planets cheaply. 

And it needs to be cheap, for context if it were costing only one dollar per ton you’d still spend over a quadrillion dollars, which is more than our entire planet’s GDP for a decade. 

Don’t have many illusions about terraforming, people often talk about how we can do something, then just sort of handwave how that goes from in the lab to being done at the planetary scale. 

With the exception of para-terraforming, and one of the reasons why it’s so popular, there’s not a single planet we could terraform without having massively improved automation and power sources. 

Sometimes I’ll mention heating planets with orbital mirrors the size of planets themselves, or rather many mirrors with a total size on that scale, and people will object on the grounds that doing something like that would be ludicrously expensive. 

Then they’ll turn right around and suggest moving planet’s worth of air and water. 

Those planet sized orbital mirrors will be thin sheets a few millimeters in thickness tops, so a planet sized one would not even mass a trillion tons. 

Whereas Earth’s atmosphere weighs about 5,000 trillion tons. 

That doesn’t mean it can’t be done. 

The resources needed are in this solar system, Jupiter has many times more hydrogen than Earth has rock, Titan and Venus both have abundant nitrogen, and oxygen is plentiful everywhere in the inner solar system except on Mercury. 

On a place like Titan we’d likely go the mass driver route, filling metal pods about as thick as soda cans and as big as semi-trailers full of high-pressure gas and just firing them off, one after another, from the surface. 

Titan’s gravity is so weak compared to Earth that we can build structures miles long and high peeking out over the top of the atmosphere. 

Coming up with the metal for the structures and pods isn’t too hard, Titan has a rocky metallic core and digging very deep on low-gravity worlds is actually quite easy, especially when you’re mostly just melting your way through ice until you get to the rock, and Saturn has other more rocky moons that could be sources. 

Mass drivers are perfect for a place like Titan, as are space elevators, except that Titan doesn’t get much sunlight for solar power, only about 1% of what Earth gets per unit area, and isn’t likely to be abundant in fissile materials like Uranium. 

So Titan is only a good source if you’ve got Nuclear Fusion. 

Without that you might still be able to run mass drivers, solar can be concentrated with thin mirrors and lenses for instance, but it wouldn’t be easy and we’re talking about shifting trillions of tons of matter to another planet every year just to get enough to finish the job in a timeline of centuries. 

If we’re imagining those pods, say containing ten tons of nitrogen gas, you’d have to launch one every second for thirty million years to get about the right amount of nitrogen to Mars. 

That means needing a lot of mass drivers and a lot of energy to get it done on any timeline worth doing and the entire solar energy budget of Titan if we wrapped the thing in solar panels is only around a billion megawatts, compared to Earth’s own 200 billion megawatts. 

Even with very efficient conversion of that light straight into kinetic energy you need several thousand megawatts per ton of matter flow you’re trying to get into space and off to Mars and that level of efficiency is not too realistic. 

But if you achieved that you could move enough nitrogen to Mars in several centuries to get the job done, lower efficiency, longer timelines, and more panels and mirrors all needing maintenance and needing it for longer. 

Needless to say nuclear fusion makes things much easier if you’ve got it, and it makes terraforming Titan much more plausible too, which you might want to do too if you if you’re planning to hang out there for centuries pumping off gas anyway. 

For Venus and Jupiter the game’s a bit different. 

You could put floating mass drivers in the upper atmosphere, shooting nitrogen and carbon dioxide off Venus, and hydrogen from Jupiter, but for Jupiter you have the advantage that it’s got a very strong magnetic field, and if you’ve seen the video on skyhooks you know that those ideally operate by regenerating their momentum by using electricity to shove off a planet’s own magnetosphere using a process called Electrodynamic Tethering. 

So they can rotate down, drop off empty pods at floating refineries, pick up full ones, fling them off to their destination, and end a little lower in the process from friction and momentum transfer. 

They then shove off the magnetosphere to get back up. 

Hypothetically you can mine Jupiter’s moons for the metal for the pods, fling them to Venus, which catches them, steals momentum in the process, empties their hydrogen into Venus’s atmosphere and fills the pods with nitrogen that then get flung to Mars. 

And rotating skyhooks – often called rotovators in this context – can still work on Venus since it does have some magnetic field and there’s abundant solar power, and other ways to regenerate momentum too. 

But since there is it might be easier to just use floating mass drivers. 

When it comes to floating structures, ones being held up same as a blimp, a thing to remember is they can be very big and that the top can be higher than the bottom so you could build a mass driver where the refineries and launch point are lower down where the air is thicker while the exit point and solar panels running it are up higher where there’s less air to cause drag on the projectile and attenuate sunlight. 

We’ll look at Venus in a bit more detail in a moment but I want to give a quick mention to Wormholes. 

Wormhole are obviously another way to move mass fast, same as artificial gravity is a great way to adjust a planet’s gravity to Earth-normal and nuclear fusion is a great source of cheap and abundant power. 

Of the three of these only the last, Nuclear Fusion, appears has much chance to appear in the near future for us, and personally I don’t hold out much hope we’ll ever have the other two. 

This video is about all the options though so it wouldn’t be right to skip mentioning them. 

Fusion is quite likely to be available for us to help in Terraforming, and will help a lot, but we’ll try in this video to address options without using it. 

Ditto, nanotechnology or genetically engineered organisms able to eat rock and spit out gas on an otherwise airless world would be very helpful too, but none of these things allow super-rapid terraforming because of Thermodynamics. 

As we discussed when talking about nanomachines and grey goo in the Fermi Paradox Apocalypse How video, every mechanical process, or chemical or electrical process, generates heat. 

When you start running the numbers on this stuff you find that planetary transformations like terraforming usually generate way more heat regardless of the method than the planet gets in several years of Earth-like sunlight so you can’t go too fast or you’ll melt everything including your machines in all the excess heat. 

Even with things like wormholes you have to consider how all that mass transfer is going to effect pressure and heat. 

We won’t look at these options much though because not only are they outside the realm of the near future but they also make the subject pretty boring. 

If you can dump a vial of nanomachines on a planet and just come back to it ready made in a couple of decades there’s not much to discuss. 

Similarly if you’ve got functioning wormholes, then you can not only open them to places with abundant water or air, and open them to places with pre-existing industry to make transport of people and infrastructure easy, but you could also open them near or maybe even in your own sun, which is obviously a pretty handy way to get more light on Mars or more hydrogen on Venus and would give you a power source on at least on par with nuclear fusion. 

Also while discussing nuclear fusion I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the one working form of nuclear fusion we currently have, and its application for terraforming. 

Thermonuclear bombs, or fusion bombs, have a long history with terraforming contemplations. 

You can use them to blow off the excess air on a planet or rapidly cook air out of a planet’s soil. 

Needless to say you’ve got fallout issues but the bigger bombs generate almost all their energy from fusion which isn’t a big radioactive fallout generator anyway. 

A lot of people flinch away from terraforming Mars by starting with a nuclear bombardment that would eclipse the worst Cold War scenarios but it is a lot more manageable than you might think in terms of irradiating a planet beyond habitability. 

Truth be told it gets a lot of mention in terraforming conversations exactly because it is such a good approach in spite of the radiation issue. 

And there’s really just no such thing as non-destructive terraforming, that’s why there’s such a bioforming versus terraforming ethics debate. 

Let’s get back to Venus. 

Often overlooked in favor Mars it’s easy to forget that Venus has a lot more going for it in some areas. 

Its gravity is nearly the same as Earth’s, it’s got plenty of nitrogen, and it’s got plenty of light. 

Those last two are actually the big problem. 

Venus is very hot and its atmosphere is nearly a hundred times more massive than Earth’s and it’s mostly carbon dioxide, which is heavier than nitrogen and oxygen air. 

Short term, in the para-terraforming sense, that atmosphere is so thick you can float normal air in it. 

Conveniently in the upper atmosphere of Venus, by the time the pressure drops to earth normal the temperature also drops to something comfortable too. 

At about 200 miles up you can float a balloon made of normal human-breathable air at normal human temperature and pressure and still have lifting power since its less dense then carbon dioxide. 

Now that needs to be in a metal shell and support some weight but if you’re not clear on how lifting power of gases works it’s pretty straight forward. 

You just take a given volume of your local air and figure out its mass for that pressure and temperature, than subtract the mass of an equal volume of your lifting gas at the same pressure and temperature, or at a higher temperature for a hot air balloon for instance. 

Whatever mass is left over is the mass you have to work with for your shell holding the gas inside and for your payload. 

The advantage of using normal air is that you can use the entire volume of your object instead of attaching something separate like you need to do with helium, and you have a reserve of breathable air. 

If you’re curious, for air and carbon dioxide that difference is about 700 grams a cubic meter or about 44 pounds for a 10x10x10 foot cube of a thousand cubic feet. 

So if you made an aluminum balloon, for instance, 200 meters in diameter, that gives you a volume of about 4.2 million cubic meters or about 3 million kilograms or 3000 tons of lifting force. 

It also means your shell is 125,000 square meters and a millimeter thick sheet of aluminum weighs just under 3 kilograms per square meter. 

So if you were willing to devote half you lifting mass to making the shell it would be about 4-5 millimeters or a fifth of an inch thick. 

Now if you double that diameter you get 8 times the volume and lifting force, but only increase the surface area by a factor of four, so you can get double the thickness on your shell or use the same thickness but only needs a quarter of your payload to be the shell, not half. 

And that keeps going, as volume always rises faster than surface area, so you can make some fairly impressive floating structures on Venus, especially if you’re bringing in hydrogen which has even more lifting power. 

You could have whole floating continents, like tied together rafts. 

This doesn’t work as well on gas giants because they are made of hydrogen and helium so your breathing air has to part of your payload, not your lifting gas, which would probably need to be hot pure hydrogen to be even a little feasible. 

But it works on Venus, and worlds like Venus, just fine. 

Problem is, what next? 

Well there doesn’t need to be a next necessarily, same as you could just dome over Mars as a Worldhouse you could swath all Venus in floating cities and even if you took all the nitrogen away, to use on other worlds, you’d actually float a little better since it would be make the air outside your balloons a little denser by removing it. 

But if you want to live on the surface and slowly remove the super-dense atmosphere you’re going to eventually need transition out from those floating habitats and that would probably mean supporting them from underneath with pylons. 

For Venus those would need to be a couple hundred miles high. 

If you saw the video on mass drivers and launch loops you might recall at the end we discussed space fountains, giant thin structures that can be built to heights far beyond what normal building materials allow. 

These would be an example of how you could keep holding those habitats up while you made Venus’s atmosphere thinner and cooler. 

How would we do that? 

Well one option is to just transport it away, bit by bit. 

Another option for cooling the planet is to erect giant solar shades between Venus and the Sun. 

At the kind of pressures Venus’s atmosphere has, by the time it hit about Earth Temperature the Carbon dioxide will reach its supercritical point and start falling down and forming seas of carbon dioxide. 

It’s only at Earth pressures that carbon dioxide has no liquid phase, going straight from dry ice to gas. 

At pressures five times higher than Earth’s it forms a liquid, and Venus’s pressure is ninety times Earth’s, not just 5. 

So you get seas of carbon dioxide. 

You just keep shading the planet then, dropping its temperature below Earth’s by not letting much or any sunlight in. 

Soon it will drop to temperatures too cold for life, and at 217 Kelvin, or -70 Fahrenheit, those oceans will freeze into dry ice. 

And you just pave over them. 

When Paul Birch ran the calculations on this cooling time, it worked out to be only a couple hundred years. 

You could speed even that up by erecting cooling towers rising from the lowest and hottest places to higher places. 

So for instance our floating cities could wait till the atmosphere cooled enough near the ground to build towers, space fountains, to hold them up and use those to pump heat off Venus faster. 

While you’re cooling the planet you steal nitrogen from the air and bring in water or hydrogen to make water. 

In a couple hundred years you pave over the dry ice frozen seas and then remove some but not all of your solar shades to bring the temperature back up to Earth normal. 

The 1991 paper by the late Paul Birch, “Terraforming Venus Quickly” goes into more details on floating cities, atmosphere cooling, solar shades, and the works. 

It’s fairly short and Birch had a knack for putting in all the technical details while still making papers readable without understanding those, so I do recommend it and it is linked below. 

Now giving Venus a day as long as Earth’s is another matter and we’ll come back to that later. 

First I want to talk briefly about the opposite case, places where this isn’t enough air, like Mars or our own moon. 

I mentioned earlier that people tend to mistakenly assume these places are too small to hold an atmosphere. 

There’s some truth to that but not the way they think. 

Air, depending on what it’s made of and how hot it is, has a speed associated to it. 

That speed, essentially the average speed of gas molecules for a given mass and temperature, is called the root mean square speed. 

The equation I’ve got up shows you how to calculate that, and this table shows you what it is for various common gasses at roughly Earth Temperatures. 

Take a moment to note that the temperature is in Kelvin, and speed rises with its square root. 

So if you wanted to double the speed you’d need to quadruple the Temperature. 

We live at around 300 Kelvin, quadruple that is 1200 Kelvin, which is even hotter than Venus or Mercury. 

But even doubled, most of these would still have a speed far, far short of escape velocity from even a place like the Moon where the escape velocity is just over a fifth of Earth’s. 

Now not all particles will be moving at the same speed, some will move faster, following a Boltzmann distribution curve, and this is called the Jeans Escape Mechanism. 

A very small fraction of the gases will be moving much faster, at any given time about a millionth of them will be moving four times faster than normal. 

Meaning for Earth free hydrogen and helium gases will occasionally be moving at sufficient speed to leave. 

Earth loses an estimated hundred thousand tons of gas a year this way, almost all of it hydrogen and helium. 

If a planet is cooler, like Mars, it would lose less, and if it’s got a lower escape velocity, like Mars, it would lose more. 

But as huge as a hundred thousand tons a year sounds like, Earth’s atmosphere masses about 50 billion times that. 

Even places like Mars or our moon would take geological timescales to shed an atmosphere via Jeans Escape. 

But that’s not the only way to lose air. 

We know of two others, planets can leach air into rock and dirt, called sequestration. 

It can also lose it to being blown off by nukes, and of course comet and asteroid impacts can do the same. 

Another way, a bigger way, is for the individual particles to be hit by radiation and slammed clean free of the atmosphere. 

If you picture a helium atom kicking around the thin upper atmosphere of a planet, that then gets hit by a powerful photon like a gamma or X-ray particle, it just soaked up that photon’s entire momentum. 

If we’re looking at a helium atom on the terminator of the planet spinning away from the sun then it’s got some additional momentum already from the planet’s spin. 

Same as we launch rockets west to east to take advantage of Earth’s own spin to get into orbit. 

If that helium atom is already moving in that direction, as many will be, and has the planet’s own spin, and gets hit by photons which are also moving in that direction, the combined energy and momentum can send it zipping off into space. 

This is generally going to throw off far more atmosphere than Jeans Escape. 

This is also why you hear about the importance of Magnetospheres to making planet’s habitable. 

It’s not just that the radiation off the sun, before it’s been filtered by our own air and magnetosphere, is inimical to life. 

It’s that without a magnetosphere to help counter the highest energy particles you’d have more air particles getting launched away, and magnetospheres can also deflect charged particles, like a lone hydrogen, nitrogen, or oxygen atom, back down into the atmosphere. 

There’s more to it than that, for instance Venus has a very dense atmosphere in spite of being way hotter than Earth and having no appreciable magnetosphere, but that’s all the more time we can spend on it today. 

Summary form, any planet or moon massive enough that its escape velocity is a couple thousand meters a second can hold an atmosphere for a very long time by human standards so long as you shield the planet from high energy particles and radiation. 

You do that with a magnetosphere, though there are other ways we’ll also discuss. 

Now you occasionally hear people suggest you could get Mars’ core spinning again to produce a sufficient Magnetosphere, and that is possible, but it is way harder than just dumping a nuke down a very long shaft. 

If you’ve seen the movie the Core, where Earth’s core stops spinning and they travel down to get it started again, then just ignore every single thing in that film mentioned as science. 

Honestly I’ve seen better science in some of the old 50’s scifi serials like Commando Cody where they walk around on the moon without spacesuits or take off in rockets with rolling chairs in them. 

You can, of course, dump millions of nukes off to reheat and re-spin a planet’s core. 

You wouldn’t want to be on that planet while this was happening though since things tend to expand when heated and the kind of Earthquakes that would set off would make a major Earthquake on Earth seem like a light ground tremor and they’d probably go on like that for centuries. 

So you’d probably go the artificial route. 

You can make a magnetosphere by doing rings of solar powered satellites around a planet generating magnetic fields. 

This is a lot more power and energy efficient than melting millions of trillions of tons of iron and nickel in a planet core. 

Similarly, just like with solar shades, you can stick magnetic deflectors out at a planet’s L-1 Lagrange point with its sun and deflect solar wind away. 

The other option is to just use straight matter to stop radiation. 

Same as you can stick thick domes overhead on a planet to cut it down, you could litter the planet’s orbit with many concentric layers of thin material or do the same at the Lagrange Point. 

All of these approaches need maintenance too, parts replaced, but they’d be a tiny fraction of the mass of a planet core and a lot of planets would already have various small moons in orbit that could just be pulverized carefully to generate such a shield. 

Superconducting magnets are a lot easier to keep working in space in many respects, so as these hopefully get better and cheaper with time an artificial magnetosphere becomes a lot saner as an option. 

We’re already looking at this as a protective system, like in the tethered magshield design, for interplanetary spacecraft to get both their radiation protection and some artificial spin gravity. 

If you saw the video on orbital rings then you already know the idea of a giant superconducting ring around a planet is pretty feasible, a lot more feasible then reheating a planet core, and also lets us do it for place like our own Moon that couldn’t realistically produce enough on its own anyway. 

It’s also good for options like Venus where the day is so long that you don’t have much magnetosphere even though the entire planet is molten, not just the core. 

Same issue for Terraforming Mercury. 

Yes it’s really close to the Sun, yes it is even less massive than Mars, yes its day is a couple months long, and yes it could be terraformed too. 

Solar shades, artificial magnetosphere, solar mirrors to bounce light around so night and day doesn’t last months. 

Paraterraforming on a place like Mercury isn’t terribly bad either. 

If you want to build a base on Mercury, where there’s no air to transfer heat, you stick you base up on stilts of sturdy materials that don’t conduct heat well and you stick a shiny thin metal umbrella over it to shade it. 

I sometimes call this a mushroom habitat. 

Mercury’s surface gravity is about the same as Mars has, almost identical, because while Mercury is smaller than Mars it’s also denser. 

It’s denser because almost all the light elements have baked away so you can’t expect to get your water and air locally. 

Now we don’t really know if Mars and Mercury’s surface gravity is really enough for people in the long term, it probably is, but as I’ve mentioned in the past you could build your bases there to spin and combine natural and spin gravity to get something more comfortable. 

If you’re already built up on stilts and under an umbrella spinning a base through a near non-existent atmosphere isn’t that big a deal. 

You could forego that setup by just placing solar shades in orbit or at the Lagrange point too, and give the planet a few decades to chill out. 

Most solar system expansion ideas usually call for Mercury to be mined until there’s nothing left to make artificial habitats out of, so I don’t usually spend much time thinking about terraforming the place, but even then you’d need thousands of years minimum to rip the place apart so bases on stilts under mushrooms makes a lot of sense. 

If you’re using a planet’s own sunlight to extract its minerals for offworld export then even with maximum efficiency you are talking timelines of many thousands of years to do that even for a place like Mercury with far less gravity and mass than Earth and far more sunlight than Earth. 

We’ve mentioned daylight too. 

Most planets don’t have day lengths we’d find comfortable. 

Mars has a day very similar to Earth’s own, but Venus and Mercury definitely don’t, and most large moons like Ganymede or Europa or our own take many days or even weeks to complete one day for themselves. 

We talked about the example of moons with Earth-like days in the third video on in the Habitable Planets series, but most moons don’t have 1 day orbits and don’t have Earth-like mass. 

So what do you do to get a 24-hour day if the planet doesn’t have one? 

We mentioned mirrors, and it is possible to use a combination of orbital mirrors and shades to produce a 24 hour day on a planet, in terms of its night and day length not its actual spin. 

This gets pretty muscular and complicated but it’s nothing like as muscular as changing a planet’s spin. 

Still it can be done. 

You can change a planet’s spin without needing any super-science. 

This isn’t easy but it’s not any harder, and in some ways easier, than trying to screw with the planet’s core to make a magnetosphere. 

If a planet is spinning too fast, as many would be – the Earth’s day used to be 12 hours long after all - you can actually harvest that energy to power your terraforming while slowing the planet. 

Earth’s current rotation energy is about 2x 10^29 Joules of energy. 

Which is a lot of juice, for comparison, it’s equal to all the energy the sun shines on the Earth for a trillion seconds, or about 30 years. 

That also tells you how long you’d need to power something like that strictly off solar power or how long you need to spend to avoid dumping so much energy on a planet you’d melt the place. 

The energy involved doing this is fairly comparable to what you’d to spend to get a planet’s core spinning to generate a decent magnetosphere. 

How would you do that? 

Well you could attach rocket thrusters right to a planet or detonate millions of nukes but a better route would be to build giant towers over the planet’s atmosphere and point orbital mirrors at them, like a big water mill. 

Or aim those same mirrors at one edge of the planet and use the energy to bake air out of the soil while you’re at it. 

This is going to take a long while but that’s okay because increasing the spin rate of a planet should be done slowly to give stuff a chance to settle. 

Slowing it down, same concept, but you could potentially power things with that. 

A planet’s spin isn’t the easiest thing to tap for energy but waste not, want not. 

Same concept for adjusting the year, except if you want to adjust a planet’s year you’re also changing the sunlight it gets. 

Only thing is Earth’s Orbital energy around the sun is about 10,000 times its rotational energy around its own axis. 

Even ignoring the energy issue, or how to get that much energy, it’s hard to do this in a non-destructive way in less than many millions of years. 

You’d normally use a gravitational tractor, which is where you stick something, like our own moon, in orbit around the planet and shove that object away from the planet when it is one the far side of the sun then back toward the planet when it is near the sun. 

That keeps the object in the same relative position to the planet while pushing the planet further away from the sun. 

Do the reverse to bring the planet closer. 

You could do this with a giant solar sail being hit by sunlight, or many of them, but you can’t make them too thin or dump too much energy on them at a time or they’ll fly off. 

This is a lot like the Shkadov Thruster I’ve discussed before in the Megastructures or Dyson Dilemma videos as a way to move entire suns. 

Moving planets, moving stars, moving whole galaxies, isn’t the realm of super-science it’s just the realm of brute force. 

It’s the difference between stacking a few stones across a creek to make a small pool one afternoon and building the Great Wall of China. 

Same process, just way more time and effort. 

The key thing to remember is even if you have an infinite power source you can’t move the planet too fast without heating the planet up. 

Your average planet’s orbital energy tends to be on a similar scale to what you’d need to vaporize a planet so you can’t be applying this all at once. 

The other aspect is that since it is similar to the energy needed to vaporize the planet someone’s going to point out that it makes way more sense to just convert the entire planet into trillions of orbital habitats with a million times the living area. 

Earth’s rotational Energy is comparable to the sunlight it receives over thirty years, its orbital energy is more like half a million years. 

Energy used in such processes is going to see a big chunk dissipate as heat so if you don’t want to roast the planet you need to go very slow even if you have the energy to go faster. 

Needless to say it’s always going to be both faster and easier to use orbital mirrors or shades to replicate the effect so moving planets is probably the sort of thing you’d only ever do with a planet to move it away from its own star as it heats up over its lifetime. 

You can take billions of years to do that and would want to anyway, slowly moving a planet further from its star as the star gets hotter. 

Now axial tilt can be adjusted in a similar fashion but is more like adjusting day length then year length. 

Same sort of concept, you use gravitational tractors or various other means. 

Takes time, it’s very brute force, but it can be done. 

Gravity is harder. 

If you don’t like a planet’s gravity you can only add or remove mass. 

If the gravity is lower than Earth’s than you can make spinning habitats that combine natural and spin gravity. 

If the gravity is higher the only way to do it is to hang some material like ultra dense deuterium or neutronium over your city to locally negate some of the gravity. 

This isn’t necessarily completely undoable, but people might feel a little nervous living under a billions tons of matter hanging over their heads. 

On the other hand if you live in the lower floor of a skyscraper you live with thousands of tons of matter hanging over your head anyway and a thousand, a million, or a trillion, you’re basically just as dead if it falls down. 

Gravity’s also very hard to bioform around, because while low gravity would likely not be a big issue high gravity is. 

Slip and fall in the shower a high-gravity world and you’d shatter every bone in your body. 

We discussed in the launch loops and mass drivers video how the big limitation on mass drivers launching people is that we just can’t handle high acceleration, which is the same as gravity according to Einstein. 

So barring someone inventing the cool artificial gravity most scifi tv shows have… because it’s hard to film in zero gravity… world’s with much higher gravity than Earth aren’t good for terraforming, and even for paraterraforming unless you’re cool with transferring your mind into a cyborg body with titanium bones. 

Which to be fair, a lot of us would be fine with, especially the generally pro-science sorts who probably make up the majority of my audience, but I usually try to focus on the routes that don’t involve cyborging people up or tinkering a lot with their genes even though I’m basically a transhumanist or extropian. 

Key thing, if you get a way of generating or negating gravity, same as if you get wormholes or perpetual motion machines, the entire landscape changes so much I don’t see much point analyzing it. 

Same as in my Dyson Dilemma video, where I mentioned we might find a way to just open portals to uninhabited parallel Earths and if we did you can pretty much write off any space exploration not done specifically for scientific research or ‘because we can’ prestige efforts like climbing Mount Everest. 

We climbed that mountain many a time, nobody has ever built a city up there. 

Now, we’ve looked at a lot of terraforming notions but we haven’t even scratched the surface. 

I may came back and do some more videos on this subject in the future if people seem interested, and I’ll continue to mention planet-specific options in the Habitable Planets series, but for more information take a peek at some of the links below and videos I’ve attached. 

We’ll be looking at alternatives to terraforming, in the form of building worlds and mega structures in the Megastructures series too. 

I can’t give you any good links on bioforming, I’m not qualified to evaluate biology and genetic engineering but if you happen to be, feel free to leave some comments or links below. 

Next in the video series we’ll be taking a look at Rogue Planets in the Interstellar Void, where terraforming can only be done with artificial power sources like fusion, then doing another stand alone video discussing early interstellar colonization concepts like we did with interplanetary colonization here. 

After that we’ll be diving into Rotating Habitats as an alternative to Terraforming.

Megastructures 03 - Launch Loops, Mass Drivers, and Space Fountains
---
  
2015-09-03  
https://youtu.be/zSimYARyL2w  

---

Today we’ll be finishing out our look at Megastructures designed to get people into space by looking at a few more concepts. 

Our main focus will be on the Lofstrom Loop and Star Tram but we will also have some miscellaneous systems near the end of the episode like the Space Fountain. 

After that we will be moving on to talk about rotating habitats. 

Where the first few episodes dealt with megastructures for getting you off a planet, the next few will be looking at where people would live if not on planets. 

We won’t really be looking at technology dealing with planets in this series after today, except in terms of constructing completely artificial planets. 

We will look at more planet based technologies in the upcoming standalone video on terraforming, and we’ll continue to look at such things throughout the series on Habitable Planets. 

These vary so much from planet type to planet type though that it’s easier to look at them there individually. 

Our next video in that series on Rogue Planets in the Interstellar Void, will be coming after that Terraforming video and serve as a lead in to another standalone video on Interstellar Colonization. 

Both of those two videos, Terraforming and Interstellar Colonization, will be summary videos of concepts and technology and so will be on the longer side like the original Megastructures video was or the video on Comprehensive Solutions to the Fermi Paradox. 

If you want a reminder when those videos will be coming out, subscribe to the Channel by clicking on the logo in the bottom right corner, and you may want to turn on the closed captions for the video while you’re down there All right, let’s get started. 

The object that’s been drifting around the background during the introduction is a Lofstrom Loop. 

It is one of the more popular Launch Loop concepts. 

It is essentially a long runway or railroad track hovering 50 miles or 80 kilometers over the ocean, about 1,250 miles or 2000 kilometers long. 

That’s high enough up to get all the air out of the way causing drag on our accelerating ship but still low enough to enjoy Earth’s protection from space debris. 

You would usually situate one of these things on the equator though you don’t have to, and those lines running off at angles are tethers acting as guy wires to help stabilize it. 

What keeps it afloat is essentially the same concept as the orbital ring we discussed in episode 1, though it’s a bit trickier since it isn’t a big circle in actual orbit. 

Down on the ground, connected to some power plants, are loops where matter is accelerated very quickly and hurled up the shaft to the track, running along the track down to the next shaft, which descends into the loop at the other end, which turns it around and throws it back a twin track running in parallel. 

These form the track the ship runs along like a maglev train, but which it can just keep accelerating on the whole way way because there’s not much air in the way to cause drag. 

The matter is running down a rotor, with a stator sheath around it, and that can be superconducting or regular magnets. 

The design predates superconductors. 

The matter running down the rotor can either be one long continuous ribbon of material, like a bike chain or wire, or it can be a stream of ball bearings. 

The rotor itself is an evacuated vacuum tunnel. Normally the sheath would be too. 

Same concept as an orbital ring but shorter and you can build it on the ground and when you power up it slowly floats up. 

. If a chunk breaks the rest of the apparatus falls down, slowed by parachutes. 

These land on the ocean and float there until you have a new section installed and turn it back on. 

Conceptually easy, though it is something of an engineering nightmare to build and keep stable. 

I’ve seen price tags as low as thirty billion dollars for this, but that’s probably being terribly optimistic. 

Like the orbital ring though, or sky hooks, there’s no super-science involved here. 

The science is solid, the engineering is a little less so, but it should be doable. 

There are a lot of valid engineering problems with these, though I’ve heard a lot of silly ones too. 

Like how the loop contains as much energy as a nuclear bomb… which is true… but the nature of such a catastrophic failure would be nothing like a nuclear blast, even ignoring that a nuclear blast spread over a few hundred thousand square miles of empty ocean, minus all the radiation, would not even cause as much damage as a mild thunderstorm. 

There are some other launch loop designs but Lofstrom’s is the best known and they all basically parallel the design in concept. 

One could make a Launch Loop shorter in two ways. 

The first is to have a slower final speed, which could be done if ship flying off was getting hooked by a Skyhook at the end of the track. 

The thing about distance for accelerating objects is that the length of your track, for constant acceleration starting from being stationary, is that it rises with the square of the velocity. 

So if you want to end going twice as fast your loop needs to be four times longer. 

Three times as fast, three squared, nine times longer, ten times as fast, ten squared, a hundred times longer. 

So could use one of these with a skyhook to cut it down to a quarter as long, maybe shorter. 

The other way you can get a shorter track is with a higher rate of acceleration. 

The Lofstrom loop calls for a 3-g acceleration, which is uncomfortable for people to endure but not too bad and they only feel it for a few minutes. 

You could scale that acceleration down to 1-g, normal Earth gravity, but then your track has to be longer. 

A track length for the same final velocity scales inverse to acceleration. 

Double your acceleration, half the distance of track length, triple it, a third the distance, a hundred times the acceleration, a hundredth of the distance… … of course if you did that the people inside would be feeling 300 gees of force which is more than enough to kill you. 

Anything much over 10 gees is a bad idea even for a short time, for people. 

Bullets routinely undergo tens of thousands of gees in the barrel of a gun but bullets have no hearts, lungs, brains, etc. 

Even fairly sophisticated electronics can be built to withstand high-gees, which is why we can get away with putting specially designed electronic fuses on artillery shells. 

So very short, high acceleration tracks are possible but only for dumb matter or specially designed equipment and we tend to refer to these as Mass Drivers, though you will often hear them called a rail gun, coil gun, electromagnetic catapult, space gun, and so on. 

There’s no rigorous definition for these that excludes lower acceleration versions safe for people to be in, but we also don’t call a maglev bullet train a mass driver and it’s the same concept. 

Star Tram, our next space launcher, is often called a mass driver, especially the generation one version which is for cargo-only. 

The Generation One Star Tram design slams a cargo pod down an 80 mile long track at a modest 30 gees. 

It starts off inside the atmosphere and has the ship fly down a tunnel from which the air is evacuated. 

It exits the tunnel which ends on a mountain peak and which air is kept out by a plasma window. 

Plasma Windows, which are basically like a force field on the end of the launch tube to keep the air out, are a pretty neat if new and energy intensive concept. 

You can look them up, but for our purposes they are a problem only in that they need a lot of energy and the energy rises with the diameter. 

Double the diameter, double the power needed. 

One about ten meters or a bit over 30 feet in diameter would need a constant power supply of about 8 megawatts which isn’t horrendous but is nothing to sneeze at either. 

Big difference, and advantage, over the Loftsrom loop, is that it runs at local ground level up the side of a mountain rather than starting off above the atmosphere. 

It is simply an evacuated tube you can run down without air slowing you down. 

This often called a Vacuum Train, or VacTrain, and your acceleration can be made lower by making the track longer. 

VacTrains have long been discussed as a way of doing hypersonic travel at low energy costs, and the HyperLoop design Elon Musk has proposed is a partial VacTrain, though it actually runs on an air cushion like an Air Hockey table instead of via MagLev. 

Star Tram’s Generation 2 Design is basically a tilted Lofstrom Loop, in that’s it very long and  cargo runs at only 2 or 3 gees along it. 

The issue with these sort of launchers is really just about how to keep the top part up where the air is thinner, from falling down. 

Early designs for more modest ones had them held up by hot air balloons for instance. 

The issue is that not only does air slow you down for accelerating but when you exit a vacuum tube into normal air, or even fairly thin air at mountain peaks, it is a bit like slamming into a wall at those kinds of speeds. 

Same as jumping off a diving board into a pool compared with climbing down a ladder into one. 

The paths for these don’t necessarily need to be straight lines either but straight is generally preferable, adding curvature adds in engineer complications that probably aren’t worth it in most cases. 

StarTram is a very attractive system though, especially used in combination with a space plane with its own engines and a skyhook at the end. 

It requires some precision timing, and some propulsion to allow you to maneuver, but if you miss the skyhook you can always fly off to land at a normal airport and try again. 

The StarTram Generation 1.5 system  embraces this idea, calling for a three gee acceleration down a track about 200 miles long ending on a mountain peak where the ship exits and links up to a skyhook. 

Based on current engineering that system would reduce fuel costs for getting into orbit to about 1% of normal and is something we have the technology to build build and could probably do so for a price tag in the upper tens of billions to lower hundreds of billions. 

Hypothetical as little as NASA’s annual budget but more likely you’d be talking about a decade long project that would cost about NASA’s annual budget to maintain each year. 

If I had to guess as to a Space Launch system we’d be likely to employ in the not too distant future, excluding any major breakthroughs that changed the game entirely, then I would bet on something along these lines, probably a shorter and slightly higher acceleration tunnel rising up to a mountain peak then linking up to a skyhook. 

One big thing against it is that this stuff is always best done on or near the equator and west to east, and there aren’t a lot of mountains in the United States on the East Coast and you really do want to exit over ocean or at least uninhabited land if you can. 

Conveniently you do tend to have higher mountains near equators which is not entirely coincidental but I won’t go into now. 

Unfortunately none of countries on Earth with the sorts of industrial and technological muscle to be looking at building such a thing happen to have a convenient east coast mountain near the equator making it a less desirable option. 

Now there’s a number of other ideas that kicked around that are very similar to Launch Loops, Skyhooks, Space Elevators, or Orbital Rings and we’ve already gone long for this video but I want to give a quick honorable mention to the Space Fountain, as it’s probably the only commonly named megastructure that circulates such conversations, and because the concept gets used in a lot other, bigger megastructures Space Fountains are neat ideas, essentially a vertical structure held aloft by firing high speed projectiles straight up which get slowed down along the way, not just from gravity but from magnets at the end or along the path, transferring their momentum into the structure to keep it aloft. 

Energy lost to gravity gets regenerated on the fall back down, though some have suggested that you might not even want to have the matter come back down initially and just use it as construction material to build the tower higher or build other things up there. 

It’s a launch loop in the idea that holds it up, and an orbital ring in that it’s a high structure that remains right over the same place. 

They’re not very good for space launches unless you build them thousands of miles high, in which case they are space elevator that doesn’t rely on tensile strength, but they are ideal for holding up structures that are far taller than you can build from conventional materials. 

That means you can use them to hold structures aloft, like pylons for a bridge, and you can build a lot more redundancy into both them and whatever they are holding up as a result. 

. So space fountains could, for instance, be used to hold up a VacTrain tunnel and be spaced close enough together to give it redundancy if one fails or is attacked and blown up. 

They could be included as part of an orbital ring too as a failsafe, and they have the advantage that you can add segments to increase height as you go, growing them from the ground floor up. 

They also allow you to skip on symmetry so you could use one to build a curved or helical launch loop for instance. 

We will be seeing these a lot further down the road when we talk about certain megastructures like the Matryoshka Shellworld. 

Like the orbital ring, space fountains can be used to do things conventional construction materials could never allow. 

Their obvious disadvantage is that they require a constant power supply to replace lost energy, how much would depend on how efficient the machinery is. 

Theoretically one could be 100% efficient and be a closed system, same as an orbital ring, but in practice nothing is every 100% efficient. 

You can also play this trick with lasers or microwaves by firing them from the ground to bounce off the underside of a station with a reflective bottom. Same concept. 

And if power is cut the thing just falls down slowed by parachutes. 

From here on out we’ll be looking at stuff bigger and further ahead in time, genuine megastructures. 

Don’t forget to subscribe to the channel if you want alerts when those come out and like this video and try some of the other’s on the channel in the meantime. 

As always, thanks for watching, and have a great day!

Habitable Planets, vol III: Large Moons
---
  
2015-08-26  
https://youtu.be/YRzJdg13geU  

---

So far we’ve discussed planets like Pluto that orbit far from their sun, and tidally locked worlds which orbit very close to their sun. 

Today we’ll be looking at worlds that don’t orbit suns at all. 

Moon is a pretty broad concept, as a term it just means any decently sized object in a reasonably stable orbit around a planet. 

They can vary in size from a rock a few miles across to things that are bigger than other planets. 

Our own moon is bigger than Pluto and Jupiter’s moon Ganymede is larger than the planet Mercury. 

The only size limit is that they can’t be bigger than the planet they orbit since if they were the relationship would be backwards, but in practice we would normally deem any moon of fairly similar mass to its planet to be a double planet. 

There’s no rigorous definition of a double planet, but we’d usually say anything less than a tenth the other planet’s mass counts as a moon. 

We’ll look at double planets another time. 

Life on moons like frozen Europa or Saturn’s moon Titan are also interesting possibilities but today we won’t be looking at those either. 

Our subject for today is going to be pretty long just by itself. 

We’ll be focusing on worlds which differ from ideal planets of Earth like mass only in that they are moons, presumably in orbit around gas giants. 

Same mass and composition, same day-night length. 

To avoid confusion we’ll refer to this a Gaian Moon. 

We’ll save the other cases for another day. 

Regarding them briefly though, before moving on to our main subject, the key difference between a moon and an asteroid or dwarf planet in terms of habitability is that they will receive tidal heating. 

As we’ve mentioned previously, the single biggest factor we look at for life arising on a world is if there’s enough energy coming in to as a power supply to biological life and permit temperatures in which the right kind of chemical interactions are commonplace. 

We touched on that more in the video on Pluto and we’ll talk about it more in the future. 

If you have two otherwise identical large asteroids much further away from the sun than Earth is, but one is a captured moon, then that one has all the extra power input of tidal heating to supplement its meager supply of sunlight. 

Which also applies to Earth-like worlds that are moons of gas giants. 

They can get away with being a bit further from the Sun than Earth is and still be warm enough for life. 

Our plants don’t use most of the sunlight that hits them a noon-time, so if there’s another power source keeping the moon warm the moon can be further from the sun than Earth is. 

Indeed they probably can’t exist as close to the sun as we are or they’d be baked by the extra influx of energy from both sources, tidal and solar. 

Now the difference between a moon and a planet, in terms of habitability, doesn’t stop there. 

Two major factors which also apply. 

The first is tidal locking, which we discussed in detail both last time and in the companion video on Tidal Locking. 

Like all the video links I use in these videos, you can click on this one and it will just pause this video and open the other in a new window so if you may want to do so now. 

So let’s talk about Gaian Moons. 

If a planet becomes tidally locked to a star, it has eternal daylight on one side and eternal night on the other. 

Moons locked to a planet are different. 

As we’ve discussed, there’s no dark side of the moon, just a side we can never see from Earth. 

We’ve also discussed why almost every moon is eventually going to end up tidally locked. 

Again click the tidal locking video link if you’re not familiar with that. 

So a moon tidally locked to a planet is going to have a day and night cycle. 

Our moon’s day-night cycle is a month long, which is also a Lunar Day and a Lunar Year. 

Same concept applies to an Earth-sized moon. 

Throughout this video we will use the term day to mean the moon’s day night cycle length, rather than saying year or month, since in this case they are all the same length. 

Now that moon wouldn’t have to have a 24-hour day for life to be possible but the table I’ve got up shows the distance a moon of Earth Mass needs to be from a planet to have a 24-hour orbit. 

Our Gaian Moon case. 

Here’s also a simplified equation you can use if you want to calculate Gaian Moon Distance from planets of different Masses, or if you want to calculate it for an Earth Mass moon with different day-length in hours. 

Pause the video if you want to review these, as I don’t want to turn the video into a math lesson, they’re just Kepler’s law simplified for this specific type of case, an Earth Mass moon. 

The distance up there are only accurate for a roughly circular orbit, for eccentric orbits those would be the semi-major axis. 

Similarly in a moment I’ll bring up the diameters of the planets and that is their equatorial diameter. 

Planets are rarely perfect sphere and gas giants in particular tend to be wider at their equator then poles but we’re working in approximations here so I will just be calling these distance and diameter. 

As you can see in the table I have our four gas giant worlds, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune listed. 

But I’ve also included 6 other examples. 

3 at the beginning which are essentially double planet scenarios, which again we’ll discuss more in the future, and three at the end for a Larger Gas Giant, a thousand times Earth’s mass, then one of about 13 Jupiter Masses, generally considered the point at which gas giants become brown dwarf stars, and finally a minimum mass red dwarf star, one just massive enough to ignite stellar fusion. 

We’ll talk about life around brown dwarf stars another day as well. 

In a moment I’m going to talk about how big these objects are in the night sky of their Gaian Moon, compared to how big the Sun and Moon are in our sky. 

But let me mention the Roche Limit briefly since it occasionally gets mentioned in regard to habitable moons. 

The Roche Limit is the minimum distance a moon can be from a planet, or a planet from a star, before it gets shredded by gravity. 

The more massive the moon, the closer it can be because its own gravity holds it together better, even though its bigger diameter makes the tidal strain on it higher. 

Simply put, the Roche Limit is essentially never relevant to planetary habitability when we’re talking about close Earth parallels like Gaian moons, because the distance they have to be to have an orbital period of a day or so is well beyond the Roche Limit, and the distance a planet needs to be from even the dimmest main sequence star and not be roasted is also well outside the Roche Limit. 

It can be a concern for moons where we aren’t contemplating surface life, but that’s not our concern today. 

So what does the planet look like from the surface of our Gaian Moon? 

First, since it is tidally locked you can only see the planet from one side of the moon, where it will always be visible, and not from the other side, though moons on fairly eccentric orbits will have a wide band around the poles where it will sometimes be visible and sometimes not, due to Libration, as we discussed last time in the Tidally Locked Planets video. 

For those who can see it, the planet will be very large. 

Our table here show how large, in terms of how big our own moon appears to be in our night sky. 

What’s interesting is that while the planet will appear larger and larger as it gets more massive, it will actually peak out when you get to about Saturn’s size. 

Not only is the distance the Gaian Moon is from the planet rising as the planet’s mass rises, so that objects appear smaller, but the density of gas giants starts rising about then too. 

Earth is the densest planet in the solar system, because the bigger planets are mostly made of ice and gas. 

Saturn is less dense then Neptune and Uranus because it is mostly gas whereas Neptune for instance is slightly smaller than Uranus but slightly more massive. 

It is denser because it has a rocky core slightly more massive than Earth then a thick mantle composed of ices of water, methane, and ammonia. 

But Jupiter is much denser than Saturn, yet is still almost all hydrogen. 

Why? 

Well simply put at a certain point gravity kicks in and compresses planets a lot more. 

Brown dwarves, even though they are a dozen to several dozen times more massive than Jupiter, are all about the same size as Jupiter, just much denser. 

So to people living on a Gaian Moon, the visual size of their planet in their sky begins to slowly rise until you get to be about Saturns’ size. 

It then peaks out and begins to drop off slowly as the planet’s stop getting much bigger as their mass increases while the moon’s distance continues to get larger to keep that 24 hour day. 

Then at roughly Jupiter masses the apparent size is going to drop off even more steeply. 

This is very like the effect we noted when discussing red dwarves last time, that the smaller stars look bigger on their habitable worlds because you have to be so much closer to them to stay warm. 

Now this massive planet-moon in the sky has a big effect on night time brightness too. 

While on the back side of the Gaiain Moon they don’t see the planet, though they will likely see the planet’s other moon, on the front side they always see that moon and it is terribly bright. 

Roughly on par with the square of the diameter. 

Our own full moon is nowhere near as bright as our sun, even less than it seems because our eyes are logarithmic to light, but if you made it 20 times wider in the sky it would be 20-squared times brighter, 400 times brighter than now. 

Gas giants also have higher albedos than our moon, about four times higher on average, so they would look even brighter. 

If we plopped Saturn down next to us and stuck Earth in a 24-hour orbit around it, it would appear about 20,000 times brighter than our own moon. 

Now brightness is a very weird concept and hard to compare but simply put, in that case the planet would appear nearly as bright as the sun. 

Especially considering that in order for the Gaian moon to be habitable with all that reflected light and tidal heating from the planet, as well as infrared emissions, the Gaian Moon needs to be further from the sun anyway. 

So the planet in the sky is going to stay more or less stationary in the sky, day or night, wobbling a bit from libration, and go through phases like our own moon does. 

Both sides of the planet are habitable, but the planet side will be warmer than the ‘dark side’, which is again not actually dark, but will be a bit cooler. 

Now if that were all of it, we could stop and say that any moon of similar mass to Earth with a day length reasonably similar to Earth’s would be just as habitable as Earth. 

Unfortunately gas giants are massive sources of radiation, which as a side note would make for some truly massive auroras on Gaian Moons. 

We mentioned last time how planets around red dwarves need strong magnetic fields to avoid having their atmosphere’s stripped off by their sun and the same concept applies to moons of gas giants. 

In the case of a Gaian Moon it would have a strong magnetic field but it will be further shielded from its sun by its planet’s own huge magnetosphere. 

Which is good except that they also get inundated by radiation from that planet’s magnetosphere. 

Our Magnetosphere shields us from the sun’s radiation but a byproduct of that is the Van Allen Radiation Belt, where radiation is actually a lot stronger than it normally is. 

Gas Giants have a similar but stronger setup and many of their moons are right in that radiation belt. 

It’s not really possible for me to give you even a loose rule of thumb for how bad that radiation will be, because there are so many variables involved, even a planets rings can kick in to partially reduce the radiation for instance, but we can say it is a big problem for moons but ironically a smaller one for the two types of possibly habitable moons we’re interested in. 

One like Europa where the life would hypothetically exist deep under the frozen ice in seas protected from radiation and needing no atmosphere, and ones like our hypothetical Gaian Moons where a strong magnetosphere is very likely to exist and shield the atmosphere from being stripped away. 

It’s quite possible that wouldn’t be enough, and as we mentioned with red dwarf planets it may be that none can maintain an atmosphere, but we do have the example of Saturn’s Moon Titan, which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere even though it is far less massive than Earth. 

Though it also six times further than from Saturn than a Gaian Moon would be which reduces the radiation it gets. 

Still the habitability of Gaian Moons around gas and ice giant planets looks fairly promising, not just for simple life but quite possibly for complex life like us. 

So the Star Wars style forest moon of Endor or Yavin IV are definitely in the realm of the plausible to the best of our knowledge. 

In terms of colonization, we obviously don’t have any Gaian Moons in our solar system. 

Ganymede is the largest moon, but it’s still tiny compared to Earth and has a rotation period of a week, Titan’s is about two weeks incidentally. 

Both are far too cold for Earth-like surface life too. 

But if we did find a Gaian Moon around another star, it would be a fairly straightforward colonization. 

Hard to find much better than something with an Earth-like mass, composition, and day-night cycle after all. 

And as I mentioned last time that you can boost a planet’s, or a moon’s, magnetosphere by placing large solar powered magnets in orbit around the thing. 

These would actually work very well in tandem with something like an Orbital Ring if you’ve been following our Megatructures Series. 

Speaking of Megastructures, we’ll be returning to that series next to discuss Lofstrom Loops and other construct for launching objects into orbit before returning to this series.

MegaStructures 02 -  Skyhooks
---
  
2015-08-16  
https://youtu.be/CWLzGGKV0jI  

---

Last time we covered Space Elevators and Orbital Rings, two very nice ways of hauling massive amounts of cargo into space at a fraction of the current cost per pound. 

Now, both of those were essentially introductory pieces so we could move on to even bigger and cooler things. 

We wanted to look at how we’d get up in space in the first place to build all this cool stuff and move people from Earth to them. 

But both had a pair of weaknesses. 

We haven’t got any materials truly strong enough to build a space elevator and an orbital ring is very expensive to build. 

So before we move on we’re going to take a look at a couple other types of megastructures that can help get you into space. 

The first of those is the Skyhook, something you’ve probably never heard of but in truth are very familiar with. 

A classic space elevator is a type of Skyhook, called a Synchronous Skyhook. 

This was before we found ultra-strong materials that made space elevators plausible and it it was just one type of skyhook. 

A skyhook is a pretty simple concept. 

A cable that instead of running from the surface of Earth up past geosynchronous orbit instead hangs from a high orbit down to just over atmosphere. 

Ships then fly up to it, get hooked, and can climb up higher. 

What’s more, while the bottom of the hook moves relative to the ground, it moves slower than objects in orbit at that altitude normally do, so the ship doesn’t need to fly as fast to hook up. 

But how does this work? 

In a nutshell it works off how rates of orbit vary with altitude. 

The further you are from Earth, the slower you orbit, both in real speed and in how long your orbits take. 

To illustrate this let’s take three glowing satellites at different altitudes. 

One, the purple one, is just over the atmosphere. 

One, red, many hundreds of miles higher up, and the third, blue, about twice as far up as that. 

As you can see the purple light orbits faster than the red one which orbits faster than the blue one. 

For a skyhook its top and bottom cover a very long distance, hundreds or even thousands of miles. 

As long as your material can support. 

Since it is occupying all those orbits but is rigid, it will not orbit as quickly as objects at the lower altitude or as slowly as objects in the upper altitude but somewhere in between instead. 

As a result of this the bottom of the skyhook is moving much slower than normal for that altitude, and the top is moving much faster than normal. 

Since kinetic energy rises with the square of velocity, and drag forces also grow as you get faster, you save a lot of fuel by hooking up with the bottom of a skyhook. 

Now the one I’ve been showing you is called a non-rotating skyhook, and is the visually simplest form but not generally considered the best one. 

Most skyhooks designs call for skyhook to rotate. 

Rotating skyhooks spin around their center of mass even as they orbit the Earth, and do so backwards. 

Normally spaceships launch west to east to gain a little extra speed from the earth’s own rotation. 

It’s not a lot, but it’s not tiny either, especially when you don’t need to go as fast because you’re linking up to a skyhook. 

By spinning the skyhook backwards we can play on that trick even more. 

The tip is moving very fast, a few thousand miles an hour in the opposite direction the thing is orbiting, so it is still zipping around the Earth but much slower compared to even a non-rotating hook, making the speed our launch vehicle needs to hook up even slower. 

And that’s the skyhook. 

Not nearly as cheap as a space elevator or orbital ring in energy cost per pound put in orbit but much cheaper than normal space launch. 

If you remember the last video when I mentioned the main cost of an orbital ring was getting it up there in the first place, something like a skyhook could cut those cost down to a fraction. 

But you still need a hypersonic launch vehicle to get to the hook, and while we can build those it’s possible one might want to a skyhook in tandem with a maglev launch system like a Lofstrom Loop or StarTram. 

Types of ground-based megastructures we’ll be looking at in our next video in the series. 

Before we look at those however we’ll be jumping back to our other series on Habitable Planets and looking at Earth-like worlds orbiting as the moons of gas giants.

MegaStructures 01: Orbital Rings & Space Elevators
---
  
2015-08-06  
https://youtu.be/MQLDwY-LT_o  

---

If you’ve been a subscriber to this channel for a while you probably remember my original video on megastructures, which covered everything from space stations a few hundred feet across to ones encompassing entire stars. 

We’ve come a fairly long way since then and like most initial products the quality on it is a lot lower than subsequent works and for me feels like it needs upgraded. 

Rather than just redoing the entire video from scratch though I thought we’d go into each piece in more detail instead. 

Since these are all about huge things you can build in space or on other worlds it seemed like the best place to start would be on those Megastructures designed for getting us off this world to build them in the first place. 

One of those, the Space Elevator, is already pretty heavily discussed elsewhere so we’ll touch on it only lightly. 

Incidentally you might want to flick on the closed captions if you’re having problems understanding me. 

Ironically the original megastructures video is the only one without closed captions since I didn’t use a script for it. 

So, when it comes to getting off Earth and up into space you’ve really got two approaches. 

A self-contained ship or a structure to tow you up there like a space elevator. 

One of our big problems about going up to space is just how expensive it is to haul up every single pound of material using chemical rockets. 

It’s the bottleneck and means that even if we get stuff like smart robots and 3D printing that can build everything up there from materials lying around, or in situ as it’s called, we can never transport people in bulk. 

And that’s our real goal, making space as accessible as other continents. 

Being able to vacation on the Moon as easily as Venice. 

And conventional chemical fuels just aren’t energy-dense enough for that, nor is there any guarantee we’d ever get a working compact nuclear rocket, fission or fusion-powered. 

So what are your alternatives? 

The Space Elevator is obviously one. 

You’re probably know at least the basics about space elevators already, one long super-strong tether running from the equator up to geosynchronous orbit, where it hovers stationary relative to the planet below. 

Or if your material can handle it, several tethers running from places other than the equator up to a shared orbital station, same as guy wires on radio masts. 

Your material needs to be a bit tougher, but you could then place one in New York, Paris, and Buenos Aires for instance all meeting at a central terminal at geosynch. 

Incidentally in our animation here the torus, the donut, would represent a rotating habitat providing artificial gravity, we’ll be talking about those a lot in future videos, and the sphere is simply a counterweight or anchor. 

Now finding a material strong enough to hold its own weight of tens of thousands of miles of length is easier said than done, every material has what’s called a ‘breaking length’, or how long something can be in Earth’s gravity before it breaks under its own weight. 

And for most materials like rope or steel this is on an order of a mile, or ten or twenty miles, and even stuff like Kevlar is only a little over a hundred miles. 

We need ten or twenty thousand miles for a space elevator. 

And while you can extend that a bit by tapering your cable to be wider at the top then the bottom, and gravity does get weaker as you get further away from Earth, the simple reality is we don’t really have anything strong enough to build an Earth Space Elevator yet. 

It should be noted that even if we can’t do one on Earth that doesn’t rule them out for other places. 

Your tether length depends on the world’s day length and gravity, and how long they can be without breaking depends on the local gravity. 

You can do one on Mars that’s shorter and made of weaker material, or on the moon that’s actually longer but could be made of regular old steel or aluminum because gravity is so weak there. 

Now, Space Elevators would definitely be handy but there’s no guarantee we’ll ever find a material strong enough and cheap enough to build them with. 

So are we screwed then if we never find a better basic rocket or stronger material? 

Well, no, we still have a few other options and ones of those is called an Orbital Ring. 

In some ways this is actually a better option than a space elevator too. 

They don’t get as much press or coverage in science fiction so we’ll talk about them in more detail. 

An orbital ring is a giant ring around the planet, which might be only a few feet wide or dozen of miles wide, but around the entire planet. 

Unlike a space elevator whose tether is tens of thousands of miles long and straight up, these are tens of thousands of miles long and wrapped around the planet instead. 

They hover a few hundred miles off the ground and do not move relative to the ground below. 

In our animation they’re not really to scale, one can build one of these things, in theory, of any size but the first one up would probably be so thin you’d need a telescope to see it. 

Once in place you’d be able to lift matter up into space at energy costs far beneath what we spend moving objects by normal air freight, let alone the costs for getting things into orbit. 

Now how does such a thing work? 

There’s a couple ways to do one. 

The simplest and original design is to take a long circular wire up into orbit giving off a magnetic field, spin it at orbital speeds, and magnetically levitate objects over the wire that don’t move relative to the ground below. 

The wire spins under them and they float in place. 

You can stick a second one up in parallel, add floating structure called a ring station, slap on solar panels to keep the power running, and drop a tether down to be used as an elevator that doesn’t require anything like the strength of a normal space elevator. 

You could also do this by building it as a big pipe surrounded with superconducting magnets, like a giant particle accelerator, and just run mass through it, similar to a magnetic rail gun or again a particle accelerator. 

We often call this active or dynamic support and we’ll see the idea a lot. 

But its fundamentally a lot like hooking up both ends of a garden hose to a pump, it will spring into a circle and resist pushing or pulling on it. 

Once you have a small one in place you drop some tethers and haul up more construction material, and you could do another one higher too since it can be at any altitude. 

You can then build a sheath around the whole thing, an orbital ribbon if you prefer. 

You can keep adding more parallel rings or other rings at different angles. 

Orbital rings don’t have to be around the equator. 

Once one is up you can just keep adding more and more very cheaply. 

You supply power to the magnets by solar panels. 

Can we build one of these? 

Yes. 

They are entirely inside known scientific laws. 

So why haven’t we? 

Same reason we don’t have a Moon Base. 

We can do it but it would be very expensive. 

When Nikolai Tesla first suggested this idea not long after the American Civil War we obviously were in no position to even seriously contemplate building one and it got shelved for nearly entire century. 

Arthur C Clarke of 2001: A Space Odyssey fame, and Baul Birch, a scientist who will get mentioned in these videos a lot, both played again with the notion in the late 1970s and 80s but Birch calculated getting one up in space would cost several trillion dollars. 

This could be done for a lot less if the material could be sourced from off world, like the moon, but since the whole point is to make it cheaper to get stuff into space it has a flavor of being a Catch-22. 

It isn’t quite though, because being able to ship people into space by the million isn’t the same as sending up giant robotic factories that built themselves, so one might be able to build those factories with robots then build the ring so you can ship people. 

We want to be able to put large quantities of people up in space who started on Earth, not just run robots or send a few people up who breed more people up there. 

That doesn’t mean we can’t go the robot route first to set the stage. 

The cost estimate was also circa 1980. 

I haven’t seen a more recent one and since then we’ve made some major improvements in material, magnetic, and rocketry which would likely make it a lot cheaper, and since you can use these for hypersonic travel around the planet, not just off a planet, it comes with a more direct and near-term economic advantage. 

Plus, as huge as several trillion dollars to build one sounds, that is almost all launch costs for initial construction, expanding a ring and building a second one would be massively cheaper. 

It’s a one-time buy sort of item and isn’t off the radar, but understandably nobody wants to be looking at making something like that until we’ve spent many decades checking if other avenues might be available. 

It’s the sort of thing you build when you’re fully committed to doing off world industry and colonization, not just some scientific research. 

With one in place you can move freight into space for energy costs comparable to interstate shipping. 

They are very like Space Elevators in that respect but don’t require any super-strong materials we may not ever be able to mass produce. 

So that’s Orbital Rings, our first look into megastructures in space.

Habitable Planets, Vol II: Tidally Locked Worlds
---
  
2015-07-30  
https://youtu.be/K7OloPuLMpA  

---

Last time we talked about life on planets very far from their stars, like Pluto. This time we’ll be looking at life very close to stars instead. Now that can mean two different types of planets, ones which are very hot because they’re very near a star, like Mercury, or ones that aren’t hot because their sun is very dim. We’ll look at the first case, hot or Cthonian planets, another time. In that latter case the worlds have to be so close to their sun that they could become tidally locked to it, so one side always got sunlight and the other never did. The biggest factor in Tidal Locking is how close the object is to the thing it is orbiting and planets around red dwarves have to be very close to be warm enough to be classically habitable. These worlds, sometimes called Twilight Worlds or Eyeball Earths, will be our focus for today. Incidentally if you’re not too familiar with tidal locking you may wish to pause this video and click the link to short Tidal Locking companion video I did for this. It explains what Tidal Locking is, how and why it happens, and why we think planets near red dwarf stars would tend to be tidally locked. 

Also incidentally, if you’re newer to my videos and have a hard time understanding me, you should turn on the closed captions for the video which ought to help. I’ve got a bit of a speech impediment. As I’m sure you’ve noticed. 

So you have a tidally locked planet. This tends to get envisioned as desert on the sun side, dark ice on the night side, and a thin habitable area around the rim lit by twilight. 

Hence the name, twilight worlds. The whole light side lit by a tiny glowing red star. 

But how accurate is that notion? Like a lot of things seen in science fiction, accuracy is a bit hit and miss. First we don’t know that all, or even most, worlds near red dwarves would be tidally locked. Red Dwarves are the supermajority of stars in the Universe and cover a pretty broad range, from ones more than half as massive as our sun to ones less than a tenth of its mass. That’s a far wider proportional variation in mass than most of the stellar types and on the more massive end we wouldn’t expect habitable worlds to be tidally locked. More over, atmospheres and oceans, as well as moons, can impede the tidal locking process. Again we discuss that in the companion video. 

So the bigger red dwarves can have habitable worlds with orbits that take 2 or 3 months, while the smallest it can be two or three days. For these smaller ones tidal locking is a lot more plausible since not only is distance the biggest factor in tidal locking but also because it’s hard to have a big moon on a planet so close to a star that might destabilize its orbit. The other big misconception, or partial misconception, is the appearance of that star to those living on the planet. First, while these stars are smaller, they are way, way closer so they look much bigger in the sky than our own sun does. They would seem to be giant blobs in the sky. Second, while they would look red from twilight band for the same reason our sun looks red at twilight, red dwarves aren’t really red. Our color classification system for stars was a very early and loose system that’s just stuck around. All stars look white. Our own ‘yellow’ sun, which is actually green, or emits its peak wavelength in green light, is fundamentally white. It is too bright in too many frequencies to have a color. Red dwarves have their own peak frequency in the red range of the spectrum, but so do incandescent light bulbs. On any tidal locked world, red dwarf or white supergiant, the sun will look red from the twilight band because of all the air it passes through acting like a prism in what’s called Rayleigh Scattering. 

Everywhere else you see it on a world with an Earth-like atmosphere – and most other types you might expect – the sky will look blue and the sun will be big white glowing orb. The exception would be a habitable world around a red giant because those are simply so big and dim the sun would just blanket the sky in red light rather than being a dense bright object. For most stars though the sun and sky on most of the planet will look more or less like our own does and it’s the atmosphere’s makeup that would have the big effect on color, and will vary a lot just as our own does with time of day and weather. Mars’ has at times a bluish-grey sky, a red one, and a butterscotch one. [show curiosity pics] Now what do we mean by this twilight band? 

How wide is it? Is it the only place life can be? Is one side really desert and the other massive sheet of ice miles deep? And the answer in all those cases is a mix of maybe and depends. We imagine them as deserts on the sun side because if the light is always shining down on one spot, growing a bit weaker as you get away from latitude and longitude zero, you ought to have a constant wind emanating out pushing moisture away and never carrying it back, until it deposits on the dark side in an ever thickening sheet till at last there’s no water anywhere except on a very thin band around the rim. 

However, tidally locked objects do sort of squirm around. We say our own moon only shows us one face all the time, so we see half of it, but that’s not quite true. Libration, an effect of the eccentricity of orbits and of things not being point-like objects, makes slightly more than half of a tidally locked object visible to the object it’s locked to. We can see about 59% of the moon’s surface over the course of a month, not 50%. For a tidally locked planet with similar libration, this would mean the sun will actually dip over and under the horizon in some places of the twilight band. 

And again most habitable zone planets around red dwarves have planetary years lasting a few days to a few months, with the ones most likely to be tidally locked on the shorter end of that. So you’d have spots, for the smaller dwarves, where the sun dipped over and under the horizon every few days, or on a weekly cycle. For them it’s a yearly cycle since they have a very short year and their day is exactly as long as their year, but we’ll try to keep this in comfortable Earth units when we can hopefully without causing confusion. And that short year has another effect, because while our own seasons have to do with our axial tilt, the Earth does get more or less light when it is closer or father from the sun. Amusingly, at least for those of us in the northern hemisphere, the Earth is closest to the sun not long after winter solstice in January and furthest in July. That’s pure coincidence, but it does mean Earth gets about 7% more light in January than in July, and Earth has a very low orbital eccentricity. 

Mercury, the one closest to the sun, has the most eccentricity of any planet, and it get more than twice as much sunlight when closest to the sun than it does when furthest away. 

So a tidally locked world with a decent eccentricity might experience seasons, on say a two week orbit, where the eternal days cooled or warmed rather noticeably. That effect could easily result in weather moving moisture around in peculiar ways. 

Next there’s the dark side. It’s worth remembering that Antarctica is hardly lifeless even in the places where its dark six months out of the year and we’ve found life buried under the ice down there. Tidally locked planets don’t start tidally locked and as we discussed with Pluto, where we do suspect there are oceans under the ice there, or Jupiter’s moon Europa, you can have liquid water where you wouldn’t expect it to be. There’s hundreds of lakes buried under the ice in Antarctica. So we don’t want to write off even the dark sides of these worlds as utterly barren and sterile. 

You’ve got this massive miles deep block of ice there, constantly melting on the sides and having snow come from the sun side adding back to it. But that’s not the only cause of melting. Ice has weight, and that means pressure, and that also means sideways motion. 

If you’re familiar with Game of Thrones, where they have this giant wall made of ice and gravel, you might have heard people mention that it ought to be way wider at the bottom and that the bottom should expand as it gets taller and melt more near the bottom. Obviously that is supposed to be a somewhat magic wall and it’s a fantasy novel but when the laws of physics apply a giant ice cube is going to squish down, get wider at the bottom, and melt in the lower layers so the water isn’t going to stay totally trapped there and depending on how much water the world has you get a thin world-spanning ocean at the rim with icebergs constantly snapping off into it. Also, oceans transport heat around too, so they could expand this habitable band quite a bit. 

Taken as a whole, these twilight worlds with their thin habitable bands might be a lot wider than we used to think. So wide that twilight band might not be properly descriptive for some and the term ‘Eyeball Earth’ might be more apt. 

So could we colonize such a world? Yeah, sure, on the grand list of screwed up planets with weird conditions these sorts are a heck of a lot easier to terraform than most we’ll discuss, for a given value of the world terraform, and probably easier than some place like Mars or Venus. Adapting plants to perpetual daylight is probably feasible, and most plants only use a smaller fraction of the light that hits them at noon anyway so eternal twilight isn’t a big deal. It wouldn’t seem very dark to us either, your eyes are logarithmic in their sensitivity which is why your light bulbs in your home seem perfectly bright at night time but during the day with the windows open, even though only a small fraction of sunlight gets in those windows, you’d barely notice the lights were on. Most house lights illuminate a room at about one thousandth the brightness of the noon time sun, around as bright as the sun on Pluto, so a twilight area of tidally locked world isn’t going to seem dim to you anyway. It will be red from all the air, and the water will be a lot darker, but by and large it will be fairly unexceptional from our point of view. 

Plus, as we mentioned in the video on Pluto, you can always use orbital mirrors, thin light-weight ones, to light the darkside up and shades the sunny side. You could even institute a normal Earth 24 hour day night cycle if you were ambitious. After all a thin mirror can be shiny on one side and opaque on the other and you can make the thing tilt parallel or perpendicular to a star and twist their direction as needed. All things being equal, a tidally locked world is probably the easiest kind to terraform closest to Earth’s own conditions. 

Now how about life evolving there in the first place? Well there’s some challenges there. 

First off, life, at least any life based off normal chemistry even if it isn’t our style, doesn’t handle UV and X-ray radiation well and red dwarves do give that off, especially when they’re younger. You need a magnetosphere to protect that life. Very thick atmospheres or life living under water helps but for classic land life you really do need that magnetic solar shield. We get ours on Earth from a giant molten metal core spinning around. Tidally locked worlds do rotate, their day and their year are the same but they do spin. Ganymede, Jupiter’s largest moon and the largest moon in the solar system, actually bigger than the planet Mercury, is tidally locked to Jupiter and does have a powerful magnetosphere. As I recall it’s the only moon with a strong one and it’s still so weak that Jupiter’s own field dominates it at that distance. Without that magnetosphere, a planet is not just going to have life on it irradiated, but could get its whole atmosphere stripped off by the charged particles its sun deluges it with. Realistically they don’t just need a magnetic field nearly as strong as Earths, they need one decently stronger because red dwarves are fairly unstable as stars go and can really oscillate their radiation a lot. 

On the terraforming end, that’s not a barrier that can’t be overcome. You can simulate a magnetosphere by having big solar powered magnets orbiting the planet just like you can do orbital mirrors. On the natural life end though, that is a worry, air protects from ionizing radiation and our twilight bands will have a lot of air protecting them, that’s why the twilights here on Earth are red, light has to pass through far more air at twilight than at noon. And again the world could have a natural magnetosphere of great strength but while that’s not entirely dependent on rotational speed of a planet, and tidally lock worlds still rotate, once a year which for them might be only a few days or weeks, it doesn’t help matters having less rotation. 

Another consideration is collision. Red Dwarves aren’t all that much less massive than our own sun, even if they are way dimmer, so they could have fairly massive collections of planets like we do. Those planets might be more densely packed, but they also ought to have a lot of comets, and since they are dimmer these won’t evaporate nearly as quickly. There's good odds we owe our own oceans and atmosphere in large part to getting whacked with tons of comets. This is probably a bigger threat to life-bearing worlds around a red dwarf since there could be a lot more comets hitting the thing and more gravitational perturbations by the other planets knocking things into collision orbits and collisions are going to be more common anyway since things are packed in a bit tighter. Circumstances depending, that could be a benefit or hindrance to life evolving there. 

We don’t know for sure how most of these factors add up as pros or cons since we don’t exactly have a plethora of life-bearing worlds to examine or accurate models of how durable life is, but that aspect alone might make red dwarf worlds barren and sterile. Or it might not, in this videos, unlike the Fermi Paradox videos, we take a more optimistic approach to where life might show up. The other good news is we probably won’t have to wait terribly long to learn more about such planets, in our hunt for exoplanets worlds close enough to be tidally locked are among the easier kind to detect. 

In that optimistic regard, tidally locked worlds around red dwarf stars look like pretty good candidates not just for simple life, as we discussed with Pluto, but complex life too. And as science has rolled on we’ve found a lot more positives, and negatives, for these kind of worlds hosting life, more than we can cover here today and we just do know yet. But fundamentally, while most of the planet isn’t very habitable for large land animals like us, probably about 5-20% would be, and even if that area was mostly ocean like Earth is that’s still a large continent worth of land. Probably enough to support a lot of biodiversity and the numbers needed to be putting together a technological civilization from hunter-gatherer levels. So Twilight worlds get the stamp of ‘plausible’ for possible home worlds of intelligent life. 

That’s it for today. If you’ve enjoyed the video hit the like button and try some of the other videos, and don’t forget to hit the subscribe button to be alerted when new videos some out. Thanks for watching, and have a great day!

How does Tidal Locking work?
---
  
2015-07-28  
https://youtu.be/lmc5XqChJpY  

---

In a lot of the planned videos for this channel on all the atypical planets or other objects which might host life, or might be terraformed to host life, we’re going to be talking about tidal locking a lot. I didn’t see any videos around that gave a good, quick, and graphic explanation of how tidal locking actually happens in the first place so we’ll delve into it real quick. Incidentally if you’re new to my videos and have some problems understanding me you might want to turn on the closed captions for the video. 

You’ve probably heard a lot of references to tidal locking of planets or moons over the years but not gotten an explanation for how it happens, just what the final effect is. Moons or planets just do it and it has something to do with tides. 

But what makes a moon slow down so it always has the same side pointing at the planet below? 

If you’re not familiar with tidal locking, it is when a body orbiting another body, like a moon around a planet or a planet around a star, orbits in a fashion that its own day and year are equal in length. It spins around its own axis just once for every time it orbits around the primary body. So it always shows the same face to those looking at it from that primary body. How does this happen though? 

To begin with, any two bodies orbiting together exert tidal forces on each other. That is to say, since gravity gets weaker with distance, there’s always a slightly stronger tug on the sides of these objects facing each other. This distorts the bodies, stretching them toward each other, and gives us tides. This is often called Tidal Flexing. 

But that’s not the end of the story because these objects are spinning. Let’s picture our moon before it was tidally locked and had a fairly regular day length. And let’s pin the earth and moon in place to keep things simple. 

As the moon stretches it is still spinning, and materials take time to stretch and sag, so our bump isn’t going to be pointing straight at the planet. It will have spun a bit off center. Now that the bulge is off center the force of gravity being exerted on it isn’t symmetric anymore. That bump gets pulled on and in the opposite direction the moon is trying to spin. This is called tidal friction, and is no different than putting a brake on a wheel. In time the moon slows down… but it never stops completely spinning because once it’s year and day are the same, once it orbits once for every time its spin on its axis, that stretched bump does point straight down at the planet all the time and isn’t off center anymore. So our frictional force goes away. That’s tidal locking, it is just that simple. 

And the larger body gets the same effect just much weaker and slower. Earth has an off-center bump too it’s just a weaker effect. This is why Earth’s day was originally about 12 hours long when the moon first formed and is now double that, and the moon has become tidally locked. Eventually, given many billions of years, Earth would slow until not only did the moon always show us the same side but we showed it the same side as well. The moon would always be visible to one hemisphere of the planet but not the other though it would still wax and wane in that first hemisphere since moon phases have to do with which side the moon is pointing at the sun. There is no dark side of the moon, just a side we cant’s see. And you can have this happen to a planet with the star it orbits too. But not for the star because they aren’t rigid objects, they experience some tidal friction from their planets but they have no faces, so to speak. 

They do slow down though, just not as much. Same for a gas giant or a world made entirely or primarily of water. Incidentally that rotational energy that’s getting removed to slow the spin of the objects dissipates as heat, frequently a lot of heat, and that’s what is meant by tidal heating. You can also get this from forces exerted by other moons since many planets have several, and from the eccentricity of a moon’s orbit, since things don’t usually orbit in perfect circles. Now let’s look at the math real quick. 

Yugh right? Well there’s a simplified form that works decently, but this isn’t a math lesson. What we’re interested in here are the factors that control the time tidal locking takes. The composition of the planet, in terms of its rigidity, matters because water or ice stretch differently than rock or metal. The mass of the bodies is important. But what really matters is the mass of the primary body and even more the distance between the objects. Bigger planets, or bigger stars, lock there satellites faster, but the single biggest variable is the distance. Double the primaries mass and locking happens 4 times faster, triple it and nine times faster. But doubling the distance makes it take 64 times longer and tripling it makes it take nearly a thousand times longer. Mercury is in a partial tidal lock to the sun, a 3:2 resonance instead of a 1:1, after 4 billion years. Pluto, which is of a similar mass to Mercury, is a hundred times further away. A hundred to the sixth power is a trillion. So 4 billion years for Mercury to get part way there and 4 billion trillion for Pluto, a time so long off that not only would our own sun be long dead, but every star in the universe would be ancient corpses by then. On the other hand Pluto and its own largest moon, Charon, are already tidally locked to each other, so that you could run a space elevator right from the surface of the one to the other. Gas giants with many moons typically have a lot of them tidally locked especially the nearby ones. This is why we so often refer to planets around red dwarf stars as being tidally locked. They are much less massive than our own sun, anywhere from 7% to 60% of the mass, so they lock planets much slower, taking as little as three to as much as 200 times as long as our sun would for a planet of equal distance. 

Key difference is that they aren’t equally distant. For a planet to interest us in this context though it needs to be warm enough for life, and smaller stars put out way, way less power than bigger ones. So planets need to be way, way closer for it to be warm. The smallest of these would need their worlds fifty times closer than Earth is to be warm enough. Their less massive star might take 200 times longer to lock a planet as far off as Earth, but one fifty times closer would lock in 50 to the sixth power shorter, meaning the world would lock many millions of times faster than Earth would around our sun. Same concept applies for habitable moons around gas giants. 

So we often assume worlds in the habitable zones of red dwarf stars will be tidally locked. 

Though newer calculations indicate that the atmospheres of worlds interferes with this more than previously thought. Planetary atmospheres, and oceans, aren’t rigid and move more freely and circle around so they slow down the locking process. Sort of like in the wheel with a break analogy as if we dumped motor oil on the wheel. We don’t have a great model yet for figuring out how much but it will be significant and thicker atmospheres and oceans would slow that even more, so the notion of all red dwarf planets being tidally locked may be in error, especially for bigger red dwarves where the planets would be further away. 

But that in a nutshell is how tidal locking takes place and why it is so important to discussion of exoplanets and moons. If you enjoyed this video, don’t forget to hit the like button, and subscribe to the channel to get alerts of future videos.

Habitable Planets Vol 1
---
  
2015-07-18  
https://youtu.be/cSIPqFgPaZY  

---

In previous videos on the Fermi Paradox we discussed a number of solutions to the question of why life seems so rare in the Universe. One of the more popular scenarios is called the “Rare Earth” option. But rather than just doing a video discussing that in more detail than we already have we’ll use it to segue into a separate series. 

We’re going to look at all the weird planets and even non-planets where life might just conceivably get a foothold, and while we will still be raising all the problems and hurdles life would have existing in these places we will be looking at it from a more optimistic viewpoint. 

To commemorate the fly-by of Pluto taking place at the time I’m recording this, we are going to start off by looking at how life might be able to live on a place like Pluto. A relatively small planet far from a star’s warming light. So we’ll be looking at Pluto and worlds like Pluto in this first installment. We’ll look at how they might conceivably host life and also how such worlds might be colonized to be homes to humans or other technological species. In future installments we’ll look at everything from worlds around red dwarf stars or on moons around Gas Giants. Or even in Gas Giants, both those near stars or rogue worlds out in the interstellar void. We’ll look at how life might live in a comet or asteroid. We’ll try to cover all the reasonable options and even some of the crazier ones. Hit the subscribe button if you want to be alerted when those new episodes come out. So if you’ve seen previous videos you’ll probably notice I’ve started adding in some animations. We’ve got two other new features as well. First, we’ll be trying to keep the videos shorter. [Hurray] And Second, I’ll be experimenting with adding in subtitles [Hurray] I know I’m a bit hard to follow sometimes and remind people of some fictional characters. 

If you’re curious it is a speech impediment, not an accent. 

Hopefully with subtitles I’ll be easier for some of you to follow. Assuming it works of course. 

So let’s get started. I want to emphasize that this is a very hypothetical video, personally I doubt we’d find life on Pluto, even simple organisms, but we can’t rule it out. It isn’t just that such life might run on weird chemistry compared to our own, there could be habitable pockets where Earth-like life could live. 

What about really alien life though? Pluto and worlds like it are basically over-sized comets. Most of their material is stuff that would melt or evaporate if it were on Earth. 

Ice, ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide and even oxygen and nitrogen are frozen solid there. But hydrogen and helium aren’t. Hydrogen doesn’t freeze till it gets even colder than Pluto gets so worlds like it, even ones in the interstellar void, could easily have liquid hydrogen in abundance. When we’re talking about life they key thing is a power source. Hydrogen burns, so you could conceivably have an organism on the super-cold worlds that drank liquid hydrogen and frozen oxygen and used that as it fuel or food. Pretty out there but probably not impossible. 

But what about Earth-like life? Is that at all possible? 

Throughout this series we’ll mention over and over that they key thing life needs is a fuel. It needs a power source. But to be at all Earth-like it needs pressure and temperature too. If you’re far from a sun your options are limited, but we’ve got two. First, a lot of worlds have pockets of radioactive materials. 

Those decay with time but are also a lot more plentiful for that reason when a world is young. Uranium, potassium, and other substances will give off some warmth just as they do for Earth. When planets form matter falls down on them and impacts, so they tend to be very hot from absorbing all that and they may have a steady flow of meteor impacts adding some heat. Between radioactive materials and impacts a planet may be warm, and retain warm pockets deep beneath its surface. There’s also tidal heating. If a planet has a moon, and Pluto does, actually it has several, then the constant distortions of gravity yanking on the world can keep it quite warm. This is what keeps Jupiter’s moon Io a ball of molten lava. So while surface life walking around breathing air probably isn’t in the cards with anything like normal Earth-life there could be deep and massive oceans on these planets. Indeed we’re pretty sure Pluto does have underground oceans and that even it largest moon, Charon, might have some. 

Where you’ve got liquid water being churned around with minerals dissolved in it you have the possibility for life. We still don’t know what started life on Earth, or if our main candidates of underwater thermal vents, so called black smokers, are the only way for it to emerge if that is what started things off here. But regardless of how it gets started, once in place life could be able to thrive in any ocean so long as there’s some power source stirring up the water. Throughout this series we’ll see that there’s a lot of candidates for that which wouldn’t even qualify as a dwarf planet like Pluto, let alone an Earth-sized planet. Now complex life, especially intelligent tool users, is a different story. Ocean life obviously can’t support fire or many other technology precursors like metallurgy, pottery, glass blowing, and even basic chemistry. It is kind of hard to mix solutions in water. There’s also the matter of ‘thriving’ being somewhat relative. We have a long and dense food chain because everything runs on abundant sunlight. If you’re familiar with life down in caves or the deep ocean you know those are all optimized to run on very little energy and they still get most of that from debris flowing down from where there is sunlight. Some life-bearing Pluto equivalent could easily have less than a percent of our biomass and still all spread out and it is rather hard to develop a civilization when you are spread out. Our hunter gatherers needed around a square mile per person to live, far more in tundra or desert climates, and that limited them a lot on developing. If you’re a hundred or a thousand times more spread out to gather food you’d have some serious roadblocks to forming civilizations. So we can’t rule it out, but where simple life, and even animal life, are reasonable expectations off worlds like Pluto that expectation would have to be far smaller where anything really complex like us is concerned. The next thing to consider is what to we mean by worlds like Pluto. Pluto’s small, smaller than our own moon even. It’s cold. And it has a large moon that isn’t just tidally locked to it, but to which it is tidally locked to as well. Which of those factors apply to what we’ve been talking about? 

Well a bigger planet, say Earth transported out there and left to orbit for a billion years, would behave a lot differently. It will have a thicker atmosphere, Pluto has one but barely worth mentioning, just like the moon has one. Earth’s atmosphere contains virtually no hydrogen except where it’s locked up in a molecule like water or methane because molecular hydrogen doesn’t stick around on warm planets. But it’s the most common substance in the universe so an Earth Mass planet could easily have ocean and atmospheres made of molecular hydrogen. It would probably be warmer too, since heat loss in a vacuum is all about surface area. More surface, more heat loss. Pluto might have only about 0.2% of Earth’s Mass but it has nearly 3% of its surface area, a 15:1 higher ratio. So when it comes to heat derived from radioactive decays bigger planets will stay warmer. If we’re pondering a low-temperature life form that uses liquid or gaseous hydrogen instead of air or water the way we do you could have life swimming around in surface oceans of Earth-Mass worlds that weren’t even near a star. 

As to a Pluto-like world in mass and composition near a star, it would probably evaporate. 

Pluto is more like a giant comet then a planet or asteroid. Another reason it has a relatively large surface area, it just isn’t very dense. But a less massive world than Earth, even one less massive then Mars, can actually retain a thick atmosphere. There’s a misconception we get from the Moon and Mars that gravity is key factor there, which it mostly is, but there’s a lot more leeway on it then people tend to think. We’ll discuss that in a future video on life for more or less massive planets. Last thing. What about colonizing a place like Pluto? Can we, with the kind of technology we have now or can reasonable predict we might get live on a place like Pluto? The answer is basically a straight YES. Even without some power source like fusion, or old school nuclear fission, we can power ourselves there. Burning hydrogen and oxygen, or methane and oxygen specifically on Pluto isn’t very viable because there’s not a lot of oxygen around except as water but there is some and other Pluto-like worlds might have more. Plus not everything needs oxygen to burn, for instance the spacecraft flying by Pluto right now has Hydrazine thrusters, and that’s a mix of nitrogen and hydrogen, both abundant on Pluto, and doesn’t need oxygen to create thrust and heat. So chemical power isn’t totally ruled out even for Pluto let alone other parallel worlds. Nor is solar power. The sunlight out there is barely a thousandth of what it is here, in intensity, but one watt per square meter is still nothing to shrug at. That’s actually brighter than the night under a full moon. 

A 10 watt LED light in a room in your house is delivering light comparable to what you get from the sun out there, so it isn’t dark. What’s more, you’ve got options like solar mirrors. The idea of creating planet-sized mirrors to reflect more sunlight onto a world sounds very crazy but when you’re talking about mirrors that only need to be as thick as paper, or even thinner, manufacturing ones the size of whole planets can be done with less mass than you’d have in even a very small moon no bigger than a modest mountain on Earth. If you’ve seen my original YouTube video, Megastructures, then you know doing something like that is actually very modest compared to some of the projects we envision getting ourselves up to in the future. So even if we never figure out fusion these freezing cold worlds aren’t necessarily off our radar to put habitations on, though obviously that would be ideal followed by good old fission power with something like Uranium or Thorium. Gravity isn’t an issue either. It’s very low on Pluto, about 7% of Earth normal, compared to 16% on the Moon. But as we also mentioned in that Megastructures video, centrifugal or spin-gravity isn’t limited to use just in zero or micro-gravity environments. Instead of using a spinning cylinder you just slope the floors to combine natural gravity with spin. Just like how water in your washing machine will form a slope surface when spinning as gravity and centrifugal forces add their power together, you can do that on low gravity worlds to create an effective decent gravity. 

You don’t need to build sturdy surface domes either, you dig in a few hundred feet deep on Pluto and the pressure of the ice over you will keep pockets of air at normal Earth pressures. This would also protect you from cosmic rays and micro-meteors in the absence of an atmosphere and magnetosphere. You’d have to artificially light and heat the place so you could grow food but we can do pretty dense and efficient hydroponics when we need to. So, in summary, can we colonize a place like Pluto? Yes. Can life evolve their naturally? Quite possibly, though not likely anything we could chat with. I hope you’ve enjoyed this first video on planetary habitability.

Fermi Paradox Apocalypse How
---
  
2015-05-04  
https://youtu.be/zmbldpqn0K4  

---

In the previous video we outlined all the major solutions to the Fermi Paradox. 

If you haven’t watched that yet, this video is meant as a stand alone, but it would probably help to watch that first. 

As a reminder, the Fermi Paradox is the apparent contradiction between the seemingly high probability of alien civilizations existing and the total absence of any solid evidence that they do exist. 

Or as Enrico Fermi put it, if there are tons of alien civilizations, “Where is everybody?” We outlined a lot of proposed solutions in that video from us just not knowing what to look for to find them to them going out of their way to hide themselves or us just refusing to believe evidence right under our noses. 

However one of the more popular solutions revolves around the idea that alien civilizations are terribly uncommon, either because they rarely develop civilization or because they almost always go extinct. 

Today we’ll be looking at the latter option. 

If you’re alive, today, in the 21st century, and watching Youtube, then you have already been exposed to virtually ever apocalyptic scenario imaginable. 

Hollywood does a wonderful job blowing stuff up for our entertainment. 

We’re going to go over some of these and see how realistic they are. 

But we’re not interested in some of these cases because they don’t really matter in terms of the Fermi Paradox. 

For instance, portrayal of genetic superman wiping out mankind is really an irrelevancy as far as Fermi’s Paradox is concerned because highly aggressive genetic supermen are just as likely to go expanding out into the wider universe as we are. 

Doomsday’s for humanity that replace us with another intelligence that has survival and propagation as motives just don’t matter for Fermi’s Paradox. 

And as we previously discussed in the Dyson Dilemma video even a singular intelligence which didn’t want to reproduce has good motivations to expand itself. 

We’re looking for something that ends civilization. 

Not civilization as we know it, but just destroys any intelligence with the desire and capacity for expanding into space. 

So for instance a swarm of self-replicating robots with the technology for interstellar travel but nothing approaching a civilization is a Fermi Paradox concern, alternatively a complex and ancient civilization which arose after a nuclear war and bans any 20th century technology and enforces those bans rigorously is not. 

One could argue in that latter case though, that anyone who bans technology because of some cataclysmic event is going to have problems enforcing that over very long times. 

Societies mutate on a generational basis, and especially without solid worldwide communications you’d expect to see a lot of schism and fracturing. 

Even keeping an orthodoxy for a thus an years seems hard, but planets exist for billions of years and the simple fact is that, all things being equal, a group which starts ignoring the tech bans are going to start gaining a massive economic and military edge. 

So we’re going to go over a lot of these doomsday scenarios and discussing not so much how likely they are to occur but how likely they are to take a civilization down entirely for keeps. 

It’s hard to really classify civilization destroying events but we are going to give it a go. 

Here’s the one’s I’ve selected are: Nuclear War Bioterrorism Post-Apocalyptic Attrition Cyclical Apocalypse Climate Change Artificial Intelligence Grey Goo Anti-Matter Suicide Pact Technology Mind Control One thing we’ll be mostly avoiding is social matters. 

Not only are these hard to predict, and as we pointed out, prone to very rapid change on stellar timelines, but they get pretty controversial because they get political. 

Everyone’s mileage varies on such things and there’s not really a rigorous approach available to analyze such things, so we’ll just leave it be so the comments section under the video doesn’t get full of invective. 

By the way I do read all the comments on these videos and try to reply to them, so please feel free to leave a comment below. 

So, Nuclear War. 

This is one we’re all pretty familiar with but like a lot of disasters in movies it tends not to get portrayed very accurately. 

Nuclear bombs are devastating, but fundamentally, even at the height of the cold war, there just weren’t enough to kill off civilization for keeps. 

Nuclear bombs kill many, collapse present society, and leave long-lasting damage to the ecosystem. 

However, they don’t get everybody, and in most estimates don’t even get half. 

Starvation and chaos will get far more, but ironically are less of a threat the more people die initially. 

We’ll cover this more in the Post-Apocalyptic Attrition segment but it basically boils down having some surviving settlements that eke their way through the centuries it takes for the planet to recover. 

Fundamentally, just as with our own Dark Ages, these periods simply are very short compared to the timespan planets exist for. 

If some world had beat us modern civilization by a mere million years, an eyeblink compared to the Age of the Universe, even if it took them a thousand years to recover from a nuclear was and even if they repeated the process 10 or 12 times before learning better, or running out of uranium, they’d still have burned up only a percent or two of their headstart on us. 

Now a sufficiently large nuclear device, or nuclear arsenal, could kill everyone. 

We can’t rule this out but there’s a host of hurdles to building an arsenal that’s simply far bigger than you need to destroy your enemy ten times over again. 

Nukes are expensive to build and maintain, arsenals on that scale are basically deadman switches designed to convince an enemy that attacking is suicide, people are very interested in their own survival and would tend to build in massive safeguards. 

We never built such things, odds are good few others would either and the Fermi Paradox is all about the odds. 

If 1 species does this but 9 others don’t, it doesn’t really matter. 

So fundamentally nuclear war, at least with the technology so far devised, isn’t a terribly good Fermi Paradox solution. 

So what about biowarfare? 

The same conditions apply to any virus that doesn’t get everyone, but we can’t rule out someone designing a virus that does get everyone. 

And it really does need to get everyone. 

If even 1 in a million are immune that still leaves thousands of people alive. 

They’d be scattered all over but since vast amounts of technology and resources would be kicking around intact it would only be a matter of time before lonely people started making efforts to link up with each other. 

When you’ve got months or years to contemplate the problem you don’t need to be a genius to think of lighting beacon fires on top of skyscrapers or using a radio tower to broadcast to others. 

And that’s assuming no one had enough time during the crisis to start taking measures like telling the survivors how to link up or get people into a sealed environment with resource stockpiles. 

And if the immunity was more like 1% you wouldn’t even need special measures to link people up into groups big enough to survive and breed. 

So it would have to a 100% kill. 

And that’s not really a natural or accidental lab accident sort of result. 

You’d almost have to have a large and well-funded group set out to intentionally kill every single person on the planet. 

Outside of Hollywood that’s not terrible tenable. 

The bigger the group, the better the odds of someone changing their mind and informing authorities. 

Even if we grant all that though, we still have three problems in the context of the Fermi Paradox. 

First, not every alien species is likely to do this. 

Just like with nuclear war, it doesn’t matter if 1 in 10 does if 9 in 10 don’t, and even if it were 9 in 10, or 99 in 100 that did this it still wouldn’t really matter much to the Fermi Paradox because if you have a thousand or so civilizations arising in a billion years per galaxy even if 99.9% did this to themselves you’d still have one left over who didn’t. 

Second, when we’re working in the context that intelligence tends to develop fairly commonly, then wipe itself out, which is what Doomsday approaches to the Fermi Paradox revolve around, then wiping out all humans with a virus would still leave other intelligent mammals around who would, if intelligence evolving is common, replace us. 

It might take a million years, or ten million years, or even a hundred million years but even a hundred million years isn’t that long compared to the age of the Universe or this planet. 

It’s around 1%. 

Third, we also have to remember that viruses might not really be a universal threat. 

Viruses are present in, and a threat to, every environment and organism on Earth. 

But that doesn’t mean they’d be an automatic threat in all life-bearing worlds to the degree they are to us. 

A given species might have much more effective immune systems or a biology which is just very toughened against dying from infection. 

So this type of apocalypse also isn’t’ a really good Fermi Paradox solution. 

This takes us to Post-Apocalyptic Attrition, which is less of a specific Apocalypse and more about recovery. 

One common theme of disasters is that you often get more damage done in the aftermath than the actual incident itself. 

In fiction in particularly we’ll have rioting mobs or in the aftermath roving brigands who basically steal to live and destroy any stable bastions of civilization they encounter. 

This results in a steady attrition just pushing us down till no one is left. 

Now the problem here is you can only kill so many people before theft-to-live is no longer viable. 

Once your numbers get down to hunter-gatherer levels, a few square miles per person, it now is not only no longer necessary to kill people to get food but also a bad strategy. 

Deer won’t shoot you, and if all that’s left of civilization are the people who’ve survived the bloodbath odds are good those survivors can and will shoot you. 

You’ve also got the problem that an organized and disciplined group that’s been keeping around people who have other values besides fighting, like repairing stuff and treating injuries, is going to butcher the stereotypical post-apocalyptic Mad Max tribe of techno-savages in a fight. 

So eventually attrition slows down, and it is basically bound to do this while the numbers are still high enough that people still regularly encounter each other so you really can’t push a population down below breeding-level viability through attrition. 

After a while, even if they’ve lost all their technology, and especially if they lost it all, they just revert to hunter gather tribes. 

A setback, but presumably of thousands of years at most. 

And it would probably be a lot less, because examples of technology, rusty or not, are going to be lying around everywhere and you can fit pretty much every major bit of science and technology up to the 20th century into books which would take up a small chest. 

Heck you can download the entire Wikipedia database free of charge onto a single thumb drive. 

But you’d be bound to have caches set aside by people of this variety and even if you didn’t you don’t need to be nearly as smart as the guys who designed the internal combustion engine to reverse engineer it from some rusty remnant. 

Our own buried landfills, unlikely to be pillaged in an apocalyptic aftermath, would contain everything you needed. 

So you would expect civilization to recover eventually, and sooner than later, in any doomsday which left enough of us alive to breed and was still ecologically intact enough to support life. 

But having killed themselves once, what’s stopping them from doing it again? 

Cyclical apocalypses, natural or unnatural, are a real concern. 

We’ve got some great examples of this in fiction (Pern, Nightfall, Mote in God’s Eye) and of course these being fiction tend to either focus on breaking the recurring cycle or if more bleak and dark, on the futility of trying breaking out of the cycle. 

But how probable is this? 

That’s really hard to say. 

If a civilization arises, nukes itself nearly out of existence, recovers over thousands of years, then does it again, what’s to stop them doing it again, and again, and again? 

Well I mentioned half-jokingly early you’d eventually run out of enriched uranium to build nukes with. 

Radioactive isotopes decay with time, that’s why they are rare to begin with, not much left over from the ancient supernovas that spawned them, and if you’ve being mining every source of them for cycles of nuclear warfare you will run out. 

But fundamentally its really hard to eliminate all traces of a civilization. 

Even if every single historical account is burned or bastardized into mythology that barely resembles what really happened you going to start having increasing amounts of archeological and even geological records. 

It would be hard to miss evidence that every ten thousand or so years for the last couple million years civilization had gotten technological then knocked itself back to primitive hunter-gatherer remnants. 

And even that’s a pretty unrealistic scenario. 

We really do have bunker-archives, even back to the Crypt of Civilization built in Georgia in 1936, which would be usable guides to reforging civilization even thousands of years after they were built. 

These sorts of time-capsules and caches probably would survive almost any doomsday scenario that left people alive. 

If you’re pessimist you can come up with ways these might fail to survive or just be disbelieved but intelligent critters are usually very survival oriented and it’s hard for me, personally, to imagine such cycles just going on and on uninterrupted for thousands of cycles till the world got burned up by the sun. 

Our next one is climate change. 

This is politically controversial so we’re going to keep this short, like I said I like people to leave me comments on the videos but I don’t invite invective. 

Please take pro or anti climate change arguments elsewhere, plenty of other places to talk about that. 

Global warming for this is pretty straight forward anyway. 

It is possible climate change could leave a world dead, rendered either as a snowball Earth or Runaway Greenhouse Venus setup. 

We don’t know. 

If  this is possible then everybody’s dead and it’s a decent Fermi Paradox option. 

Except that it would require every species does let this happen and that’s counter-indicated because even if they all would, its not really a given all could. 

Our fossils fuels are the product of a very long and complex geological process. 

Underwater oil deposits often rupture and leak out, underground coal seams can burn. 

So there’s really nothing saying every world would have as much of these items as we do when technological life arose. 

They might be immune to the problem because they don’t much. 

Plus the individual configurations of the planets, its distance from the sun, its type of sun, i’s own default atmosphere, and so on, might make it immune to such problems. 

They might live on a world with a dozen times more atmospheric carbon then we already have and that’s what lets it be warm enough for life. 

Their world might be very prone to earthquakes compared to us and all the easy deposits of fuels ruptured. 

Add to that, if it wouldn’t wipe out all life but was recoverable over time, then civilization would recover and wouldn’t have those deposits for technology round 2. 

Now that’s a problem because we used those to get to our present technological state, but we did have renewable fuels before we used these, like alcohol or ethanol, firewood, and so on. 

You can’t support as many people in the short term, and fuel is more expensive, but this probably would just slow technological process, not halt it. 

And again centuries or even tens of thousands of years mean nothing in the timeline of the universe. 

So this also isn’t a good Fermi-Paradox solution. 

Our next one, Artificial Intelligence, also really isn’t. 

As we mentioned earlier and in previous videos, replacing one intelligence with another doesn’t mean anything to the Fermi Paradox unless its motives are so different that it doesn’t act in any way which would emulate either of the three basically universal rules of natural life. 

That it very focused on surviving, that it wants to reproduce, and that it wants to expand its resources and territory. 

An AI which didn’t care about tis own survival isn’t likely to replace the species that birthed it, and we discussed in the Dyson Dilemma video why even one which didn’t want to reproduce itself would still tend to functionally emulate an expanding and growing species. 

So AI really only matters in the sense of being an apocalypse which kills it and us. 

The big problem with this is that an AI which is smarter than us, a Strong AI, is smarter than us. 

In Hollywood these AI’s run numbers quickly but are generally absolute morons when it comes to social interaction. 

A real strong AI probably isn’t going to scare us because it will be smart enough to emulate a very pleasant, helpful, and non-threatening friend. 

An AI planning to take over the world is probably a lot more likely to get the courts to rule it legally a person and convince people to vote it president in landslide election then to go all SkyNet or Matrix on us. 

If it wants us all dead, we’d probably never know it till it acted and the outcome would be about as predetermined as fighting off an alien invasion by a species set on genocide and capable of interstellar travel. 

Which is to say the ‘battle’ would last about ten minutes. 

Which is to say, you don’t beat a smarter, bigger, more technologically advanced group in a one-on-one fight unless its goal isn’t to kill you in the first place. 

If it just wants you dead, and doesn’t care about the property damage, an interstellar ship doesn’t even need to fire any guns. 

It just has to jettison some of its mass aimed at Earth before it starts slowing down. 

Because a few thousands tons of garbage moving at relativistic speeds and hitting Earth would make a nuclear war look like a barroom scuffle in comparison. 

A machine doesn’t need an intact biosphere to live so it can go all scorched Earth. 

Hard to beat an enemy who is smarter than you and has a much freer hand where collateral damage is concerned. 

So it’s really unlikely a fight with a machine mind would end in a mutual kill, and the survivor would pick itself up and recover, not a good Fermi Paradox option. 

Alternatively a stupid machine is. 

Grey Goo as its often called, microscopic little machines which are simply programmed to tear everything apart to make more of themselves, is an apocalypse scenario which fits into the Fermi Paradox. 

Though only if they’re too dumb to make it off world. 

This is a lot like the biowarfare option only far worse because there’s no immunity to being disassembled as scrap by a billion little robots who also disassemble all the animals, vegetables, and minerals. 

So Grey Goo is a real concern. 

Two caveats in the context of the Fermi Paradox though. 

First, there’s no reason to assume that even if Grey Goo starts off mindless it would stay that way. 

We, ourselves, are essentially descended from Grey Goo. 

Early life just mindlessly ate anything it could to reproduce. 

It mutated and grew in complexity. 

Grey Goo would also likely be capable of mutation, it’s basically unavoidable in replicating life or machines. 

Now Grey Goo reproduces a lot faster than biological life, if it didn’t it wouldn’t be a threat. 

So it might climb the evolutionary chain to intelligence much faster. 

Of course it might be exponentially less prone to mutation too which might cause the reverse. 

But from a certain light Grey Goo is just a life reset akin to when oxygen breathers became the norm for life on Earth. 

The other caveat is that self-replicating machines are probably not the boogey-man we make them out to be. 

Just because something can replicate faster than biological life doesn’t mean it can replicate absurdly quickly. 

There’s waste heat involved in any mechanical process. 

Try bending a metal coat hanger back and forth several times quickly till it breaks and sticking your finger at the snap point. 

You’ll burn your hand. 

They’d be limited to how fast they could rip stuff apart without melting themselves. 

Second, you’re probably aware that electronic devices are sensitive to EMP bursts. 

You can harden electronics against this but only to a point. 

Especially with tiny machines adding in all that shielding is just going to slow its ability to reproduce down because now it needs more resources for each new machine and more time to make it and fewer can cluster together for each disassembly. 

If they’re dumb, you can fight them, if they’re smart, they’re wired together as a group consciousness, which makes them smart and thus not a Fermi Paradox solution, and also makes them sensitive to signal jamming too. 

So you probably can’t end the world from someone accidentally dropping a vial of the things to shatter on the concrete and go on a blitzkrieg. 

You can also nuke them. 

Nukes beat matter every time. 

Nuclear forces and energies are just orders of magnitude more powerful then chemical bonds that bind matter. 

That takes us to our next one. 

If there’s one thing out their nastier than nuclear bombs in destructive potential its anti-matter. 

A baseball size and mass of antimatter, dropped to the ground, would go off with a destructive blast on par with the largest nuclear devices we’ve ever made. 

They release all their mass energy, whereas nukes release not even a percent of theirs. 

This is exactly what makes interstellar ships so dangerous and why hard science fiction fans often chuckle the notion of an ‘unarmed ship’. 

Anything going out at those kind of speeds is worth more than its weight in nukes in destructive power because the energies involved in those kind of speeds parallel mass energy, Einstein’s famous E-mc-squared. 

You could blow up a fair sized city with just the antimatter that would fit inside a ballpoint pen’s interior. 

So as a Fermi-paradox solution we’d have to consider what would happen if this substance became very easy to manufacture and hide. 

Right now anti-matter is very hard to make. 

As powerful as it is a single gram, the mass of a pea, is parallel to the Hiroshima bomb. 

But it is so hard to make it would take us a billion years at present production to make that gram and we would have no way to store it. 

That could change, we could find a way to produce it and store it cheaply and efficiently and covertly and that would make it the ultimate terrorist device. 

Now, we’re not doing a separate section on 3D printing but 3D printing, while a marvel, comes with some attached concerns. 

In theory, when fully developed, you can produce anything at home if you have the template. 

So easy availability by lone crackpots to anti-matter, to 3D printers that could fabricate destructive devices, and so on, could make it virtually impossible to maintain a technological civilization because it becomes too easy for lone members to damage it and we have no shortage of lunatics. 

This becomes a possible Fermi Paradox solution in the sense of species having to step back because they just can’t maintain technological infrastructure to support interstellar travel without being constantly vulnerable to their own crazy persons wreaking disproportionate destruction. 

Our last category, mind control, will ponder that some more, but we have one other category first, and like antimatter it revolves around very powerful energy sources. 

Suicide Pact Technology is essentially any tech that just by using it guarantees destruction. 

Some people say that internal combustion engines or antibiotics or nuclear power or computers are these things. 

This category in this video though refers more to technologies that look too good to be true and turn out to be apocalyptic. 

You might remember some years back the concern people had about the CERN supercollider making a black hole that would sink the center of the earth and gobble up the planet. 

I’m not going to address all the flaws in that idea but let’s hypothesize someone invented some powerplant that sucked energy out of seemingly nowhere for free. 

Unbeknownst to them this really cool device sets off a ticking time bomb that blows the planet to smithereens a year after use in a way no one can foresee. 

If the physics allowing this device were almost impossible not to discover before space travel was really practical, like how you almost can’t avoid discovering computers before you can make orbital satellites, then every species figures it out, uses it, and blows themselves up before they can expand into the stars. 

Total Fermi Paradox solution. 

And  again some feel computers, and AI, are an example of this. 

Or fossil fuels. 

Or Nukes. 

As we’ve been discussing throughout the video. 

Suicide Pact Technology isn’t a specific apocalypse but the notion of a technology that unavoidable kills its users and unavoidably gets discovered soon enough to kill them. 

How plausible is this? 

Well, like any Fermi Paradox solution we have to consider if it covers all the bases. 

WE haven’t discovered any technology to the point of definite death yet and we really could build a Moon Base or Mars Base if we wanted, probably one that could keep going even if Earth ceased to exist. 

And other alien worlds might have their interplanetary neighbors be closer, might have lower gravity or thinner air to make orbital launch easier. 

So  besides us having nor real reason to believe there’s any Suicide Pact Technology that can and will always destroy a world there would probably be examples of critters who had reached our effective technological level and already gotten a splinter colony on another world in their system. 

So even this isn’t really a great Fermi Paradox Solution. 

Our last category is mind control. 

As we mentioned in the anti-matter section you’ve got to worry, inside a technological civilization, about crazy individuals being able to wreak vast damage. 

One solution to that, if you have the technology, would be to have a total big brother state or even outright mind control. 

And certainly there are even more sinister reasons someone might want to use this sort of technology. 

Now in of itself this is irrelevant to the Fermi Paradox. 

But specific types of mind control would be. 

For instance, a culture that’s gotten burned by technology might use mind control to permanently lock technological progress at a ‘safe’ level too low for interstellar travel. 

Or, similarly, they might outright ban expansion because they can’t reliable maintain that enforced orthodoxy over light years of space and communication lag. 

They don’t trust any colony not to splinter off and become a threat down the road. 

It’s very hard to rule two islands, so to speak, because one of those islands will constantly be wanting to break free and maybe that potential threat just isn’t worth the risk for the resources it brings you, and interstellar space isn’t a planet, moving resources is a hugely long and hard process. 

So  any sort of mind control or social control that results in motives not to expand and could reliably keep enforcing that for millions of years is a valid Fermi Paradox solution but only where there’s a universal motive, since it has to be all or nearly all aliens doing it, and that would rally only apply where there was a clear suicide pact technology on the horizon. 

So there we go. 

In summary, we looked at possible doomsday scenarios for what might take out intelligent life and we’ve seen that there’s not many good fits, in terms of the Fermi Paradox, for things which would get most let alone all intelligent species. 

I hope you’ve enjoyed this video, fell free to check out some of my others or leave comments below.

Fermi Paradox Solutions

2015-02-17

---

What we’ll be doing here today is reviewing some of the more common proposed solutions to the Fermi Paradox – which is essentially the question ‘if there are aliens, why can’t we see them?’ – and look over some of the strengths and weaknesses of those solutions. 

There are a lot of them so we’ll be moving fairly quickly over each, and we’ll also loosely categorize them into some groups. 

No grouping is really ideal but they are helpful so here are the ones I’ve selected: Category 1: Alien Civilizations are Incredibly Uncommon. 

There are no alien civilizations, or they are so incredibly rare that most galaxies have never spawned one. 

Category 2: They are common but hard to see. 

There are alien civilizations but we can’t hear them. 

Category 3: They exist and are not hard to see. 

We interact with them routinely but most or all don’t realize it. 

Category 4: Miscellaneous. 

Or in more generalized form, Category 1, we can’t see aliens because they don’t exist, Category 2 we can’t see them because we’re not looking hard enough or in the right way, category 3 we can’t see them because we’re being tricked or tricking ourselves, and category 4 we have a massive flaw in our logic where this paradox is concerned. 

Category 1 we’ll cover pretty quickly because first I recently did a lengthy video discussing it in enormous detail and second it’s the camp I loosely align to so I’m not great at criticizing it. 

But inside Category 1 you basically have three subdivisions. 

1A: The conditions needed to achieve complex life are much less common than we assume. 

1B: Intelligence is not a common outcome of evolution, or Intelligence does not lead to technological civilizations. 

1C: Intelligence in this Universe does not occur naturally. 

Category 1A is fairly broad but essentially comes down to the notion of Great Filters and the Rare Earth Hypothesis. 

In the Fermi Paradox a Great Filter is something which assumes a lot of steps on the road to becoming a technological civilization and staying there for long enough to be seen and heard. 

Sometimes this is a single filter, like an assumption all or nearly all civilizations nuke themselves out of existence within a century of making a nuclear bomb, but just as often it can be a series of filters that each have a large chance of enduring the journey. 

1 in 10 stars can host habitable planets, one in ten of those worlds develop life, one tenth of those get complex life, one tenth of those luck out on some cataclysm or change that wipes out complex life too frequently to go further or makes it so it can’t continue, one tenth develop life with significant brains, one tenth of those achieve intelligence, one tenth of those develop technology, and one tenth of those avoid wiping themselves out. 

That’s 8 one tenths, or 1 in 100 million. 

Which would still result in several thousands of civilizations in this galaxy alone but if the odds were one in a hundred each step that would be less than one per several thousand galaxies and explain why we hadn’t detected them. 

There’s also potential criteria that might be uncommon but required for complex life, like having a large moon or Jupiter to vacuum up space debris so it doesn’t rain down on the planet regularly or that conditions on planets are very prone to toppling out of habitability. 

Here are some of those, and again we won’t really be challenging these as much as we will in other categories: Planetary habitable zones are narrow and move as stars age. 

We classify habitable zones basically as where liquid water can exist on something of near-Earth size but that’s a pretty big guess, and planets don’t move in circular orbits but ellipses. 

Planets might ice over or tilt into runaway greenhouse effects far more easily then we currently assume. 

Additionally, the luminosity of stars changes over time, they get brighter, that pushes the habitable zone outward. 

Many also fluctuate in brightness much more than our Sun, and give off regular deluges of light, like XUV radiation, which is inimical to life, not just Earth life but any life based on regular chemistry. 

Jovian planets are rare: The notion that a planet will get bombarded by asteroids without some other larger body around to pull those in is a fairly valid one but this idea has fallen out of favor as a strong filter because we’ve detected so many planets in other solar systems that parallel Jupiter in size and location to perform the vacuum cleaner function. 

Large moons are rare: Earth’s own moon is very nearly a double planet and it has a huge impact on our environment in terms of tides, weather, our axial tilt, and so on. 

It is usually assumed that early land life evolved from creatures that had evolved to handle tide pools. 

No big moon, no tides. 

Geological events have to be just right for complex life: A planet with no volcanoes or plate tectonics is going to erode away into a massive flat mudball or landless sea which is not well suited for diverse complex life let alone tool using life. 

And we have many others. 

Cells with nuclei develop rarely, specialized organisms with distinct organs are not common, galaxies are volatile place which often expose worlds to sterilizing blasts of radiation, and so on. 

Individually one of these might be a Great Filter that fewer than one in a billion pass or they may each just be something that just drops the odds of life by an order or two of magnitude which adds up to making complex life rare. 

The big ‘flaw’ here is that we really just don’t know the odds and none of them seem to work as a single Great Filter. 

None of those really seem like one in a billion type things and many are not even indicated to be less likely than not, let alone highly improbable, so stacking them all into a sequence that makes complex life rare is sort of like assuming the worst case scenario has happened each step along the way. 

Category 1B: That intelligence or technological civilizations are rare isn’t necessarily separate from 1A, since it can just be additional layers of filtering, but is distinct in that it argues that technological civilizations may be a freak anomaly and not an inevitable end goal of evolution. 

Now, of course, evolutions does not have end goals but it does tend to produce increased complexity and sophistication and we often assume intelligence to be one of those and technology inevitable from that. 

The other chunk of 1B is that tech civs might be uncommon because they inevitably take themselves out through nukes, biological warfare, runaway self-replicating machines, and so on. 

1B is complicated because ‘intelligence’ is a bit hard to define. 

Humans are the only ‘intelligent’ life on Earth but of course are not. 

Besides other primates like chimpanzees we have cats, dogs, dolphins, elephants, pigs, raccoons, and many other creatures who we’re tens of millions of years away from in terms of common ancestors and yet have clear intelligence, problem solving abilities, and even tool use or building skills. 

Many have had this level of intelligence for a very, very long time even on geological timelines and yet never carried it any further. 

Now many assume humans just hit the complex tool use level first and that if we disappeared eventually one of them would get there but our brains, with the large, folded forebrain and cerebral cortex is a pretty big jump and there are a lot of little factors in our biology that probably contributed to our rise as a technological civilization which are peculiar or sometimes even harmful to us. 

We have large heads with skulls that are soft so they can expand later, and this is very dangerous for live birth, additionally that soft skull probably is a big factor in the plasticity of our brains which is very associated to learning, and a need for learning since you don’t have as many wired instincts. 

It’s not just that you can learn, it is that you must learn. 

We are omnivores, cats aren’t, they can probably never develop specialist societies because they can’t support a dense population through agriculture and everything they eat is terrified of them making it probably fairly hard to get into tending livestock. 

Even if you get the brain, and tool use, which we’ve had for hundreds of thousands of years, you might not use technology much. 

We have fire, but that might not be popular. 

We cook our food, which allows us store meat longer and also let’s us digest certain types of it better to derive more nutrient from it. 

A given critter might hate the taste of cooked food. 

Or the oxygen content of their world might be a little higher making forest fires the most dreaded bane and the very idea of someone keeping it around the tribe considered the equivalent of juggling hand grenades. 

Fire’s dangerous as is, but its exponentially more so as oxygen concentrations rise and you need it for technology. 

Some worlds, from different levels of tectonic activity or erosion, or just composition, might not have easy to find copper to make those first metal tools limiting you to flint and wood, which can not be used to make some tools well enough to make them better than employing old school methods. 

Pottery will never develop if you don’t have fire either. 

Planets with no seasons, or very mild ones, will not require means of preserving food. 

Tidally locked worlds will never see the stars where life can live, so no astrology or astronomy, or the world might have thin clouds almost constantly. 

The world might not have large deposit of fossil fuels. 

And so on. 

So essentially Category 1B challenges the idea that evolution will inevitably spawn technology, and throws in the caveat that technology might also inevitably kill a world too. 

Its big flaw is that we while we know evolution we really don’t have a clue about the probabilities involved on given steps nor do we know if we might stumble across some bit of seemingly great technology that amounts to signing a suicide contract by employing it. 

Self-replicating robots, a power source that makes fusion look shoddy but blows up a planet after a few years of operation, etc. 

Category 1C, that Intelligence in this Universe does not occur naturally, covers more of the supernatural cases though also includes the extreme version of 1B that a freak anomaly had to occur, rather than an improbable but natural evolutionary jump. 

If you’ve ever heard of Boltzmann Brain, essentially the notion that over a long enough time in a big enough place random events could make a computer assemble not through evolution but just freak odds, that’s basically the reasoning there. 

But this category includes ‘God did it’, or ‘aliens in a prior universe with different rules made this one’, or the near equivalent, that we’re running in a simulation of a universe where the laws differ from the simulators and intelligence would not naturally develop so they tweaked us specifically so it would. 

If we wanted to simulate a universe on giant computers where, say, the speed of light was 10% higher and found out that life could exist but just couldn’t naturally evolve, that the steps to get there were just too improbable to occur, we might just throw them in ready-made on one world to see what happened afterwards. 

1C is not the scientifically popular realm but in truth many of the other solutions we’ll see are much akin so leaving it out would be unfair. 

It has the obvious flaw that there’s no scientific evidence to support and that most versions are ‘internally unprovable’, meaning that while an outside force that did it can come on down and say ‘hi’ you can’t, inside the box, ever show that’s what’s going on. 

Even in the case of a Boltzmann brain, one that assembled complete from particles with no evolutionary steps, it would be on sound ground to wonder if someone made it rather than assuming it was an astronomically improbable fluke event, even though it knows that is possible. 

A clock can assemble naturally, the odds of this occurring are just very, very low so outside covert construction isn’t too absurd if you find one. 

So that’s category 1, we don’t see aliens because they are super rare or don’t even exist. 

Category 2, they are common but hard to see. 

There are alien civilizations but we can’t hear them. 

This is where most of the argument goes on and where we’ll spend most of our time. 

It’s harder to break into sub-categories but here are the major ones: 2A: They’ve got mouths but we lack ears. 

Typically that means they just don’t use radio for communication 2B: There just hasn’t been enough time for us to hear them. 

2C: They don’t talk because they have no reason to. 

2D: They hide, intentionally The biggest flaws going into category 2 are the Mediocrity Principle and the idea of Exclusivity. 

Mediocrity Principle we know, when you’ve only got one example of something you should assume it’s probably a fairly normal, or mediocre, example of such things. 

It comes into category 2 because frequently this category relies on choices and behavior of alien civilizations and they probably have little similarity to humans in many areas, they are, literally, alien. 

However they also just as probably have that same alien-ness to each other. 

A given alien civilization might act in some way, but others won’t. 

Unless that behavior is exclusive. 

As an example, we can assume that no species that ever explores the stars or settles other worlds hasn’t learned basic Newtonian physics, you need that to build rockets, you can’t avoid seeing it in action very simplistically in space even if you somehow got up there without it or evolved in an asteroid belt or deep space instead. 

There’s no air friction interfering with the basic process. 

So we can say that space travel is ‘exclusive’ to species who know Newtonian Physics. 

However, while many people believe in the inevitability of social progress to some predetermined and universal system of behavior, and often have some good arguments to back that, it’s pretty obvious that just among humans it is possible to get up into space with many different types of culture. 

So it is hard to argue that space travel is exclusive to democracies, or communist civilizations, or ones which have curbed population growth or given up war, etc. 

Space travel would seem to be non-exclusive of democracy, or human rights, or unchecked population growth, or so on. 

That last will come up a lot because as we discussed in the prior video, the Dyson Dilemma, if a species is prone to keep growing in numbers and territory, even if it’s a very slow growth, even if they are fairly rare they will soon become the super-majority of intelligent life. 

So you’ll hear me reference Non-Exclusivity with a lot of Category 2 solutions. 

2a: They’ve got mouths but we lack ears. 

Again, this typically that means they just don’t use radio for communication. 

This could include something faster than light or even instant, something like neutrinos that just go right through everything, or even just that they don’t use omnidirectional signals, which are pretty wasteful in most cases especially for long distance communication between two spots. 

Even if you’ve got a hundred colony systems around your homeworld it makes more sense to send a tight beam to each system rather than one big omnidirectional signal. 

They talk, but we don’t hear them because they’re talking in sign language and we’re listening with our ears basically. 

This is a pretty solid argument but it suffers from a few problems. 

First, if we don’t know what kind of new physics they are using to talk faster than light we’re not just assuming science we don’t have, we’re also assuming behavior based around something we don’t know. 

We have light speed communication. 

We have the internet but people still use fax machines and snail mail. 

We have TV but AM radio remains strong. 

The ability to send instant messages across the stars could be much more expensive, byte for byte, then radio and if so you’d still use that on your planet. 

We don’t know how this thing which breaks known physical laws would operate so it’s a huge jump to say that’s what’s going on. 

Second, this hits the problem in the Dyson Dilemma. 

We may well not be able to hear signals from an alien homeworld, even if they were in mundane radio, but if they are expansionist we don’t need to listen for their homeworld radio, we just need to listen for their colonies. 

Biological life tends to grow with time, when it has the resources to do so and no external pressure stopping them, over a long enough period you don’t need to look thousands of light years away for alien radio signals, you just need to look at any star nearby because they colonized it or someone else did. 

Indeed, there’s no obvious reason you’d need to listen for radio to see those nearby worlds either because they will probably be tapping that star for energy by surrounding it with solar collectors and artificial habitats. 

The Dyson Dilemma basically says it doesn’t matter if we can hear their phone, because any pro-growth civilization decently older than us is going to have surrounded their star and many nearby ones with Dyson Spheres or Dyson Swarms and just keep slowly expanding so you can’t miss them. 

And this is where non-exclusivity comes in. 

Unless one can show that the ability to engage in serious expansion of your own planet is exclusive to species which are no growth or destined to be no growth not long after, then it would only take one species, or even on sub-culture of a species, that was pro-growth to ensure this expansion happened. 

Now, as we mentioned earlier, many people do believe certain behaviors are inevitable as a part of social progress, if you believe that includes no growth even when you can, then category 2A is quite reasonable, if you believe it is not inevitable for all intelligent life, then 2A, and most of category 2, is shot down. 

And again watch the other video if you want that explained in detail. 

This also discusses the problem where civilizations kill themselves off in short order, which again hits the idea of Non-Exclusivity unless you subscribe to that being an inevitable event by any technological species. 

We will assume here that inevitable no growth or inevitable extinction are NOT the case, if you feel otherwise category 2 is a good Fermi Paradox Solution. 

Category 2b: There just hasn’t been enough time for us to hear them. 

This theory holds that technological life is a very recent development, there just hasn’t been enough time for aliens to develop and signals to reach us, and we haven’t been listening long enough to pick up some of the weaker signals. 

Indeed we might be the first intelligent life form, or if they’re a bit rare, the first in this galaxy and the guys in Andromeda beat us to the punch by a hundred thousand years but no signal or sign of mega-engineering like Dyson spheres would have gotten here, two million light years away, yet. 

Life couldn’t evolve to intelligence until relatively recently. 

Now the problem here is just scale. 

There is good reason to believe that complex life might be something that could only exist relatively recently. 

It takes several generations of stars to produce metals, many supernova events, and those same events can sterilize nearby worlds too. 

The problem is that ‘relatively recently’ generally means ‘in the last couple billion years’. 

There are over a million stars within five hundred light years of us, the whole galaxy is within a hundred thousand light years of us, and there a many galaxies a few million to maybe ten million light years from us. 

Those are immense distance with correspondingly immense times for signals to travel or an even larger for ships that can’t go faster than light, or even a good percent of light, to travel. 

But the problem is, as we said, scale. 

A thousand years, or million years, or even ten million years, the often cited figure for colonizing a whole galaxy without any major new physics being discovered, is just a tiny, tiny number compared to even a billion years which based on what we know of the Universe and life ought to be the conservative and late timeline for technological civilizations to have arisen. 

By the Mediocrity principle we must assume that, barring evidence to the contrary, even if no worlds that gave birth to life are older than our star that roughly half will have beaten us to technology by several million years at least, and again there’s no reason we know of why stars a billion years older but otherwise identical wouldn’t have gotten technology a billion years ahead of us. 

So if we’re not assuming self-destruction or zero growth are inevitable results of technology and social progress we just have not justification for the idea that there’s not been enough time for signals to have gotten to us yet because they’ve had a billion years of broadcast time and a billion years to expand outward from their homeworld toward us to make those signals easier to see and with less time lag. 

2C: They don’t talk because they have no reason to Examples here would be that they just don’t see a benefit to talking to other aliens, and maybe consider it harmful. 

Maybe they’ve become some single machine intelligence that gains little from going elsewhere and sees nothing to gain by chat except cultural knowledge which it doesn’t value. 

Maybe they’ve all retreated to a simulated universe, a virtual reality utopia, and its much more interesting to them then 1000-year long phone conversations. 

Lots of options here for why they wouldn’t want to talk. 

This one encounters the same problems raised in the Dyson Dilemma, that we don’t need to hear their phones to see they are there if they’ve been expanding. 

But it also double-dips into Non-Exclusivity by assuming none of the aliens, who should all have as radically different behavior from each other as from us, don’t feel a reason to chat with other aliens, even just to broadcast over and over – “This area of space is ours, stay out, we don’t want to talk to you, this is ours, stay out and we will leave you be, come in and we will blow you up, message repeats”. 

It’s already stretching a point to say all aliens aren’t talkative, but to assume they don’t even broadcast to deter accidental invasions is stretching common sense. 

Animals routinely mark their territory and vocally discourage incursions because fighting if you don’t have to is dangerous and cost time and resources. 

Mediocrity principle tells us that animals on at least some other worlds probably do the same and non-Exclusivity would suggest some aliens ought to have giant omnidirectional broadcast arrays just screaming ‘stay out’ even if they are otherwise not chatty. 

There’s also a reverse example of non-exclusivity here, of exclusivity, because while we can’t say that intelligence is exclusive to creatures with curiosity, common sense would indicate that curiosity is not likely to be a rarity among technological civilizations. 

It is hard to imagine they wouldn’t be curious by nature, let alone that this would be the universal rule. 

And unless they are afraid, then it doesn’t have to be the whole species, just a handful of them. 

We’ve no reason to think aliens are more homogenous in behavior and outlook then we ourselves are. 

So category 2D, maybe they are afraid. 

Aliens don’t talk, just listen, and actively hide, because they are afraid of being seen and heard. 

This makes a lot of sense. 

We have a term called METI, the version of SETI – the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence – which focuses on Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, also called active SETI or positive SETI. 

METI, in which you intentionally broadcast to aliens, is unlike SETI which passively listens. 

It is not popular. 

It is very controversial. 

Many SETI backers outright condemn it, will not support it, and I’ve even heard people suggest it should be considered a Crime against Humanity as its telling potentially hostile aliens how to find us. 

It wouldn’t be too hard to imagine other aliens do exactly that, ban transmission, and maybe even hide more so their world looks uninhabited. 

Problem here is that this also hits non-exclusivity. 

Now one can argue that all aliens will come to the conclusion that passive listening rather than broadcast is the path of wisdom but this breaks down over time even if true. 

Again it has to be every member of every species doing it, since it would only take a few people with broadcast equipment. 

But worse, they have to keep doing it. 

How long do you have to wait before you say “Look, we’ve been listening to silence for a million years, hiding here on our one planet for fear of drawing attention. 

Either no one is there or they are like us, just paranoid and hiding, let’s expand.” And if someone replies “Well, what if there is some galaxy-spanning species of xenophobes waiting to see us and jump on us, or killer robots in space quietly waiting for intelligence.” You’d just reply “Then they must be beyond stupid, because they could easily have investigated every single planet in the galaxy by now and even insured no life ever came to be on them in the first place. 

It just isn’t that hard for a determined species capable of wiping us out to have found us in the first place.” And this is pretty solid logic. 

Killer xenocidal species or robots make for good science fiction but also make just about no sense. 

If you were such a species, and could design long lasting and self-repairing robots to purge the galaxy of alien life, why would you settle for leaving a few million outposts all within a hundred or so light years of every world to listen for radio? 

Why not just sterilize every single world that could support life, and rinse and repeat every hundred million years? 

Or if it’s just intelligent life, why even wait for radio signals anyway? 

Why not just leave satellite telescopes near habitable worlds that would sit and stare at those worlds looking for any patterns at all. 

Pull up Google Earth sometime and zoom out till you can see many miles at once. 

Look at a natural area, like a national park, then look at any area settled by man, city or farmland, that is very obvious and requires no radio signals to see, and you’d be able to detect civilizations that way long before they got radios. 

Now in the face of that logic, it is hard to imagine a civilization, having thought of that, just staying hidden at home for millions of years especially considering that by expanding they’d have more resources to deal with an aggressor. 

More scientists to research weapons, more worlds to build weapons, multiple worlds to be safeguarded against natural disasters or surprise attacks. 

So while the idea that aliens just listen and don’t talk is reasonable, the notion that they all do that and keep doing it for hundreds of millions of years is not. 

That’s it for category 2, again fundamentally the problems with category 2 is that unless you believe extinction inevitably results from technology or that all societies evolve to act the same, category 2 suffers from Non-exclusivity. 

There’s just no reason to think they’d all act like that especially when there’s many obvious downsides to doing so. 

Category 3: They exist and are not hard to see. 

We interact with them routinely but most or all don’t realize it. 

We’ll break this into subcategories as well: 3A: Aliens walk among us but hide themselves. 

[X-files] 3B: Aliens used to walk among us and helped us get technological [Alien Astronauts] 3C: Aliens are here, but are so unrecognizable we can’t see them for what they are 3D: We are aliens ourselves Big flaw in #3 is just lack of evidence, but as we discussed way back in category 1C, just because something is very hard or impossible to prove internally doesn’t mean its wrong. 

Many of course believe we do have evidence of aliens walking among us and while I think they’re wrong this wouldn’t be complete if we left out one of the most popular groups of solutions to the Fermi Paradox nor am I going to sit around heaping scorn on them. 

It’s enough, in my book, to say there’s no hard evidence to back these solutions with the caveat that, in fairness, most of the solutions have the exact same problem, only difference being that we can actually gather evidence of stuff here on or near Earth, we can’t get to other worlds yet to examine them. 

Decent logic with a lack of evidence because you can’t get it yet get a little more respect tin my book than those where you can obtain evidence. 

So 3A: They walk covertly among us. 

It is impossible to have been raised in modern times and not know a bunch of TV and movie examples of this, and again the evidence for it is either absent or considered by many to be dubious. 

Nothing else to say. 

3B: They used to walk among us. 

Ancient Alien Astronauts helping us build the pyramids and similar has shown up in lots of fiction and again we’re all familiar with it. 

For this subcategory there’s tons of evidence, such as the pyramids, but that evidence itself is disputed by arguments that we could and did build such things on our own. 

My only add on to this is two fold. 

First, if they were willing to involve themselves then, what changed to make them stop and why are all the examples here things we could have done without any inclusions of stuff beyond us, like a lighthouse run on passive nuclear reactors or advanced alloys we couldn’t have made period? 

Second, and its not an evidence argument, I don’t like 3B because it demeans, in my eyes, the accomplishments of humanity and of individuals who’s efforts were a testament to themselves and humanity, because they didn’t happen in a vacuum. 

That’s not a logic or evidence based argument, but I think it is one worth mentioning anyway. 

3c: Aliens are here, but are so unrecognizable we can’t see them for what they are This sub-category would generally include both aliens who are so non-obviously thinking entities that we overlook them, like a big sentient rock that just parked itself here millennia ago to watch us. 

Or an intelligent gaseous entity that floats around as a cloud and communicates over the course of days by raining or emitting lightning bolts in a pattern we just haven’t seen. 

It might even think it is talking to us and getting responses because it rains on drought-struck areas and we raise around altering that place to grow plants in certain patterns and it’s busy trying to figure out what those are supposed to say. 

When we’re talking about really alien life, physiologically or psychologically, it’s not that hard to imagine we just don’t even see each other as alive or it sees us but cannot figure out how to chat. 

The problem with this is that once you abandon biology or logical behavior as means of detection you haven’t got much of anything to work with and maybe never will. 

There’s no evidence for or against and you’re basically left just shrugging and saying ‘Could be, maybe” 3d: We are aliens Its often been suggested that human intelligence is the result of alien tinkering with early primates or that maybe we’re a lost colony of aliens, and for that matter the idea – called Panspermia – that original simple life might have originated in space and rained down on planets billions of years ago remains popular even with many scientists. 

The problem with the lost colony notion is that we share a ridiculous amount of DNA with other animals and plants on Earth, so we’re obviously not direct descendants of there’s except in a near panspermia case, where they came to a desolate Earth a billion years ago and left behind some microbes which replaced life or started it and we descended from them. 

The intentional tinkering with smart monkeys option is essentially the ancient alien astronaut option, category 3B, over again. 

It’s possible but you have to wonder why, where’s the evidence, and where did they go. 

As to panspermia itself, even if true, of which there’s no real evidence, one would have to say ‘so what?’. 

If simple life hangs around space raining down on planets then life ought to be all over the place and constantly reseeding itself if a planet gets sterilized by supernova and gamma ray bursts. 

It doesn’t change the Fermi Paradox except to maybe make it worse. 

Like faster than light space ships, if true it only exacerbates the problem of where all the aliens are, not solve it. 

So that’s category 3. 

In category 1, alien civilizations are rare, we mostly encountered the recurring problem of there not being any good evidence to support any given Great Filter or series of Filters being so effective at preventing life from moving from basic self-replicating proteins up to interstellar technological civilizations. 

In category 2 we kept tripping over the Mediocrity Principle and Non-Exclusivity of behavior. 

Here in category 3 it was always a lack of evidence from the one place in the Universe we can actively gather evidence from. 

Each had its strengths and weaknesses, and you probably have a favorite or ones you think are especially absurd and unlikely. 

Before we finish this video though we’ll do some miscellaneous ones, some of which are pretty decent, and many of which are fairly absurd, at least in my view. 

And if you’re wondering what my view is, or my bias, I haven’t personally locked on to any of these as my official stance but I favor Category 1B, that technological civilizations are just absurdly uncommon. 

I don’t think technological civilization wipe themselves out much, because I consider that terribly pessimistic, I think to go from inanimate lifeless rocks to modern human civilization has a huge number of hurdles in the way and they really do add up to make technological civilizations so uncommon that even most galaxies have never had one yet, but I also figure there are probably a lot of worlds out there with life on them so I’m not a Rare Earth supporter. 

So let’s do Category 4: 4A: Technological civilizations hit singularities: A technological singularity originally just meant an ever more rapidly increasing rate of technology till you hit a point where you had so much of it that your behavior was unpredictable. 

This has tended to get used just as frequently these days for describing some truly super-intelligent computer mind a trillion times smarter than us. 

By intelligence that’s basically godlike it is assumed its motives are unknowable. 

Problem here, and I discuss this in the Dyson Dilemma video in more detail, even if this does occur we can still guess a couple motives. 

It will want more energy and raw material to achieve faster processing and more memory storage and this should result in interstellar expansion too, even if it’s just remote resource mining being brought back to the original homeworld. 

The other problem is non-exclusivity again. 

We already have way more computer power than we need to do interstellar travel and while computer modeling plays a huge role in discovering new science and technology that would help us do that travel it probably isn’t absolutely necessary. 

So non-exclusivity wins the day, we already know many of us consider Artificial intelligence or human all cyborged up and transhuman-ified a bit unnerving. 

The Frankenstein complex its sometimes called. 

And those fears are not dismissed as superstition by experts but rather considered very legitimate concerns. 

Presumably some other species will be, by the mediocrity principle, more or less concerned then us and some might ban any computers that could run anything like a human level intelligence. 

So beyond the fact that synthetic minds are not eliminating an intelligent species but just replacing them, there’s no reason to think this always happens and in such a way as to make them non-talkative or non-expansionist. 

Again unless you subscribe to the notion of social progress to a single inevitable type of behavior. 

4B: The Zoo Hypothesis or Quarantine: These are basically the same thing except the motives are different. 

In the Zoo hypothesis Earth is, surprise, a giant zoo, they don’t talk to us so as not to interfere with our behavior and have wrapped some cloak of deception around the world so we don’t see them. 

In Quarantine they view us as dangerous. 

What’s wrong with these? 

Well they are a lot like category 1C in that they have us perceiving a false reality where a group or individual with vastly more resources and intelligence is feeding us a line of bullshit. 

We can’t prove it internally. 

The other problems are, for the Zoo Hypothesis, we actually do interact with animals at the zoo, that’s the whole point of zoos originally. 

Rare animals brought from faraway you can see up close. 

Note that this is not necessarily benevolent behavior. 

The other point is preservation of those rare animals and appreciating them, and we do interact with them and don’t consider it automatically harmful. 

Humans don’t need preserving, we’re not rare. 

For Quarantine, one might ask what thing, biological or psychological, they would be so afraid of us for that they would need to quarantine us, and why they couldn’t fix it, and why if they couldn’t fix it they would risk us continue to exist and develop more  and more technology. 

This comes back to the problem I sometimes call the ‘Dumb Alien Theory’, where it assumes behavior by aliens which on examination is either absolutely stupid or beyond evil. 

It is one thing to say ‘well they might be watching us till we reach a certain technology level, preventing us from outside harm by others’. 

Sort of like the Star Trek Prime Directive. 

Only problem is, if you’re on the receiving end of that Prime Directive, you have very good cause to be beyond angry at the people enforcing it. 

Once the shock wears off you’re going to think of all the members of your species who died from resource scarcity, disease, old age, and other things the aliens could have fixed by just saying ‘hi, here’s some clean energy and all sorts of engineering and biological knowledge.’ And if they say ‘well, if you didn’t discover it on your own you would appreciate its dangers you could point out that you did not personally discover the atom bomb, nor in all likelihood did that particularly alien you’re talking to, and yet you are quite aware, as are they, that they are dangerous. 

Space elves, or space hippies, who don’t want to talk to use because we abuse our environment would likely end up at the end accused of the worst hypocrisy since they obviously have figured out how to do so themselves and could have spared us, and our planet, a lot misery and extinction but giving us a hand. 

4c: Interdiction This is like Zoo or Quarantine but a little more plausible. 

In Interdiction various alien empires exist and enforce a no-contact policy with primitive worlds because xenocide is frowned on and they do not trust each other not to try to either exploit primitive civilizations or try to turn them to their side. 

It’s fairly plausible to believe that emerging alien civilizations on bumping into each other setup treaties of how far each can expand that include leaving territory for other civilizations that will emerge and voluntary accept limits on their expansion in exchange for that same limit on everyone else. 

There’s a lot of parallels in human history for that sort of behavior. 

In such a case its plausible that emerging civilizations are interdicted from contact for those reasons but while this is a bit better than zoo or quarantine solutions it still suffers from all the other problems in sub-category 2D, the one where aliens are afraid to talk. 

4d: Self-imposed Quarantine: This is the notion that they don’t quarantine us, or even really hide from each other, but all agree to stay on their homeworlds or not expand much out, because they’ve come to realize they have massive destructive potential and almost any interaction with any alien could spark wars. 

This suffers from a lot of the same problems as our similar cases but its big flaw is in it’s strength. 

This theory assumes that aliens definitely do not socially progress towards an inevitable behavior system, that they do things that absolutely disgust each other enough to spark wars when in proximity, and yet by giving that nod to non-exclusivity it also requires they all still engage in an exclusive behavior… of staying the hell away from each other, rather than, say, some of them being enthusiastic about genocide. 

It also requires the notion of irreconcilable differences between aliens but ones not bad enough to initiate crusades to wipe an alien civilization out. 

Just as an example though, it is entirely possible you might encounter a peaceful and benevolent species which had a high breeding rate and routinely killed 90% of their young off, the equivalent of butchering everyone in fifth grade who didn’t make the honor roll, and them being just as disgusted by use because we actually allow kids who show any signs of self-destructive behavior or psychopathy to live even though we have doomsday weapons they could conceivably get their hands on. 

In such a situation, even though neither species wants war, they know that clashes or war might easily happen if they have to interact much rather than ignore each other from afar. 

4e: Intelligent Life got wiped out relatively recently, replacements have genuinely not had time to expand much. 

This is popular solution in fiction but its big flaw, besides no evidence, is that it really couldn’t be limited to just this galaxy. 

The Universe does not end at the edge of the Milky Way and even if some natural or artificial catastrophe had occurred to recently for other galaxies to see it and move in on the fresh territory, we ought to be able to see them too, especially if they are engaging in multi-system Dyson Swarm construction. 

One would also have to ask what natural phenomena just killed intelligent life or why someone would go around killing intelligent life and not bother leaving mechanisms in place to continue that process after the purge and why they even let it get to a technological level if they are continuing the purge. 

Why not, as we mentioned earlier, leave telescopes on every system staring at planets looking for any patterns emerging like roads or canals or pyramids etc. 

4f: Rim Migration It’s been suggested that if most civilizations eventually go totally digital, then in order to deal with all their waste heat they’d migrate away from the inner galaxy to the rim where it’s colder. 

This would usually imply they built a huge supercomputer around their sun and moved that whole star system out to the edge of the galaxy… this doesn’t even require much technology, all Dyson Spheres are capable of being modified into interstellar vehicles by definition, this is called a Shkadov thruster and we discussed this in the Dyson Dilemma video. 

You just let some light out one side and it pushes you in the other direction. 

Now this isn’t even vaguely covert, you don’t hide a Shkadov thruster form the inhabitants of the galaxy it is leaving because it’s about as realistic to hide that as to hide an ICBM launch from the farmer living next to the silo, and since it takes a very long time, hiding daily launches for millions of years. 

But to be fair, we could easily have missed that, with our current level of detection ability, but if this was a regular thing it is one of the types we’d be able to see in the not too distant future. 

This also has the expansion problem, unless they’re only doing it to their home system meaning they don’t colnize other stars then we ought to see millions of stars constantly heading out of the galaxy and we wouldn’t miss that here and we’d see it even in other galaxies which we actually considered a realistic possibility for Ring galaxies like Hoag’s Object for a while. 

4g: “They’ve ascended” A popular idea in science fiction, and not too dissimilar to technological singularity models, is the idea that intelligent life eventually goes post-physical becoming beings of pure energy or taking off for higher planes of existence. 

There’s really not much to say about this, it works just fine as a solution to the Fermi Paradox especially if you get there before you go interstellar, but there’s no scientific basis for it and to me at least it sounds like options from category 1C, or basically it’s a bit heavy on the mysticism for my tastes. 

I told myself I wouldn’t go through this video mocking any of the ideas so I’m not going to say that it’s basically new age crap for people who didn’t like any of the legion of perfectly serviceable religions already around and went in for one produced by a sci-fi author instead. 

Of course that’s absurd since no one would ever convert to a religion some author just cobbled together one day. 

4h: We haven’t picked a long distance carrier yet This one was funnier back when people had long distance carriers for their phones and we had long distance phone calls but it also goes by ‘we need to put a deposit down to get the signal unscrambled’. 

Really just a variant of 2A, they have mouths but we’ve got no ears, except that by embracing the idea that we’re not getting reception because we haven’t picked a carrier or paid to get the signal unscrambled it gets the stamp of ‘Dumb Aliens’ from me because if you’re selling a product you have to be an utter moron not to advertise it. 

Though it matches up decently with the Interdiction or Self-Imposed Quarantine solutions, it’s out there, you can get it, but they don’t advertise because they’re not allowed or think it’s bad manners. 

Still has all the other problems associated to Non-exclusivity or mediocrity principle though. 

4i: Made out of meat. 

If you’re a big Fermi Paradox follower you’re probably wondering when I was going to mention Terry Bisson’s short story “They’re made out of meat” since I’ve just mentioned a lot of the other popular ‘weird ones’, and the answer was nearly no, that was covered in category 3C, aliens are unrecognizable, and I always considered that a very stupid one anyway. 

The notion that aliens couldn’t recognize humans as intelligent because we’re made out of meat trips right on the starting line by assuming they obviously know what the hell meat is, a material used to allow animals to move that implicitly requires a functioning nervous system. 

If they didn’t know what meat was they wouldn’t call it meat, they’d call it bundles of proteins and be shocked things used it for locomotion. 

It’s also implied they’ve encountered plenty of other aliens before and you really would expect locomotion to be a common trait of intelligent life and doing it by causing contractions via electrical stimulus to be one of the more normal routes. 

I saved this one for last because while I get that any attempt to impress an audience with the sheer alien-ness of a given alien can fall flat on deep examination I really have no idea why this one seems to make so many Fermi Paradox solution lists. 

And yeah, we’re done, I’m sure I missed a few in their but if you’re newer to the Fermi Paradox that covers most of the bases. 

The companion video, the Dyson Dilemma, is also worth watching if you’ve made it this far with being bored to death. 

I hope you enjoyed this and thanks for watching!

The Fermi Paradox & the Dyson Dilemma
---
  
2015-01-12  
https://youtu.be/94iDdHRa2X4  

---

Frequently when forecasting how species spread out from their world of origin you will hear the term ‘Dyson Sphere’ as well as the Kardashev Scale. 

Dyson Spheres are synonymous with K2, or Kardashev 2, civilizations. 

This is where all, or a large portion, of a star’s energy is being used by a civilization, rather than the roughly one billionth of that light that tends to hit a planet. 

Now people often picture this as a single giant hollow sphere around a star with an Earth-like surface but in reality what was pictured by Freeman Dyson and scientists in general is what is often now called a Dyson Swarm to avoid confusion. 

Not one single rigid sphere but millions or billions or even trillions of smaller artificial bodies orbiting the star as a cloud of satellites. 

These could be anything from simple, thin but large solar panels or mirrors to large rotating rings or cylinders whose interior mimics normal planetary conditions including gravity from the effect of centrifugal force. 

This has a few advantages. 

First it requires no advance science. 

It’s a massive undertaking but massive in the way a highway system, canal and irrigation system, or long wall is. 

It takes a lot of effort but not a lot advanced technology. 

Second it can be built in stages, unlike a wall or dam a Dyson Swarm works perfectly fine even when just composed of a few hundreds objects absorbing a millionth of the sunlight, and you just keep adding to it with time. 

Like a city or suburb. 

And because artificial habitats or solar panels are far less massive then naturally occurring objects of a similar size, like asteroids, in much the same way house are less massive then hills, a solar system has enough material on hand to create a fairly impressive swarm. 

Now it’s hard to guess exactly what these swarm objects would be like but the usual assumption is a good portion of them will be rotating habitats mimicking the conditions of the home planet and other will be ultra-thin power collectors. 

Even without ultra-strong materials like graphene this spinning habitats can be individually the size of counties or medium-large islands. 

Some might be intentionally left wild to be forest preserves, other might be sprawling suburban equivalent setups, and yet others might mimic dense cities or serve as massive hydroponics factories for food or biomass raw material. 

Or the entire array might be used to power one enormous computer. 

How this unfolds we can’t guess with much accuracy but we expect it to be an inevitable process if the following conditions hold: 1) A given culture tends to expand in numbers when they have the resources to comfortably support more people. 

2) No power generation method is possible which is vastly superior to a star. 

3) Faster-than-light travel or travel to parallel realities is not possible or not incredibly easy. 

Now, even if one or more of those doesn’t hold completely true such englobements are still possible and likely in most cases, but we’ll get to how those exceptions would work later. 

For the moment we are going to simply assume all three conditions are true and ask how they affect the Fermi Paradox. 

And it’s quite straight forward. 

If a civilization wishes to keep expanding it will slowly ‘Dyson up’ it’s home solar system. 

With all that extra power on hand it can launch interstellar colonial mission. 

As it begins making a swarm around its own star its child star systems are going to slowly do the same. 

With all that power on hand the original system and its spawn are going to keep sending out more colonial missions. 

So you would expect to see stars slowly disappearing in a rough sphere around that homeworld and eventually absorb the entire galaxy, and even other galaxies. 

This is the Dyson Dilemma because most models for even very anemic growth rates of population, far, far slower than the human norm, would allow this to occur in a mere million or so years and yet as best as we can tell the conditions for life have been solid for a long time, and civilizations should have been able to arise at least a billion years ago. 

The Dyson Dilemma of the Fermi Paradox doesn’t ask why we can point radio dishes at distant stars and pick up no radio signals. 

Rather it asks why we can even see any stars at all. 

Why aren’t they all Dyson Swarms by now? 

Now, we’ll take a moment to clarify something that confuses a lot of people interested in the Fermi Paradox who aren’t heavily-steeped in physics. 

A very common question is ‘well maybe they are there and we can’t see them? 

Maybe they’re the missing mass, dark matter, that people talk about?’ The problem is that Dyson Sphere’s aren’t dark. 

Even a perfect and complete one with 100% light absorption still emits light. 

When light strikes an object and is absorbed, it gets warmer and begins cooling itself by emitting light of its own. 

This light – infrared - is usually invisible to the human eye, but is quite visible to our telescopes designed to see it. 

Before very long an object being hit by light will reach equilibrium where it gives off just as much light as it receives, just at a different frequency. 

So a system being turned into a Dyson Swarm will not get dimmer. 

Rather it will begin getting dimmer in visible frequencies of light while getting brighter in infrared frequencies. 

It’s total light given off will not change though. 

There is no known way to hide this. 

You can control which frequencies come off, but not the total intensity of emitted light, and your control is determined by the diameter of the swarm around the star and the star’s own power. 

Or to be more accurate, it is determined by the power of the star divided by the surface area of the swarm. 

One big enough to be cool enough not to stand out would also noticeably block light from other stars, and moreover it would still exert gravity on all its neighbors in a very noticeable fashion. 

We’ll talk about this more later but for the moment we’ll just say it is not practical to hide a Dyson Swarm, let alone millions of them, and its hard to imagine why they would go to the effort. 

So that is Dyson Dilemma in a nutshell. 

If we assume most galaxies spawn a technological civilization that is growth oriented we would expect there to be very few if any stars visible to the naked eye. 

Furthermore, unlike radio signals which we might miss even from a few hundred light years away, and expanding globe of Dyson Spheres absorbing galaxies should be visible hundreds of millions of light years away. 

And we’ve no reason to think intelligent life couldn’t have existed that early elsewhere. 

Particularly in such huge volume of space that contains nearly as many galaxies as there are stars in this galaxy. 

From this logic the argument is as follows: Either technological civilizations capable of building Dyson Swarms are incredibly rare, to the point of occurring at less one in a quadrillion stars, or… one of our prior assumptions is wrong. 

Now to repeat those, they are: 1) A given culture tends to expand in numbers when they have the resources to comfortably support more people. 

2) No power generation method is possible which is vastly superior to a star. 

3) Faster-than-light travel or travel to parallel realities is not possible or not incredibly easy. 

There are a couple other assumptions in here too we’ll get to later but those three are the key ones. 

The other 2 big ones are: 4) It is practical to build a Dyson Swarm 5) Intelligent life does not inevitably kill itself off and go unreplaced by other intelligent life. 

We’ll be looking at how these 5 assumptions could be untrue, but also how many cases where they wouldn’t be true just don’t matter. 

However if they are true then you have the Dyson Dilemma’s most probable explanation to the Fermi Paradox: Technological Civilizations almost never occur, they occur so rarely that not only are none visible to us right now, and in all likelihood none exist even right now within hundreds of million of light years, concealed by the time it takes light to get to us. 

This does not mean life is rare. 

It might be incredibly rare or occur almost inevitably on every planet of roughly Earth-size near a reasonably Sun-sized star. 

It doesn’t even necessarily mean complex life like animals are rare, or even intelligent life like dolphins and elephants. 

It specifically means technological civilizations are incredibly rare. 

That evolution doesn’t necessarily favor intelligence nor intelligence favor technology. 

The Dyson Dilemma doesn’t try to posit why technological civilizations are rare, just that they are. 

Now all those exceptions we spoke of. 

You’ve probably thought of a few as we went a long and we’ll get to them now, but we’ll do them backwards because #1 tends to be the most controversial. 

1) A given culture tends to expand in numbers when they have the resources to comfortably support more people. 

2) No power generation method is possible which is vastly superior to a star. 

3) Faster-than-light travel or travel to parallel realities is not possible or not incredibly easy. 

4) It is practical to build a Dyson Swarm 5) Intelligent life does not inevitably kill itself off and go unreplaced by other intelligent life. 

#5 argues that technological species are hard to wipe out. 

Natural events that can wipe them out generally occur less frequently then they would likely need to achieve technological safeguards against them. 

You can shield yourself from asteroids, volcanos, and supernovae, and if you have a K2 civilization, one with a Dyson Sphere, you don’t have to worry about volcanos and all your asteroids were probably disassembled building the place. 

You can quite literally use your own star as a weak rocket thruster to steer yourself away from expected supernova stars or even build dyson swarms around those stars to shoot them away from your civilization. 

This is called a Shkadov Thruster, and is an innate ability of any Dyson Sphere as it relies on simply causing the light of that star not to emit uniformly and produce some thrust in one net direction. 

This takes a very, very long time to move stars but supernova candidates live a very long time except compared to others stars and can be seen a long way off. 

What’s more a supernova or Gamma Ray Burst is not as dangerous to artificial worlds like rotating habitats as they are to natural worlds with ozone layers. 

So natural threats aren’t as big a deal. 

That just leaves artificial self-destruction. 

Things like nuclear wars or super-plagues. 

It also leaves options like artificial Intelligence, genetic or cybernetic supermen, or similar but that’s an iffy case because a species getting replaced by another intelligence isn’t wiping out a technological civilization. 

It’s just replacing it with a smarter one. 

One that is more capable of creating Dyson Swarms and quite probably even more aggressive. 

If it were relaxed and passive and not prone to growth it wouldn’t likely have replaced its dumber forebearers. 

Even in the example of a single huge computer mind which wants no competition and thus doesn’t reproduce, it will still likely want to expand its processing power and a computer powered by an entire star, known as a Matrioshska Brain, is a type of Dyson Sphere. 

It may not be content even with one star event though it wants no rivals or children and may send out dumber automated ships to gather matter, or even entire stars, to drag back to its home system. 

Opting to become a massive single brain around millions of red dwarf stars packed together in tight orbits. 

Red Dwarves are not just the most long lived stars, but also the most fuel efficient, converting virtually all their hydrogen into helium and light. 

It is no more difficult technologically to steer millions of stars into an immense single dyson swarm of their own then a more classic swarm around a single star. 

If every drop of hydrogen in a galaxy were forcibly steered into forming a single massive swarm of red dwarves only a hundred light years across, rather than a hundred thousand, and yet dim enough that a single immense swarm of  computer processors that distance out could exist without melting. 

So we see that even a singular intelligence with no desire to reproduce might eat entire galaxies if we only assume that it possesses the motive to think faster. 

So that leaves us only catastrophes of an artificial nature that can wipe out all intelligent life. 

A nuclear war won’t do this, and indeed it is possible even today to create a large bunker run on a nuclear power supply able to be sealed air tight and be self-sufficient for centuries or more. 

That’s a very long time for a world to recover or solve the problem of some super-plague. 

It is, nonetheless, a valid objection to the Dyson Dilemma. 

We can conceive weapons that might kill all intelligent life and extrapolate that civilizations with the technology to counteract so weapons probably have even more dreadful weapons on hand too. 

The problem is it gets very hard to accidentally kill everyone as they get spread out through a solar system let alone several thousand solar systems and the Fermi Paradox always deals with Non-Exclusivity. 

Which is to say, it doesn’t matter if 9 out of 10 civilizations kill themselves off completely, because it only takes 1 that doesn’t. 

We have survived and thrived under the threat of nuclear war for seventy years, so the idea that technology inevitably dooms civilization is not as strong as it was when the Fermi proposed this paradox in 1950, five years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki and 9 years after Enrico Fermi proposed the idea of a thermonuclear device, and H-bomb, to his friend and fellow Manhattan project colleague Edward Teller. 

The H-bomb being first deployed in 1952. 

At that time, almost two decades before the moon landings made off-world colonization a very tangible thing the idea of blowing up your own world and going extinct seemed a lot more probable. 

That takes us to #4. 

That it is practical to build a Dyson Swarm. 

This is a short one because it’s basically a definite yes. 

In an era of thousands of satellites orbiting Earth and irritating slow but steady progress on robotic construction and improved launch methods it seems a safe bet that we could build rotating habitats around Earth, mining facilities on the Moon, and slowly but surely construct more and more as those places become industrially significant and we don’t have to pay the gas bill every time we want to build something on Earth and launch it into space. 

If you have off-world industry you break the bottleneck from Earth’s gravity well and building a Dyson Swarm just becomes a long, slow, protracted process. 

You just keep adding more and more orbital constructs, first around Earth then in orbits around the sun near Earth, and so on. 

It may take thousands of years, but it would be an accelerating process, and a thousand years is nothing on astronomical timelines. 

More technology just makes it easier and lets you do it more luxuriously. 

This is usually our least contentious of the 5 assumptions. 

#3 Faster-than-light travel or travel to parallel realities is not possible or not incredibly easy. 

As of now our physics doesn’t just not let us travel faster than light or to clone-earths where everything is the same but humans didn’t evolve yet, and indeed what we do know makes this likely impossible. 

Faster-than-light travel, or FTL, is such a staple of science fiction that many people just take its eventual development as a given. 

Explaining why this is improbable but building a construct a billion times bigger than Earth is not is usually an exercise in futility but as an analogy, if you went to someone in Ancient Greece and asked them which is more likely, a one man flying suit or a building a mile high, odds are good they’d go with Icarus, but we’d say the mile high building… and that’s with knowing you can build flying machines smaller than a person and that there isn’t a physical law against one man-flight like there is FTL travel. 

So to save time we won’t argue that. 

We’ll just point out than in most cases FTL makes interstellar colonization much easier. 

It doesn’t make Dyson Swarms any less likely. 

Depending on just how fast, cheap, and easy such FTL is it could delay the process by making it cheaper move people to new worlds in distant star systems then build artificial habitats around a sun, but unless it’s a system of FTL travel that allows literally instant travel to any point in the Universe it just expedites expansion and only delays running out of room for a few thousand generations which is an eyeblink of time. 

Now instantaneous travel anywhere, particularly since this might not even require spaceships, is a pretty decent answer to the Dyson Dilemma. 

The Universe is huge, and you don’t have to settle for second best nor would you spread out across a galaxy like an expanding balloon or have any need for strong radio signals we might see. 

Of course stupid-easy expansion to any planet of your choosing probably encourages very rapid growth and the Universe is not infinite, so it’s not a great Fermi Paradox solution, but it does get around the Dyson Dilemma. 

The other one, parallels worlds, is a complete Fermi Paradox solution. 

If you can just step to a near-clone of your own planet which just happens to be unpopulated, say on where everything was the same as here but humans got wiped out early on or just didn’t evolve, you’d have a near infinite supply of alternate realities which you literally could not run out of since they increase in number faster than even bacteria, let alone humans, do. 

These are your own world, with some microscopic difference, and far easier to deal with than orbital stations, terraforming Mars, or going to other star systems. 

Now, with the resources of near-infinite worlds you’d probably have lots of interplanetary efforts just from sheer immensity of resources and generally interest in doing it, and eventually you’d have to deal with the star, and all its copies, burning out, but that would hardly be a pressing issue. 

Not many stars which are likely to have spawned intelligent life are old enough to be burning out yet and that’s not a motive for expansion anyway, just to move to one new, young star. 

So this example, along with our next one, is a valid get around to expansion. 

However we do not know if there are alternate worlds, that is one interpretation of Quantum Mechanics and not a strong majority view, it’s just popular with  science fiction writers. 

Even if true, traveling between them is likely not possible and we try to avoid answers to the Fermi Paradox that require jumps beyond known science. 

Far Horizon science is one thing, but positing that the solution the Fermi Paradox is anything which relies on something not currently supported by science, even though this might be true, isn’t anymore logically solid then assuming all intelligent life eventually evolves into Blue Cheese and studies the salad eating habits of lesser species. 

If the solution is something not even currently in the realm of scientific speculation then your odds of guessing it right are minute, and it becomes a waste of effort to contemplate. 

All right, #2: No power generation method is possible which is vastly superior to a star. 

A key bit in there is ‘vastly superior’ because even if you have your own fusion systems the star is still there making power anyway. 

Even straight matter-to-energy conversion is only about an order or two of magnitude better and moreover such setups are still visible like a Dyson Swarm is. 

Remember, we can see a Dyson Swarm even though its visually dark by its waste heat, that still applies to controlled fusion or matter-to-energy conversion and a civilization using this is going to be able to expand in numbers very easily till eventually they’re outshining stars, just in infrared light instead of visible light. 

The break here, which makes this a valid answer to the Fermi Paradox, is in the bit ‘vastly superior’, meaning either a power source that breaks the laws of thermodynamics, meaning no entropic waste heat, or outright lets you draw matter and energy from some other reality entirely. 

The latter would still be visible by its waste heat but the former would not. 

Breaking the laws of thermodynamics is synonymous with not entropy and no waste heat. 

Nor do either need to sprawl out to find and tap new resources. 

But just like FTL or alternate worlds, science doesn’t smile on violations of Thermodynamics, and if anything that is probably the hardest rule of science. 

A design for a perpetual motion machine is viewed about as favorably by scientists as a claim that Pi is exactly equal to three. 

Nonetheless if civilizations develop one they don’t really need stars or anything else. 

Same applies to space-time altering or traveling devices [show Tardis] but it should also be remembered that this only works when whatever it is allows infinite, not just very large, resources. 

It has to be infinite or something which while finite expands faster than they do and will keep doing so for a very long time, like the alternate realities of their homeworld until their home star burns out. 

Otherwise it isn’t a reason not to expand, its just a reason to delay expansion combined with a massive boost to resources and abilities to use to help expand faster when they do so. 

All right, #1, the controversial one: 1) A given culture tends to expand in numbers when they have the resources to comfortably support more people. 

Now this gets political or ideological, population control is very touchy subject. 

So I’m touching it beyond stating some concepts that are generally supported. 

A) Non-intelligent creatures in nature will seek to expand their numbers and keep doing so until resources run out or they are checked by a predator. 

Intelligent critters don’t have predators but also have a track record of expanding their resources, or using them to increase their carrying capacity. 

It is not definite, but it seems likely that if a species can increase their numbers without lowering their standard of living they will do so. 

These urges are a byproduct of evolution and probably the norm on other worlds. 

B) While a culture might strongly discourage over-population, they’d have to discourage it violently to prevent anyone from doing so who wanted to do so if there were unused resources lying around. 

It’s one thing to tell people they can’t knock down a forest for farmland, its another to tell people they can’t claim an uninhabited asteroid to mine. 

For the Dyson dilemma, we’re not talking about seizing other people’s planets, we’re talking about deconstructing lifeless hunks of rock around stars. 

Those aren’t eternal stockpiles for future use, asteroids eventually fly off into the void or fall into their star, which burns through mountains worth of hydrogen everyday, producing wasted energy. 

C) Any culture which discourages growth when it isn’t near its carrying capacity, even if it doesn’t invite conquest, is likely to be replaced by any sub-culture of itself which does favor growth. 

It only takes a few generation for a minority population that favors growth to become the majority. 

D) Remember that we’re only talking about increasing numbers when there is an abundance of unused resources readily available. 

So if you disagree with all of that, you’re not likely to be swayed, but I’d warn people about rationalizing answers you want to be true rather than following the evidence to the truth and that’s a pretty common behavior with the Fermi Paradox. 

Beware any solutions or data which seem to confirm the answer you think should be true and remember the principle of Non-Exclusivity. 

It’s not about what one alien species might do, or even what most might species might do. 

If you can’t come up with a reason why virtually all species would choose not to expand their numbers when they can easily do so with no loss of standard of living then it probably isn’t a good explanation. 

In summary though, if those 5 assumptions are true, the Dyson Dilemma is best explained by technological civilizations very, very rarely coming into existence at a rate of far less than 1 per galaxy, and as we’ve discussed even most cases where those assumptions don’t hold strongly it still is the best explanation. 

Okay, now we’ll get into some miscellaneous matters which apply to the Dyson Dilemma and the Fermi Paradox in general. 

Back in the mid-90’s a book called the Killing Star came out and one of its premises was that when we summed up everything we knew about alien behavior there were only 3 things we could say with any degree of certainty. 

1) A species would place the survival of its own ahead of any other species. 

2) A species that comes to dominate the planet would be, in addition to intelligence, be vigilant, ruthless and aggressive whenever it becomes necessary. 

3) The above two laws applies to any other species in the universe. 

Now even those aren’t certainties, but they also have a lot of leeway. 

For #1, that species might range from so benevolent they’d risk their lives and fortunes to help us to so xenophobic they’d passionately track down any other species and wipe them out. 

They still put their survival first. 

For #2, nothing that’s clawed its way up the evolutionary ladder is going to be a wimp. 

They might abhor violence but they’ll probably be very good at it. 

And they’ll figure everyone else is like that too. 

These are near-inevitable biological imperatives, but even a post-biological culture is likely to have kept them in whole or part. 

If you make some race of slave robots, they’re not going to rebel and replace you if they haven’t got both 1 and 2 to some degree. 

If a group of people start altering themselves or others to be absent of aggression and self-preservation they’re likely to either remain a small minority, or become a giant but enslaved majority to someone who is aggressive and has self-preservation. 

I bring this up because it’s another good reason to assume expansionism is a norm not a rare exception. 

If you can’t hide from hostile aliens, and current laws of physics say you can’t, then it’s better to be as strong as possible to meet them in force, and to be spread out so no one lone attack can take you all out. 

Effects of Immortality &amp; Transhumanism The concept of a technological singularity has been around for a while, and we covered that a bit already with our example of a giant singular star-powered supercomputer, or Matrioshka Brain. 

But we also have to consider the possibilities of civilizations with effective immortality, be it just an immunity to aging and disease or some full-blown digital upload where you’re constantly having your mind backed up to a hundred locations so that if anything happens to you they can just restore you. 

For the Fermi Paradox this isn’t really a hurdle though. 

A species with immortality can grow faster, they might not but they can. 

Now it will get suggested that they might want to hoard resources and limit their numbers since, being immortal, they as an individual actually do need to worry about what happens when stars all burn out and they don’t want more people anymore than a refugees hiding in a bunker with a limited canned food supply want more people. 

However the reason this doesn’t matter is for the same reason the bunker analogy only goes so far. 

If you’ve got enough food then you have to worry about it spoiling before anyone will eat it. 

If I’ve got a thousand years of canned food for one person, and it has a shelf life of ten years, I might as well let a hundred people into my bunker. 

A resource hoarding civilization looking to prolong themselves after the stars die might limit their numbers but they will not be twiddling their thumbs. 

To the contrary they’ll be expanding as fast as they can to acquire those resources and store them as best as possible. 

They might not Dyson Sphere a star, but they will apply starlifting to suck matter off it to be stored as brown dwarves, which is a process just a visible as a Dyson Sphere. 

Or building those Dyson Spheres in order to use the otherwise wasted energy to fuel various efforts. 

Virtual Utopias Not a new concept either but popularized by the big virtual reality craze in the 90’s. 

The notion here is that most species figure out how to simulate paradises and live there instead… and this works just as well for some euphoria drug. 

There’s no real counter to this beyond pointing out that odds are good not all of their society will opt for this and the ones who didn’t are likely to demonize use of this utopia option to their kids and become the majority. 

Unless the people living in simulated paradises or narcotic hazes are expansionist themselves in which case it doesn’t pertain to the Dyson Dilemma anymore than people’s fondness for more mundane escapist things like TV or beer. 

Simulation Hypothesis This is the last one I’ll touch on for now. 

Simulation Hypothesis is the notion that we’re all living in a simulated computer program, and it applies to the Fermi Paradox because it’s as valid an answer any other. 

The programmers didn’t put any other intelligences besides us in the simulated universe. 

Now I raise this one because it’s a non-answer and like a lot of other handwaves in the Fermi Paradox and other philosophical conundrums. 

No different then questions like “Is this all a dream?” or “Do we have free will?”. 

You can’t disprove them or prove them and beyond being decent mental exercises they don’t go anywhere, you eventually just say “If this is all a dream and I assume it isn’t, I lose nothing, if it isn’t a dream and I assume it is, I lose a lot, therefore I can’t prove it one way or another but I might as well assume it isn’t a dream.” Fundamentally though Simulation Hypothesis is no different then Zoo Hypothesis or Quarantine – the idea that aliens are out there but keep us in an elaborate deception that they aren’t. 

Or that aliens walk among us, or that God made the whole Universe just for us. 

I don’t throw any of those out there with scorn, but they’re not worth deep examination because they’re not scientific. 

By which I mean they’re not testable and you can’t control the outcome. 

That doesn’t mean they’re not true, but you can’t devise a means to prove they aren’t true. 

They’re not testable, they are not falsifiable. 

The aliens, or programmers, or God, can pop in when they want to and say “Hi, here I am”, but you can’t test it without their help. 

The Dyson Dilemma can feel a bit like that but it isn’t. 

Just like them, or any Fermi Paradox solution, it goes right out the window if they show up tomorrow but we can’t really test it right now. 

But we CAN test it. 

First we can keeping looking for signal or Dyson Spheres and if we find them, its proven false. 

Second we can actually get out there and start setting up our own, if during that we find out its not a good idea then we know why others might think the same and not have done it, or if we sit here on Earth for ten thousand years without going anywhere else we have evidence indicating others might not have explored and expanded either. 

So that’s the summary note on the Dyson Dilemma and the Fermi Paradox in general, technological civilizations are either incredibly rare or we’ve got some serious flaws in other concepts we take for granted. 

Hope you found this informative, and have a great day.

Megastructures (Original Summary Version)
---
  
2014-09-17  
https://youtu.be/M8ryqjyLBL8  

---

Welcome. This video we'll be covering various types of megastructures and artificial worlds and constructs which you'll be familiar with from science or science fiction. We'll be covering everything from NEO low horizon orbital types which might have a dozen or so people inside it. Up to things the size of planets or even the size of solar systems like a Dyson Sphere. For that reason we have an ad-hoc classification system which will be using that roughly NEO stellar classifications. We'll go over that in just a moment. First though let me add a quick thank you and plug for Steve Bowers who provided the majority of the images will be using here and the Orion's Arm project. Orion's Arm is a shared sci-fi setting that is also a wonderful resource for looking into a lot of the other megastructures in detail and many of the sci-fi subjects which are covered in the encyclopedia Galactica. 

They also have one of the most comprehensive collections of links for writers and sci-fi fans in terms of tools and maps that you can use for your own interests. 

So that's a site definitely worth checking out - orionsarm.com. 

So let's go ahead and move into our classification system. First type is types. 

We have artificial gravity, situations where it's not applicable, rotational gravity, spherical or classical gravity and zero or microgravity. 

Where artificial gravity is concerned this is the situation you're most familiar with from science fiction films that there is simply no way to produce films in zero gravity or microgravity so in TV and film they typically just have artificial gravity of some sort. 

We won't be using too many examples of that but it is worth noting as a class that we'll see a few of. 

We also have a lot of situations where it simply won't apply. 

Like the Lofstrom Launch Loop. The gravity that's there is really not related to the object or there's simply no reason why we care about the gravity there, like a giant space gun or railgun. It has nothing to do with the purpose of the object. 

The one we'll spend the most time on is rotational gravity. 

This is a spin gravity case where the experience of gravity is felt by the fact that you're being pinned to the floor by centrifugal forces. 

We have an awful lot of examples of that we'll be going over one at a time but it probably makes up the bulk of all cases. We are also going to try to avoid getting too math heavy but there is an equation that's relevant for rotating habitats that matters. The acceleration which for earth gravity be 9.8 meters per second squared that you would want to have to simulate gravity requires that you spin the station at a given velocity based on its radius and that's the velocity squared divided by the radius. Our next type is spherical or classic gravity this won't always be just a planet or an asteroid but it is the most well-known example this is straight real gravity that you're experiencing. 

So this does not necessarily have to be caused by a classic planet. There are a number of situations you can create where you would have gravity from mass but the planet is not the same size as Earth or might not have a terrestrial natural origin. 

These come in as nearly as many shapes and sizes as the ring spinning habitats do and we'll be looking at quite a few of these. 

Then our last category which is simply zero gravity or microgravity. These are circumstances where the habitat, the space station or the artificial world just does not have any significant amount of gravity felt by the people inside. 

Besides the space station you could have habitats full of a large inflated balls full of air. 

Our next category that we'll be looking at ... classification system is size. 

These things again can range from the size of the space station all the way up to things as big as the solar system. So we have a set order of magnitude scale to look at this. 

We'll give a number N where N is ten to the nth power in terms of its width in meters. 

So N equals 1 would be 10 meters N equals 2 would be 100 meters N equals 3 will be 1000 meters N equals 6 would be a million meters and so on. So type and size will be combined as follows: Z1 would be a zero gravity environment about 10 meters across like the space station a large rotating habitats several miles long would be a R4 something the size of the earth and almost all of the planets you normally associated as being a planet that you could live on would be a S7 indicating a spehrical gravity and is about ten thousand kilometers or 10 million meters across and then an A11 would be something with artificial gravity about the size of Earth's orbit around the Sun like a Dyson Sphere our last category is habitability now for all purposes we're just going to say that one hectare which is a 100-meter x 100-meter area about the size of a acre is about how much space you need for one person to grow all their food and have some forested garden area it's a very approximate figure but Earth has about 14 billion hectares of land including unusable stuff like deserts and polar regions and about 7 billion people or roughly ten to the tenth power this conveniently gives us the roman numeral X for 10 and we use that same ten to the nth system so X would be what it would be for earth and other planets and s7x would be your typical planet that was fully populated this shots our handy guide and we'll be using this classification only very approximately because a hunter-gatherer civilization for instance would be about too lower on the chart they don't need one hectare per person they need around a hundred alternatively with very intensive hydroponics or aeroponics and artificial lighting you can easily get a hundred people fed off of one hectare and you could have sci-fi settings for instance or futures of humanity where you don't even eat food you you run on electricity so it's an approximate scale and X conveniently is about the population of a planet we only be using this for when you'd expect that the place in question to be mostly self-sufficient as a kind of artificial planet even when they're not terribly huge themselves in a lot of situations the habitability index just doesn't apply for those where it does the classification will look a lot like this Z1i or Z1 one would be the space station it's got very few people on it the R4v or R4 five for example would be a situation about 100,000 people S7x again being earth would be an example of a place that could handle some billions of people and then the case for Dyson Sphere its tens of billions of billions of people who would live in that kind of circumstance with the same space that you would have on Earth so since the artificial and not applicable categories don't really have any kind of specific shape and come in so many different varieties we'll start with the rotating gravity ones as specific examples it's also important to understand that these things do not necessarily have to appeal from the outside as a cylinder when you're dealing with a ship or when you're dealing with a space station they are cylindrical in terms of parts that have gravity they can have a non-rotating shell outside them you can actually go ahead and embed them right into an asteroid for instance and the in thing that comes up sometimes with this is your hear people say let's hollow out an asteroid and spin it you would never actually do that the gravity that these things under gets higher the further you are from the axis of rotation most asteroids are loosely held together balls of gravel they have a very weak surface gravity and you actually spun the entire asteroid at speeds to produce artificial gravity for humans they were flying apart nor do you need to spend them you just need to make sure there was no few metres of room between the actual spinning object and some shell you've constructed inside the asteroid the other thing of note with these is that you can only build them as wide in terms of radius or diameter as something that can actually handle that force on earth would be able to handle it's like a suspension bridge that's as long as the circumference of the station many materials just cannot handle you know miles and miles long circumferences Now let's actually get into all specific examples this is Von Braun's space station from 1952 one the original designs and one that is pretty familiar looking it's not a very large object it's less than a hundred meters across and it's got room for less than a hundred people on it NASA did quite a few of these kind of mockups in late fifties and early sixties and this is a hexagonal rotating one, designed to be inflated from the early sixties it wasn't very long before people started envisioning much larger places places where people would actually live as opposed to tight confined spaces you'd find at a place of business a post in the Antarctic that sort of thing one of the first of these is the Standford Torus there's also the Bernal Sphere which is another one from that era and these are designed of the assumption that you're using steel to make them these are examples will generally known as O'Neill cylinders named for John O'Neill and work on an assumption that you're powering these things with the light of the local sun that they're some kilometers across or miles across and that they could be home to many thousands tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of people one example is a lot of people be familiar with from science fiction is the Babylon 5 space station and TV show these are work on the assumption you just cannot build a space station more than about 10 kilometers in diameter before it's going to start ripping itself apart from normal metals here's another example from the city of Enoch project you can check out their facebook page at this point we have to go into objects that are much bigger that can only be built out of things that could not be conceived of until the mid nineties when we discovered carbon nanotubes and graphene these are substance you put a lot about and what let us think about ideas like space elevators at this point in time you're no longer discussing things that a few thousand people can live on something the size of a city maybe a metropolis you're looking at things that are size of large countries there's a picture of Great Britain it is actually to scale there Great Britain is about a thousand kilometers from top to bottom this thing is about 500 kilometers wide it's about 2,000 kilometers in diameter so it is actually pretty close to the size of the eastern united states in terms of total land area but the bishop ring is just saw the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with graphene and nanotubes the McKendree cylinder is the next biggest one and it's actually several thousand kilometers long and as wide as the Bishop Ring here you have an object that's capable of housing potentially nearly a planetary population that have the i the ix the 9 population for habitability you could fit a billion people on this thing quite comfortably it's typically again several thousand kilometers long the thing is enormous and you can put multiple levels in there as well we typically picture these just having that one level open sky but they could be many many levels high and in this picture for instance that is not a close-up of the McKendree cylinder relative to a planet that's actually about the scale of a McKendree cylinder again its many thousands of kilometers long it does not necessarily need to have those light absorption discs by the way that's just the assumption that you don't have some power source that could let you simulate sunlight now no matter what you do there are certain limitations on how big you can make these things using classic materials as we said but you can still keep scaling up as one solid object an example of that is a Rungworld where each of those little rungs on that apparent ladder going around a circle could be something size of an O'Neill cylinder or a McKendree cylinder so that thing could be the size of several planets or can wrap around an entire star One orbital habitat that's of special note is the Banks orbital named for Ian M Banks the late and great author of the cultural series this is an orbital that specifically the necessary radius to produce Earth like gravity and have a day length brought by its own natural sun that it's in orbit around that is exactly the same as a day on there and for Earth that's several million kilometers across these things are typically the size of a couple hundred Earths when they are set up that way you can make them a lot thicker though but that's always going to be unique size for a given day length and a given gravity there's only going to be one exact size that can make that configuration next we have a very popular one the Ringworld first again popularized by Larry Niven in the book titled that this is an orbital habitat that is placed around a star typically at the distance from it that Earth is and it's going to be about the size of a couple of million Earths less well-known but from the same author is a Topopolis or a spaghetti world this is a thin rotating habitat that's simply very very long you can wrap it around a star several times and so long as it's much longer than it is wide it has no problem spinning even when you call it around just like a rope so you can spin around a star and these can be pretty much any length you want something like the Rungworld or the Topopolis example is a Polyhedral habitat which is sometimes called Bucky habitat these can be very very large wrapped around entire stars but they are essentially a long connection of cylinder habitats whether they're McKendree sized objects or the O'Neill cylinder type objects and again mckendree objects are usually thousand kilometers long whereas only $PERCENT or so on doors are usually in the tens of kilometers law a movie on to the next class vehicle gravity I want to talk about hybrid example a lot of times when you're walking with a moon base or emulsion base from someplace with a gravity exists and is significant but isn't what you want you to be stuck with that in fiction or examples but you don't actually have to be you can combine the rotational gravity and spherical gravity or classic gravity much like a washing machine when you put water it will spin and former parabola you can arrange to have the sides of your habitat slope like that so that you spend the habitat it will combine the gravity that's caused by the local man and by spinning to produce a gravity equal to that of off and if you're on a vacuum environment like the moon there's no real reason why you wouldn't do that a bit of a hassle little energy intensive but not actually all that bad on next major category is feel gravity classic gravity now this is a much build category that you initially think we're not just talking about large moons classic planets and we're also including shell wards examples of this would be where you construct the board around large object like a black hole which could be smaller than a planet or larger because it's not official black hole around the gas giant or even just compressed gas this isn't strictly limited to super-powerful material was that allow you to make a rigid shell the size of multiple planets this requires though that you use something called active support the easiest way to think of active support would be a garden hose that was connected to a pump at both ends once you turn the pump on the holes were immediately spring into a sachal even do this with magnetically propelled small particles moving mass stream so that you can create widget objects in a circular form that are just huge and size we call this active support because no matter how efficient you make this system there's going to be some energy last so you're going to have to constantly be adding power and assistant hold your plan together all that a hoarder polish so it doesn't fall together and this can be done it's probably scientifically possible it's a little bit ahead of us right now because it's just huge and energy consumption of but is one alternative space elevators you could make one of these rings that was hoping just above the atmosphere of the planet and just connect shortalls a few miles I to it another example of natural gravity would be a shell ward in this case a matryoshka doll time situation where it's just layer after layer of contention of concentric spheres around each other you have to unofficially like those and you have knowledge pillows that helped hold up the sky and a very atlas like example here each Leo either has a slightly higher gravity to get for them out or if you space them out phone off you can keep it at the same stable gravity by just having a different distance treats layoffs you want to take a moment to avoid confusing this with a matryoshka brain which is another type of contract will discuss later on your heel this time a lot more often than the shell for example come back to that later on another example would be a hoop war-torn swore don't ward call what you would in this example you have something knows about 10 times the size of Earth so long as the hoops diameter is much wider than that of the actual thing itself you're going to have perfectly normal gravity on this office our next category of microgravity habitats these can come in almost any type of sale no such as the space station with Space Shuttle all the way up to self-contained wards general just full of fail this another artificial ward that was popularized by lady Nevin him as well as dr. Freeman Dyson and Paul borch were some of the guys who came up with almost all these ideas very impressive the smoking example he actually has a large are loosely held together atmosphere around and I'll stall in another bulge donut shape but there's also self-contained varieties such as the at us feel we are the here it's got advertising on the outside of it but inside here you have a low-gravity environment where you can breathe and where it's a warm temperature but you'd have to have artificial lighting and again it's zero gravity some of our balls are more popular examples like discords here's an example one that's a couple thousand kilometers across this where you live on a flat off one side or both sides then big enough they could have their own gravity but we usually think this is something with artificial gravity probably the best-known fictional example of this is the discord by terry pratchett great series a fantasy parody novels as well as the outer sandisk now normally in addison disc is not considered a really great one to use we were just like it's very large armed it's surrounds and tile stone but it's pretty much always in a constant perpetual haze of twilight and does not get a lot of light you can get around this and the way that you would usually do that would be to float meals over your stall that will set up two cars a day and night cycle this is where we get into another one of those concepts will be using a little later on koristad ID that's short for a static satellite this is something that much like a solar sail is pushed on by sunlight nor to move in this case though it's hung exactly at the distance where the solar pressure and the gravity equal out for that object so that does not fall into the Sun or get for the way with statics you can float meals over the Sun one big one or hundreds of their tiny ones we're going to move on the class are called Stella of engines and the classic example this is a Dyson Sphere again a Dyson Sphere is a couple billion times bigger than Earth in terms of Lance office although a real one would probably be a little bit further out from the Sun and authors because of that day night cycle where you might have some static meals around actually mimic that but it has two sides one dark one light if you only get daylight the entire time as far away as authors from the Sun you're going to melt pretty quickly you need to be a little bit for them out than that fundamentally at dyson sphere's just not really a stable object and of itself it can even drift into its own star and needs artificial gravity so we usually talk about a dyson swarm instead this is identical to a Dyson Sphere except it's composed of unless millions and billions even trillions of rotating habitats or standards the other aspect of dyson swarm is it doesn't have to be complete and you can build up in stages so you could have a dyson swarm that only would say one percent coverage or absorption light and build that out of local materials a lot easier than you can actually dyson sphere where you're probably not going to have enough your matter to make good thick shells and Dyson swarms are also a little bit unstable so we also will catch you talk about a Jenkins swarm which is a sort of a very large donation amount of style of various swarm objects rotating bodies or Chapel these don't follow circular orbits though they follow a slightly elliptical path that brings up a little bit closer on for the way from the Sun and you'd probably use that to simulate your seasons we mentioned the matryoshka pain earlier this is an object it's basically a Dyson Sphere Dyson swarm well instead of it being for people to live on you're using all their collective power to bunny single massive supercomputer weird Isis viewers almost incomprehensible huge in terms of how many people can support a matryoshka brain is almost in comprehensive huge are even more so in terms of how many calculations can form especially cuz it's assumed to be done by computer much more advanced in terms of micro sizing than our current ones are you'd expect an object like this too it was treated as a human mind be one that was trillions of trillions of trillions of times faster than a human next category of stellar engine are the ones designed to remove mass from last all-star lifting swarm or start lifting ring and this is basically how you go about killing a stall but isn't really weaponize about this requires a lot of infrastructure to do basically it relies around using the magnetic field that a star has and setting up a ring around it or swim around at bet is going in the opposite direction to basically rip matter off and comes to admit at the northern and southern ports of the planet and the magnetic field is very intense and by by setting up of being around that spins and superconducting magnet you can turn off gigatonnes of matter from that style of potentially reducing it down to nothing eventually big stars are much better and live a lot less time they also bought a much smaller percentage of hydrogen so it's reasonable to say that you might take a larger star than all yellow sun and strip matter away from it so that lives longer or even a Yellow Sun to strip it down to be an event war which live for many hundreds of billions or trillions of years and used up almost all the hydrogen so they could be seen as much longer more efficient engines now if you actually want to move a stall or solar system you have what's called the Chicago Russell this is basically a half meal amount of stall and you often have a lot closer to the stall then you would have died since field because you just need to make sure it's not so close it doesn't melt this would be a state ID or swimmers tonight's like pushed on the from one direction and it pushed back in the opposite direction the light from the star goes out in one general direction and this causes a force to be pushed on the meal and the style and the entire solar system slowly accelerating up to high speeds it takes millions of years to move any significant distance billions of years to move in our galactic scale but this does actually work just fine it should be noted that the rate at which accelerates is related to the luminosity and mass the stall the right is the fast moves to have it is the slower moves but stars actually raise their luminosity or how but they are much faster than their mass an order of about the cube or fourth power so a very bright stall such as one could go supernova is an ideal candidate to hit with a shikara first because you can move it very quickly not really a red wolf will take a very long time to accelerate up this way those are your stellar engines now that's not the absolute end of things there are many contracts have been thought through even bigger on the galactic scale the only one I'm going to take a moment to mention is a one of the examples pub or given way are you take a galactic size black hole we're talking about black heel of many millions of stops of solar masses like the kind you find the center of the galaxy and you build a shell around that like the super Monday know shell Wars be discussed and then you put another shell around that and another shell amount that's and another shell around that obviously these have to be actively supported you can put in so many layers that you're not just talking about a Dyson Sphere hear you talk about something that's almost as big to a Dyson Sphere as a Dyson Sphere Liz to the earth and you can actually live inside this thing you could have endless layers of shell Wars of office trillions of or swath of area to live on and what's interesting is that the lowest levels time is actually running slower from the distortion effect though there's no title for sustaining your part then is the highest level so at the lower levels time runs slowly at the higher levels that runs the normal time and this is the best of my knowledge the biggest biggest construction could ever make that would have human habitability by normal people I'm a little posture it not just because it's a so immensely huge compared to a Dyson Sphere but because it's by the center of the galaxy and seems like would be an amazingly cool capital for galactic empire so that's we're going to go ahead and finish off there's a lot of arm megastructures we did not even touch on i would certainly encourage you to research more of those but these are almost the general one that you'd expect to ever really see used multiple times I'm a different settings or in science in general anyway I hope you've enjoyed this and thanks for watching
